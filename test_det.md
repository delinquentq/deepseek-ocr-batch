# Take profit of short SGDCCH  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[70, 203, 652, 319]]<|/det|>
We take profit in our short SGDCCH trade. The completion of forward book unwinding, a stronger CNY bias in daily fixings, and better risk sentiment have driven USDCCH lower. We think the PBoC will try to limit speculative USDCCH short and loosen control on fixing post the military parade.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[70, 339, 657, 504]]<|/det|>
We take profit on our short SGDCCH 6m forward (entry: 5.6232; target: 5.3500; stop- loss: 5.7600): at 5.5450, locking in a potential gain of around \(1.4\%\) . We initiated the trade to express our view that the MAS and PBoC are diverging in terms of their NEER management. We discussed in \(5CNY\) . On the edge of a cliff that Chinese state banks' unwinding of their short forward books, which have been stalling CNY appreciation, is at least half finished, and the PBoC could loosen its tight grip on USDCNY spot to help support the CFETS. This appears to have occurred, as reflected in the daily USDCNY fixing and a rise in CFETS above 95. The SGD leg was to take advantage of the current strong SGD NEER position within the band (c.143bp above the mid by our model estimate) and a likely more active MAS stance in defending the top of the SGD NEER band.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[70, 515, 660, 749]]<|/det|>
A few tailwinds have supported the CNY over the past few months: corporates have stepped up their Fx conversions (Figure 1), a firmer signal from the central bank via a stronger CNY bias in daily USDCNY fixings (Figure 2), the likely completion of forward book unwinding by Chinese banks and much better risk sentiment as reflected in A- shares. Chinese corporates sold USD59.39bn of dollar in net Fx settlement from May to July, while banks are stalling CNY appreciation by net buying USD10.41bn over the same period. Moreover, the sudden drop in the USDCNY fixing from 7.13 to 7.10 in the last week of August also surprised the market, likely reflecting the PBoC's intention to keep CNY firm ahead of the military parade on 3 September to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory Day and the end of World War II, with 26 foreign leaders scheduled to attend, including the president of Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Other future events, including National Day on 1 October, could keep the USDCNY fixing sticky at 7.10- 7.11. That said, we believe the broad dollar will move back into the driver's seat over the next few weeks, with US nonfianl payrolls, US CPl and FOMC meeting dominant price action. In our view, the PBoC is likely to be reactive in terms of its response to USDCNY.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[70, 750, 660, 856]]<|/det|>
Our preference is to be long CFETS rather than outright short USDCNH. The adverse carry cost to be short USDCNH implies in our view that investors are not going to jump into the trade unless momentum picks up. For now, we believe the relatively more constructive China story could yield upside risks for Asian assets, while the CNY will act as an anchor for regional Fx (Long CNY CFETS). As we highlighted in China: Rinse and repeat, a significant CNY rally would require tailwinds from DXY softness.

Sustainable investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainabie', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate- friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversie. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universall classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversie exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
