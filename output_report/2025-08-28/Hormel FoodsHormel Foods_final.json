As we noted earlier this week (Sentiment Check), we heard some concerns from investors ahead of the print about rising pork costs, but the expected impact was perhaps \\(0.01 - 0.02\\) per share and not the \\(0.07\\) EPS miss that occurred with lingering headwinds into FY26. After talking to the company, we have a better understanding of why earnings are facing so much anticipated pressure. We also see reasons for optimism going forward and remain Overweight rated on the shares. HRL's volumes are trending better Y/Y than for most food peers and could improve further as Planters laps last year's lingering disruptions. Pricing actions could soon start to offset inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures could ease (pork prices often seasonally decline in the fall). Turkey margins still seem likely to infect meaningfully higher next year. And it is also possible that HRL baked in some added conservatism in its forward commentary - which, in our experience, is not unusual when new CEOs start. That said, we do not want to brush over the lingering risks - guidance has seldom proven conservative in recent years, and it is surprising to us that elevated input costs are presenting such an enduring margin headwind, when so much of HRL's portfolio is traditionally able to pass through pricing in a relatively efficient manner.",

      "text": "Why were commodity moves so disruptive for HRL's earnings? Short answer: Tough timing. HRL indicated that bellies, trim, and beef all moved higher during the quarter (most starting in June, shortly after its earnings call). It was not able to pass through pricing on associated products (e.g., bacon, dry sausage, SPAM, chili) in a timely manner, which caused outsized margin pressure that it expects to linger through 4Q25. Especially for bellies, we did not think the rate of change was so abnormal relative to prior years. However, it appears that the timing and suddenness of the price move caught HRL a bit flat- footed.",

In late 2022, HRL was caught with excess pork inventory because it anticipated higher demand. When pork costs declined (partially on seasonality), HRL's prices on products like bacon declined on a lag versus spot markets; however, HRL was still working through high cost inventory, which pressured margins. We wondered if a similar dynamic could be in play this year given the higher inventory level at the end",

HQL seemed to downplay this risk by noting the inventory build was on products like Skippy peanut butter) and other center store products (e.g., SP4M, chili, stew, and mash). It also noted that inflation and not higher pounds of inventory were contributing to the dollar increase. Among items with inflated inventory, the main item to monitor seems to be SPAM, which uses pork trim. We believe that inventory of SPAM was built up early in 3Q25 (when input costs were lower) and should be drawn down in 4Q25, driven by planned promotions (provided the promotions perform as HRL expects).",

Short Answer: On algo operating profit growth is probably a good starting point for FY26, with potential upside as details solidify. In his prepared remarks, Mr. Ettinger said of next year, \"While we are not providing fiscal 2026 guidance today, our belief is that our long- term growth algorithm is a better metric to use when considering our go- forward results.\" HRL's algorithm is \\(2 - 3\\%\\) OSG and \\(5 - 7\\%\\) operating profit growth. When asked about this in Q&A, he said clarified, \"We think these are aggressive but reasonable goals in today's food industry environment and I personally agree that these are the appropriate goals for our general future expectations... these are not intended as our fiscal 2026 guidance - that will come on the Q4 call when we weigh all the considerations.\" Our interpretation is that HRL sees this \\(5 - 7\\%\\) operating profit growth as a general starting point for 2026 but there are also areas that could contribute to upside, depending on how things progress (in fairness, incremental downside drivers could also emerge, as we saw this quarter).",

As noted above, we interpret HRL's comments to suggest a preliminary starting point of on algo growth next year. But we still see potential for something higher. For one thing, \\(5 - 7\\%\\) operating profit growth might suggest low \\(1.50s\\) EPS at the midpoint, but HRL's expected 4Q run rate is \\(1.56\\) ( \\(0.39 \\times 4\\) ). For another, beyond 4Q there are multiple tailwinds to consider, including (a) list price increases (which should be implemented during 4Q and 1Q), (b) higher whole bird turkey prices, and (c) perhaps cost savings (CEO Jeff Ettinger described SG&A as being too high). It is also possible that pork inflation eases at some point, especially if hog farmers ramp up supply in response to higher margins (link).",

We believe that higher commodity breast meat prices are likely translating to higher prices in Foodservice. We then look for most of the benefit from higher whole turkey prices to fall in FY26. 1Q26 should benefit from a higher mix of fresh bird sales (which tend to be more closely aligned with commodity markets). And then starting in 2Q26, HRL's annual whole bird contracts should reset to more favorable price levels.",

In its 10-Q, HRL guided for Retail profit to be \"comparable to the prior year, as the benefit from net sales growth is expected to be offset by higher input costs\" and for Foodservice profit to \"decrease compared to the prior year, as organic net sales growth is expected to be more than offset by margin pressures, primarily in non-core businesses.\" We clarified with the company that Foodservice profits are not expected to see much benefit from pass-through pricing until key commodity markets roll over (the company does not assume a big enough seasonal decline to trigger this). Plus, there is a small headwind from the HHL sale (\\(110MM annual sales and\\)0.01 EPS).

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
