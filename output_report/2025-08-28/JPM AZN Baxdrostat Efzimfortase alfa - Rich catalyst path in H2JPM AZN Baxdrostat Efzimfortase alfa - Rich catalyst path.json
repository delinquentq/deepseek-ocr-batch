      "text": "Following on from my Baxdrostat email yesterday link, I failed to point out an overlooked asset, Efzimfortase Alpha (aka ALXN 1850) HICKORY and CHESTNUT phase 3 trial read outs in Sept/October for hypophosphatasia. This is a follow on to AZN's Strensig, which reported sales of c. \\(1.4bn in FY24\\) . We believe the peak potential for Efzimfortase could be higher at c. \\(3 - 5bn\\) with the key advantage, a significantly lower injection volume as dosing is weight based. This would allow treatment of more adolescents, which currently limit the use of Strensig given the large injection volume.",

While is it too early to have a strong view on Q3 results, they have reported H1 revenue growth of \\(11\\%\\) in LC vs FY25 guidance for HSD growth while H1 core EPS grew \\(+17\\%\\) in LC vs guide for low double digit growth in LC. This could point to guidance upside at Q3 results.",
