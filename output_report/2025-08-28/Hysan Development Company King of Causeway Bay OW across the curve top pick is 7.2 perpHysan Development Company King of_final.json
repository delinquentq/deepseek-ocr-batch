With its high- quality shopping malls that account for half of its revenue, we think the company is well- positioned to benefit from an expected recovery in the Hong Kong retail property sector. Indeed, its earnings are already showing signs of recovery, and this should continue. Such recovery and the recently announced capital recycling plan should help its credit metrics to improve gradually, before accelerating into 2027 with maiden contributions from Lee Gardens Eight. We move to OW on Hysan and are OW along the curve ( \\(27\\%\\) , \\(29\\%\\) & \\(35\\%\\) ) and its perpetual bonds ( \\(7.2\\%\\) \\(c30s\\) and \\(4.85\\%\\) fixed- for- life).

Other Hong Kong property companies (e.g., Hong Kong Land, LInk REIT, Sun Hung Kai) are single- A rated and thus trading well inside of the Hysan curve. Relative to these single- A names, we believe that Hysan bonds offer relative value. Their spread pick- up (in STW terms) is currently hovering at the wider end of its historical trading range since mid- 2023.

      "text": "J.P. Morgan uses a bond- level rating system that incorporates valuations (relative value) and our fundamental view on the security. Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).",
