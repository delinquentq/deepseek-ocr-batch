Furthermore,while management did not disclose a specific timeline for the data release, it now appears unlikely that data will be included at the WCLC plenary session on Sep 7th, contrary to our expectations. With reported data cutoff in July, it would be hard to make the ESMO deadlines too (LBA still possible with Sep 9th submission deadline, but they would've had to submit a skeleton by May). Therefore, the data release could be later than October. With the data still **up in the air, we found the timing of the placement and block sale less-than-ideal.**Following a 7.1% decline yesterday, there was another 3.1% drop in the share price today.That said, most biotech and pharma stocks also corrected over the last two days, in part due tosector rotation. Tactically, we think it may be best to let the dust settle rather than 'buying the dip'.",
