Candidly, the explanation on the call of MyDay strength cannibalizing Clariti is a little confusing given the different parts of the price piano these products play in, and big picture it begins to feel like each quarter is presenting with a different heterogenous explanation for slowing growth. It's particularly perplexing given the relative strength of peers (e.g. ALC Contacts \\(+7\\%\\) , J&J \\(3\\%\\) , BLCO \\(+7\\%\\) ), and indeed, BLCO actually added the same dollar \\((\\) 16mn) value- it's contact business in the quarter as COO (despite being a fraction of the size). This (plus challenges in CSI) have left COO in a tricky spot despite the stock having derated significantly over the last year, and we're still very much in a \\(3\\) - bw- me situation. There were encouraging elements - despite pricing sounding softer in 2026 (maybe \\(+1 - 2\\%\\) industry wide vs. \\(+2 - 3\\%\\) prior) COO is committing to taking share, and the explanation for how the management team knew it was Clariti being hit by MyDay was compelling (few larger accounts that they directly called). OPEX management has also been excellent. Still, we think trust is going to take time to rebuild. We keep wanting to get more positive on COO shares, but keep running into reasons to remain on the sidelines, and need to see some stability in the decline of the growth to get comfortable, while wondering if larger strategic changes at the corporate- level could potentially end up being on the table given the relative performance versus history.",

      "text": "Key Takes from the Call: 1) Early 2026 Thoughts: While COO did not provide concrete details, it expects an acceleration in growth within both segments. For CVI, the company expects to exceed market growth of +MSD on the backs of stronger fitting volumes and launches in OUS geographies. That said, management acknowledged that price taking could be lower for contact lenses due to pressures in APAC (+1% in 2026 vs. +2- 3% historically). For CSI, management expects growth to be driven by fertility, where positive secular trends like delayed childbirth, patient awareness, and broader payer coverage remain intact. With that said, the segment continues to experience a slower capital purchasing environment as practices aim to conserve cash given the macro backdrop. 2) MyDay Greenshoots: A bright spot in the quarter was the MyDay family, where all lines grew +DD in F3Q with MyDay Multifocals up +20%. COO highlighted that fitting activity is strong and implies a growth ramp nearer term. Furthermore, the company shared that it has renewed several large contracts and won multiple private label agreements. Bolstering growth, MyDay Multifocal is expected to launch commercially in major APAC markets with the MyDay Toric parameter already actively rolled out in multiple markets. Finally, Cooper emphasized that with the completion of the latest CapEx cycle, it has significantly expanded MyDay capacity, as it expects to handle continued growth in the product. During the call, management disclosed that MyDay represents around \\(\\) 600M\\(in annual sales, which compares to\\) \\ \\(400M\\) in Clariti (total \\(\\) 1B\\(in daily silicone hydrogel). That said, it noted during the call that MyDay's margins are not as attractive as other products (e.g. Clariti), which we think could affect earnings power in 2026.",
