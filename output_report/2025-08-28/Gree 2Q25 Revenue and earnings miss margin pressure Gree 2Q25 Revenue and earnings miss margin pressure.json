Consumer electronics (mainly air conditioners) declined 5%, with IOL data showing 2Q shipment volumes up 7% YoY which implies ASPs dropping due to price wars in low-to-mid-tier segments. Emerging BtoB businesses (industrial products, green energy, smart equipment) grew in the high teens to low 20s but, at ~10% of revenue, couldn't offset the core business decline.",

This balance could also reflect an improved online sales mix, which carries lower gross margins but reduced SG&A costs. Overall operating margin actually improved 51bps YoY, supported by higher other income.",

As a company with greater exposure to mid-to-high-end segments and revenue heavily concentrated in ACs, Gree is susceptible to domestic competition eroding its market share. While some positives exist (overseas growth of 10.2%, cost control efforts, and emerging business growth), these represent too small a portion to offset core business pressures. Gree has historically maintained the highest margins among peers, but with competitors willing to operate at much lower margins, margin compression appears inevitable in 2H25, making its heavy concentration in AC a liability.",
