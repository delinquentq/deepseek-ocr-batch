This does not include any allocation for the Eva copper project or proposed acquisition of MAC Copper - guidance will be updated at FY26 interim results. The primary driver of the increase in capex is net replacement/ deferred stripping at Hidden Valley where LOM has been extended to 2030 (previously 2028).",
