This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
