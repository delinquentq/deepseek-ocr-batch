GMV from 0% APR monthly installments **jumped ~93%** year-on-year, as merchant adoption of these promotional plans more than doubled to over 25,000 participating merchants (roughly 7% of active merchants). These interest-free offers brought in many new customers - roughly 50% of all new Affirm users in the quarter started with a 0% loan. Nearly 95% of 0% APR GMV at integrated merchants is subsidized by the merchant, allowing Affirm to still earn revenue on these loans.
