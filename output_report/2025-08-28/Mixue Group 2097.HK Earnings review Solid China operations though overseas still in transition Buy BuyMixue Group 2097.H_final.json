Key takeaways: 1) The company will continue to solidify leadership in ML China market with further store penetration along with overseas expansion, enhance supply chain and system operations, strengthen Snow King IP awareness, to fuel long term sustainable growth; 2) Regarding the impact from food delivery subsidy, management noted that it has boosted volume in 1H which also benefits store level profitability, as well as helping to educate customers. That said, management also expects the subsidy level to gradually normalize, and the delivery sales growth in Jul has decelerated from Jun; 3) Leveraging the group's supply chain, Lucky Cup brand is set for fast expansion; into 2H, the brand will continue enhancing product offerings and accelerate nationwide expansion; 4) While overseas store count declined in 1H due to operation adjustment in Vietnam/Indonesia market, management noted per store sales had positive growth, and other markets (e.g. Thailand, Malaysia) are progressing smoothly; it has also been expanding to new markets, including entering Kazakhstan in 1H, and stores are in pipeline for multiple America countries; 5) On margin, the diversified raw material and scale/supply chain advantages help to offset single material price risk; management expects the OPEX ratio to be stable in the 2H with operating leverage offsetting the business investment impact.",

We believe MIXUE has a meaningful opportunity to take increasing share in the beverage intake market in China and overseas markets. While Mixue is currently trading at a similar 2025E P/E level compared to the average of FMD/ beverage players in our coverage, we see further upside to valuation given its stronger growth outlook; we are Buy rated.
