      "text": "Change at the STB seems likely. Supreme Court has upheld the Administration's rights to remove individuals from independent agencies, at least temporarily. In Trump v. Wilcox (2025), the Supreme Court allowed the Administration to fire officials from the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. That action, issued in an emergency ruling, allowed the terminations to remain in effect while the case was appealed. It effectively, if temporarily, overturned a unanimous ruling by the Court in 1935 known as \"Humphrey's Executor\" which established the precedent that the Congress could establish independent agencies and protect their leadership from dismissal without cause. The ruling was temporary, but a good indicator of where the Court sits on the issue of firing the heads of independent agencies (with a carve out for the Fed). This makes it a very difficult fight for Primus to win, in our view.",

A White House spokesman indicated that Primus was removed because he did not align with the President's agenda and that the White House intends to nominate \"new, more qualified\" members to the STB in short order. Recall that Primus was the sole \"no\" vote on the CPKC transaction. The Board as now constituted has 2 Republican appointees (Chair Fuchs, Member Schulz) and 1 Democratic appointee (Member Hedlund). We have heard concerns in the market about approval hinging on the \\(5^{\\text{th}}\\) to be named member...it now hinges on the appointment of two new members. Recall that last week Commerce Secretary Lutnick said he would leave it up to the Regulator decide on mergers.",

Recall that during the first Trump Administration, the then President signed an Executive Order streamlining environmental review for infrastructure projects. More recently, the Administration expedited environmental reviews tied to data center build outs that support AI development. We have to think that the Administration could be open to an accelerated environmental review of this transaction, which could help close a deal faster than the year and a half most investors we speak to expect.",
