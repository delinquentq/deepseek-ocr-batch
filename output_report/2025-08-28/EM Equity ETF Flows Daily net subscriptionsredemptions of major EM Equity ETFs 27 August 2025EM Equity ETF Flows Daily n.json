NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
