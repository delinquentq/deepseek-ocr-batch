      "text": "Our Take: Delivery Hero reported what we consider to be a good set of Q225 results, with revenues beating by \\(4\\%\\) and GMV in line. Group EBITDA for H1 came in \\(7\\%\\) ahead of consensus (company- collated) expectations (see tables below). The focus will be on FY25 guidance which was cut (see below) driven by FX effects (mostly Korea but also MENA which is pegged to the USD). The company also adjusted for the close- down of businesses in Thailand and a small part of Glovo Spain. Lower guidance (and a likely \\(8\\%\\) cut to EBITDA for FY25) are likely to have a negative impact on the shares this morning at open, but we highlight that on an underlying basis (i.e. ex FX, ex business closures) guidance was not cut and would have been achieved. Also, trading conditions in Asia are improving and the company generated its first positive EBIT (€5m) in H1. As highlighted earlier, we continue to believe in our \"JustiFoodHero\" theme (note here) and view Delivery Hero as having (still) strategic value for Prosus, with the sell- down potentially re- assessed once the Just Eat transaction has closed. We reiterate our OW on the name and see a buying opportunity on any weakness today.",

EBITDA margin at \\(1.7\\%\\) of GMV; 5) Free Cash Flow improved by €96m YoY during H1, resulting in H125 FCF of - €8m; 6) The company maintained a strong cash balance at €2.8bn, following the convertible bond buybacks of €896m during Q1; 7) contingent liabilities have slightly increased (new range €562 and €923m).",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
