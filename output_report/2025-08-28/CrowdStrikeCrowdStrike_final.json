      "text": "Solid 2Q beat with better than expected NNARR acceleration into the back half of the year. CRWD delivered better- than- expected results for 2Q with revenue, ARR, profitability, and FCF all ahead of consensus estimates. ARR performance was supported by traction with Cloud, Next- Gen Identity and NextGen SIEM which together accounted for more than \\(\\) 1.56bn\\(of ARR. Underlying growth was supported by strong Falcon Flex traction with more than 1,000 customers now on Flex. Total revenue growth was also supported by stronger than anticipated Professional Services business due to greater than anticipated Incident Response business in the quarter. The stock initially traded off after hours as revenue guidance was a bit weaker than anticipated, with a lack of meaningful upside after this Q and Professional Services momentum that implies a softer outlook for Subscription revenue in the back half of the year. But CRWD also guided to NNARR acceleration to at least \\(40\\%\\) y/y growth in the back half of the year driving total ARR growth of over \\(22\\%\\) y/y for the year, which we think will mitigate some concerns around the company's ability to maintain \\(20\\% +\\) growth near term. Management noted that confidence in NNARR acceleration is supported by 1) customers re- flexing at a faster rates than expected, 2) a strong pipeline of Next- GEN SIEM transition business, and 3) visibility into renewal business as customers lap CCP initiatives. The company's announced acquisition of Onum is not included in ARR guidance as the deal has not yet closed, but Onum could support better Next- Gen SIEM growth into next year. Fal. con could also be a positive catalyst and driver of better growth into FY27. This year's event is sold out at capacity of \\(\\sim 8,000\\) and will be followed by a similar event in Barcelona which is shaping up to be \\(2.5x\\) larger than last year. Both events are healthy lead generation events for the company. We remain encouraged by ongoing platform traction as ARR acceleration supports an outlook of better growth and profitability exit rates this year. We are adjusting our estimates to reflect current period results and outlook and remain Overweight rated as we see evidence the company has been able to leverage incentives to accelerate market penetration, consolidate share onto its platform, and emerge as a dominant best- in- class platform.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analyst's coverage universe.
