On the other hand, we remain cautious on the company's core business margins (currently c.5pp above industry normalized level), which might not be sustainable given its portfolio mix change towards more lower- end segment and macro uncertainties. The company reported 1H25 core profit at Rmb1.6bn, down \\(15\\%\\) yoy (a narrower contraction pace vs. \\(- 23\\%\\) in FY24) and equivalent to \\(53\\%\\) of prior full- year GSe (broadly inline), with upbeat core business topline \\((+15\\%)\\) yoy, ahead of most PM peers despite CGS' already substantial scale) yet another 3pp yoy GPM deterioration. Though 1H cash profile witnessed some hiccups (OCF outflow enlarged by Rmb0.6bn and AR balance gross \\(8\\%\\) yoy) due to seasonality, one- off advanced payment, etc., blended collection rate notably improved 4pp yoy to \\(90\\%\\) alongside tech- empowered collection mechanisms. Management kept constructive 25E guidance intact - a HSD% yoy topline expansion pace, bottoming- out core profit trend, coupled with an above 1X OCF/NI ratio on the back of \\(100\\%\\) full- year blended collection rate. Since we added the stock to our Sell list on 1/13/2025, CGS' share price increased \\(28\\%\\) vs. coverage average \\(+20\\%\\) and MSCI China \\(+36\\%\\) , due to increasing dividend hike possibility after announced loan to controlling shareholder.",

We note strengthening external project sourcing by the company, with its newly obtained 3P GFA surging \\(66\\%\\) yoy in 1H25, as CGS engages low- end residential projects inside its \\(300+\\) city footprint via its value- for- money and differentiated service packages as well as explores opportunities from old community renovation, sending the company's management scale up \\(3\\%\\) from end- 24 level to 1.06bn sqm (vs. most POE PM peers registering declining/flattish GFA during 1H25). Management also commented that multiple niche specialized 2C services that CGS restructured/incubated over the past years could be entering fast- growing phases (e.g. spirits sales, vehicle energy- charging business, etc.) and the company is aiming for 5 of such 2C VAS sub- segments to reach Rmb1bn revenue scale by 28E; and 2) strengthened collection rate: blended collection rate increased 4pp yoy to \\(90\\%\\) (vs. many peers reported yoy deteriorated collection performance in 1H25 amid macro adversity), on the back of various tech- empowered collection mechanisms. Management is confident to achieve \\(100\\%\\) collection for the full- year 25E (up c.5pp yoy). This, coupled with the company's active exits from low- cash- performance projects and contracts over the past years, could underpin a Rmb3bn level core cash profit outlook by 27E, in our view.",
