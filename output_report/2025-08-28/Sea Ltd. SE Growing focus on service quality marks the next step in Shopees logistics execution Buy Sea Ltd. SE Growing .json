With this report, we seek to provide more clarity on which areas Shopee has been reinvesting in as part of its growing focus on service quality, which in our view marks the next stage in Shopee's logistics execution. This is also in line with Shopee's overall strategy where growth remains the near- term priority, and it is not rushing to maximize profitability. Moreover, management has previously highlighted that once relative logistics cost advantage is achieved, it intends to reinvest in improving user experience instead of making logistics a profit center.",

While Shopee is pushing sellers to fulfill faster, it's also doing its part through subsidizing discounts and marketing campaigns (emphasizing Shopee as the fastest & cheapest platform) to promote buyer uptake, likely also requiring additional operational investments. While the recurring fee earned from VIP may be offset by the cost of providing benefits (especially in the initial phase), experiences from developed peers suggest that subscriptions should be profit- accretive over time due to uplift in buyer spend from increased loyalty (higher frequency & basket size, lower churn/cost of re- acquiring) while reinforcing Shopee's moat.",
