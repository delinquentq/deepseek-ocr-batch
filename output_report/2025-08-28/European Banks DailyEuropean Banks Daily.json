Today both FSFL and FGEN have announced that they have exchanged contracts for the sale of their stakes in Lunanhead, a 50MW BESS asset located in Perthshire, Scotland, at a price that is in line with the 30/6/25 carrying value and completion of the deal is due later this quarter. FGEN says the Lunanhead sale represents less than 0.2% of its total portfolio value. Both FSFL and FGEN say their investment managers are exploring options for Clayfords, another 50MW BESS asset jointly owned. Both FSFL and FGEN also say that a third BESS asset, Sandridge BESS, a 50MW battery storage project in Wiltshire that the two funds jointly own, has been energised and the site will now begin final commissioning and testing, with commercial operations due shortly thereafter. FSFL and FGEN each say that their boards and managers have been considering developing the BESS asset sold against alternative capital uses, including developing the asset or using capital for buybacks or debt repayment and decided the sale was the best option.",

It may be possible that the bank is looking to lock in higher- duration securities portfolio in a bid to sustain NIMs in a lower- yield environment going forward.

The key drivers for this re- rating are as follows: First, there is a strong correlation between the growth outlook and PE multiple. Futu has demonstrated significant growth in clients, AUM, revenue, and profits since 2024, yet the multiple re- rating has lagged (current 26E PE of 20x vs historical FY1 mean of 23x). Second, we believe strong client acquisition in HK/SG/MY, rise in wallet share per client and digital assets development will further drive growth momentum. Third, Futu is trading at a steep discount to peers (Hood, IBKR & EM), despite a better growth outlook. With an easing of the regulatory overhang, we expect the discount to narrow. We remain OW.",
