Bankruptcies have also increased the optionality for real estate and we see potential upside to stores opening in 2025 and 2026. While OLLI raised their FY25 guidance, we note that management tends to be conservative as 4Q guidance remains unchanged with a LSD comp; we highlight that OLLI will likely see further strength into the 2H as their product pipeline continues to maintain strong price gaps. Moreover, we are constructive on their focused priority towards acquiring new OLLI Army members, as it will drive stronger top- line performance and increase their market share. The success of their recent June Army Night is indicative of the member engagement they can have during the Holiday season. We raise our price target to \\(\\) 158\\(from\\) \\ \\(147\\)",

Management stated that although they had an unusually high number of severe medical cases this quarter, they expect these expenses to eventually improve given they are seeing early signs of softening trends. Despite the higher claims, management still beat with an \\(11.3\\%\\) operating margin (vs. GS/consensus of \\(11.1\\% /10.8\\%\\) ), driven by strong top line performance and their resulting \\(39.9\\%\\) gross margin beat (vs. GS/consensus of \\(39.5\\% /39.0\\%\\) ). The strong gross margin was driven by merchandising margins, which benefited from strong deal flow and buying power. Specifically, because OLLI has strong vendor partnerships, they are able to negotiate deal pricing and drive better cost margins, while still obtaining compelling assortment. OLLI's size and scale, as well as their supply chain efficiencies, also contributed to this beat as they are able to take on more deal volume and flow products better through their distribution centers.
