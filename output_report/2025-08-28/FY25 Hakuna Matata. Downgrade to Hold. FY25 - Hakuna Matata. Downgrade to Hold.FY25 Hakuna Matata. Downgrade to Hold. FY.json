These measures aim to strengthen the total quantity control and management of rare earth mining and smelting separation, based on the Mineral Resources Law of the People's Republic of China, the Rare Earth Management Regulations, and other relevant laws and regulations.  \n2. Rare Earth Mining refers to the extraction and beneficiation of various rare earth ores such as bastnaesite, ion-type rare earth ores, and mixed rare earth ores to produce rare earth mineral products. Rare Earth Smelting and Separation refers to the processing of rare earth mineral products into various single or mixed rare earth oxides, salts, and other compounds.  \n3. The state implements total quantity control over rare earth mining and smelting separation, including products obtained through mining, imports, and processing of other minerals (e.g., monazite concentrates).  \n4. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), in coordination with the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), oversees national quota management. Local governments above the county level are responsible for implementing these controls within their jurisdictions.  \n5. MIIT, MNR, and NDRC set annual quota targets based on national economic goals, resource reserves, industry development, ecological protection, and market demand. These are submitted to the State Council for approval.  \n6. MIIT and the Ministry of Natural Resources allocate quotas to rare earth producers based on production capacity, technical level, and environmental and safety standards. These quotas are communicated to provincial and local authorities.  \n7. Rare earth production enterprises must strictly comply with laws, administrative regulations, and relevant national provisions, and engage in rare earth mining and smelting separation within the scope of the total quantity control indicators. Only enterprises designated by MIIT and the Ministry of Natural Resources may engage in rare earth mining and smelting separation. Other organizations or individuals are prohibited from engaging in these activities.  \n8. Rare earth production enterprises shall be responsible for the implementation status of their enterprise's total quantity control indicators.",

In addition, over the medium to longer term, there are a number of proposed projects globally that may add to global supply if successful. Our base case view is many projects will struggle given the technical challenges in processing rare earths.- On the demand side, any deterioration in the outlook for EV penetration rates on wind installations will slow the recovery in rare earth prices.",
