In addition to robust earnings in the Cardiac and Vascular Company, Terumo has potential new earnings drivers, including the CDMO (alliance) business for pharmaceuticals companies in the Medical Care Solutions unit and the plasma collection platform business in the Blood and Cell Technologies Company. That said, we believe the stock is fairly priced at present and think a re- rating will need sales and profit to grow well above the Medtech sector average, which would likely require new growth drivers and business development. Looking ahead, our focus is on (1) whether earnings growth accelerates over the longer term on new growth drivers (neurovascular products in the Cardiac and Vascular Company, the alliance business in Medical Care Solutions, and collaborations in plasma collection in the Blood and Cell Technologies Company), and (2) the possibility of growth accelerating through business development, including acquisitions.",
