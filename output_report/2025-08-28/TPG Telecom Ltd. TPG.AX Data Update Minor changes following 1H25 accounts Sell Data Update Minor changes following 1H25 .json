The key incremental operational information relates to: (1) Composition of prepaid subscriber growth, noting +56k digital-first subs vs. +30k prepaid (noting c.\\$25 ARPU and c.90- 100% incremental margins); (2) Re- iteration of the strong cash- flow outlook to FY27, with capex stepping down from \\$790mn / \\$750mn / \\$550- 650mn in FY25/6/7E; and (3) Disclosure around fixed subscriber trends and AMPU assumptions. Factoring these reported estimates into our assumptions has driven immaterial changes to our operational outlook (minor re- allocations), but with more significant material D&A/interest changes reflecting new & updated commentary today.

We are Sell rated on TPG, given its risk/reward profile is skewed to the downside. Despite improved mobile market rationality in Australia, we see downside risks of continued enterprise headwinds, elevated fixed competition and higher cost growth for TPG over the medium term. We remain cautious on the upside for Fixed Wireless growth to offset NBN fixed declines into the medium term. Key upside risks: (1) successful execution on the transformation program; (2) upside from the proposed MOCN agreement with Optus; (3) stronger than expected penetration in fixed wireless; and (4) stronger than expected mobile pricing growth.",
