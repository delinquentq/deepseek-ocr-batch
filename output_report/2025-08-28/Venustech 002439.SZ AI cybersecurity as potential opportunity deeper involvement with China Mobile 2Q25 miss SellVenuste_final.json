We derive our target PE multiple from Chinese cybersecurity peers' low- end average ratio of 2026E P/E to forward year fundamentals: NI YoY growth and OPM in 2027E, which is 0.6x (vs. 0.4x previously). We use the low- end average to reflect Venustech's concentration in a single customer, China Mobile, and higher exposure to government spending. With Venustech's 34% NI YoY and 14% OPM in 2027E (vs. 47% NI YoY and 15% OPM in 2027E in our previous estimates), we derive a 2026E target PE multiple at 30.1x (vs. 25.8x in our previous target price implied 2026E PE). The higher ratio of 2026E P/E to forward year fundamentals (from 0.4x to 0.6x) reflects market re- rating on generative AI, which expands software products, encourages clients spending, and enhance software companies' operation efficiency. Our new target price is Rmb14.2 (vs. Rmb14.3 previously) based on 2026E EPS of 0.47 (vs. 0.55 previously). We maintain our Sell rating on the company.",
