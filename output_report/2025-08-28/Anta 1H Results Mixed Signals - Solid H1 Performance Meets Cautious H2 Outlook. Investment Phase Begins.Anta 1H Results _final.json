While the first half showed impressive double- digit revenue growth and stable underlying profitability, the outlook for Q3 and 2H appears challenging. Management has acknowledged deteriorating retail conditions in July and August, and downgraded ANTA brand growth expectations for the second half. The company is clearly in an investment phase across multiple fronts – integrating the loss- making Jack Wolfskin acquisition, expanding new store formats, building emerging brands like Maia Active, and accelerating international expansion. These initiatives, while strategically sound for the long- term, will likely pressure both topline growth and margins in the near term, and when valuations have risen to from 14.5x to 18x due to Amer's outperformance.",
