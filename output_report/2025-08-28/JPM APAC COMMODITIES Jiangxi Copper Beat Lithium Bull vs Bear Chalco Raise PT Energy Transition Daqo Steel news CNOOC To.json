Whilst the risk of lithium suspension is not resolved (given its a clay license from earlier, not full lithium), the equities sold off. Bears argue this sets up the mines to gradually come back in 3 months; and any lack of newsflow will see the lithium prices fall back given producer lock ins - the bulls were louder: arguing that conversion of porcelain to a full lithium license could take upto a year, and september \\(30^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) (miners submit reserve docs) is the beginning not the end of the uncertainty. We'd highlight shorts on the lithium space haven't quite gone away - Tianqi & Ganfeng at \\(15 - 17\\%\\) of FF shorted, so whilst the medium term outlook is still fairly negative with a large surplus, the stocks could continue to run into next month.",

Management has also raised its capex guidance to Rmb20bn for the next few years and will focus on securing overseas bauxite resources. We are positive on Chalco's growth outlook as it strengthens its integrated aluminum supply chain after China reaching the 45mt aluminum capacity cap.- Avery revises up FY25-27 earnings forecasts by \\(5 - 7\\%\\) to reflect the positive aluminum price outlook. Our revised Chalco-A PT of Rmb10 implies FY26E P/B of 2x and P/E of 12x. Our Chalco-H PT of HK\\(8 is based on a 26\\%\\) average 3-month A/H premium. Maintain OW",

Daqo announced Usd 100mn share repurchase program on August 26 2025, on the back of a promising outlook into 2H25.- We believe there is a chance that Daqo Cayman may dispose some of its shares in Xinjiang Daqo and use the proceeds to buy back its own shares, which may narrow the valuation gap and enhance the controlling rights of Daqo Cayman's shareholders to Xinjiang Daqo.
