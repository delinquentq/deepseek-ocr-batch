As expected, revenue continued to decline y/y in 2Q; coming in at - \\(4.3\\%\\) in cc terms. This continues to be driven by NORAM (- 29.7% y/y); however, all other geographies also continued to see negative growth, except for APAC which was up +11.2%. While new leadership is already in place in NORAM and turnaround measures to resolve the GTM issues are being implemented, management have taken a more prudent view on the outlook for 2H. Citing risks around a successful turnaround as well as current macro- uncertainty, management no longer expect a steep 2H acceleration back to double digit growth (as implied under the previous 2- \\(4\\%\\) guidance range). Now, on a- combined LfL basis with Crayon, growth is expected by be flat in cc terms in 2025 (vs. - 3.1% delivered by the combined company in 1H25). We think this implies a return to low- to- mid single digit y/y growth in 2H (both for SoftwareOne standard one and the combined company), which we think is more aligned with current consensus expectations for SoftwareOne, but likely significantly below expectations for Crayon (which guided to 15 to 20% gross profit growth in FY25). We see further room for disappointment on the adj. EBITDA margin guidance, which is now expected to be above 20% on a combined basis (i.e. stable vs. the 20% in 2024 on a combined basis). We estimate that this is \\(\\sim 3\\) pps lower than what was implied by the combined previous standalone guidance ranges provided by both SoftwareOne and Crayon. Overall despite an in- line 2Q, we think the lowered FY25 guidance will be a negative for the shares today (we note that the company will provide guidance for FY26 as well as a mid- term targets with their FY25 results). We see the shares down mid to high single digit % today.",
