Gap and Old Navy drove healthy results in the quarter, both delivering positive comps \\((+4\\%\\) and \\(+2\\%\\) , respectively; though we note each brand decelerated vs. slightly vs. 1Q), while Banana Republic saw sequential acceleration to a \\(+4\\%\\) comp (vs. flat in 1Q). Management also noted sequential improvement in the 2H of the quarter, with July accelerating and trends continuing into August as a result of strong engagement with fall product in the back- to- school season. Offsetting this, Athleta decelerated (comps \\(- 9\\%\\) Y/Y despite easier compares) and drove a surprising gross margin miss for the consolidated entity (2Q GPM - 130bps vs. FactSet consensus - 60bps). This GPM miss was offset by solid SG&A cost control, although this was also driven by a timing shift.",

      "text": "Differing Levels of Service provided by Global Investment Research: The level and types of services provided to you by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research may vary as compared to that provided to internal and other external clients of GS, depending on various factors including your individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communication, your risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g., marketwide, sector specific, long term, short term), the size and scope of your overall client relationship with GS, and legal and regulatory constraints. As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
