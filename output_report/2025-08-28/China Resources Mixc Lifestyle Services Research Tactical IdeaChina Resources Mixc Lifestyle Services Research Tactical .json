We believe the market is overly concerned about CR Mixc's cash collection given: 1) current- period collection rate improved across segments; and 2) CEO is confident of achieving \\(\\sim 1x\\) OCF/NP ratio for the full year by taking proactive collection measures. Together with its rich cash balance ( \\(\\sim\\) Rmb18bn in 1H, equivalent to \\(\\sim 4.5x\\) of our 2025e profit), we think Mixc can keep the \\(100\\%\\) payout (reaffirmed by management) to offer \\(5 - 6\\%\\) yield in 2025- 27. Also, with its mall alpha to sustain, robust growth of urban space segment and margin expansion on operating leverage, Mixc would likely deliver stronger earnings than management's cautious guidance of double- digit \\(\\%\\) y- y in 2025. Combining with better earnings quality and enlarging contribution from commercial segment, we think Mixc should justify \\(\\sim 20x\\) P/E.",
