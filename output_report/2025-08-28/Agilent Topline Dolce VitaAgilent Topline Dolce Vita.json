      "text": "The setup for Agilent coming into the Q was skewed positive, with a topline beat expected, following strong prints from the rest of the group. In addition, Agilent's exposure to stronger markets, NASD read- throughs from ALNY drug volumes and approvals, and the fact that they are earlier in the LC/MS replacement cycle than WAT contributed to the narrative. Even then, topline exceeded those heightened expectations, especially in Crosslab and AMG. Notably, the CAM end market was strong (+10%) as a GC instrument replacement cycle seemed to begin/meaningfully accelerate and semi fab build- outs continued. This replacement cycle for GC- MS (~20% of the biz) has a longer conversion rate, so we can expect this to be a more drawn out TW for the company vs. the 5- 7 year cycle we see now for LC- MS. The GC- MS replacement cycle is likely being treated as a one- timer by investors following the print since it did not appear to be well understood going into the Q and there was little commentary on the durability of this cycle, so it will likely be a show me- story in the next few Qs. On LC/MS, ProIQ and Infinity 3 innovation continue to drive the replacement cycle with LDD growth in both LC and LC/MS.",

Digging deeper into the margin dynamics, 1/3 of the margin HW in the Q came from tariff- related costs that were \\(\\sim\\) 355M, 510M greater than the \\(\\) 25M\\(guide going into the quarter due to stronger revenues, 1/3 came from variable pay increases due to performance another 1/3 coming from incremental commercial investments. We understand that tariff and additional commercial investments were unforeseen by mgmt. going into the Q in fact we see higher tariffs due to revenue outperformance as a positive and additional investment in the commercial organization as a vote of confidence in the durability of strength in the end markets. There is also push back on 4Q margins that mgmt expect to increase 230bps sequentially through additional Ignite cost actions, fx settling down, but primarily on volume leverage on the CDMO side of the business. Ultimately, margins will likely be a show- me story given the number of moving pieces and how underappreciated the NASD/CDMO margin dynamic is.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
