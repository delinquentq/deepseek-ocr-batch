AMD argues that new demand signals for customers are encouraging but take 9-12 months to convert into revenues given GPU order and manufacturing cycles. Separately, AMD noted that CSPs look at supplier roadmaps multiple years in the future, and given that AMD has only been shipping its MI300 family for less than 2 years, and that its portfolio as improved materially, it believes that it is well positioned with CSPs in the future.- For MI400 Helios rack AMD is working closely with ZT Systems inputs and going through rigorous sub-component level prototyping, testing and debugging as the GPU will be the last component dropped into the system. AMD hopes this approach allows customers more upfront prep vs typical sampling and allows to make decision on system configurations upfront potentially speeding up deployment process in the future.- OpenAI models supported on AMD from Day 1 – could not have said this months ago- AMD needs to apply for licenses for MI308 for each customer and received first couple of licenses after earnings. At the time of write-off it had minimal MI308 finished good inventories, some WIP inventories and supply purchase commitments. It requires at least 6-8 weeks to finish WIP inventories so the earliest potential MI308 revs contribution is in 4Q25.- AMD expects demand in China given local AI chips supply is insufficient to fill all local demand.- AMD views Granite Rapids as narrowing the gap to Turin, but expects Venice CPU - the first non-cellphone chip on 2nm TSMC process - to widen the gap vs INTC again.- AMD has a high share in \\(1^{\\text{st}}\\) party cloud workloads, but expects to grow share in \\(3^{\\text{rd}}\\) party and enterprise server market. Recent OpEx increases are related to AMD's go-to-market strategy for enterprise server market. AMD views agentic AI driving enterprise demand for higher-end server CPUs- ARM CPUs are largely used for internal workloads. AMD argues it has ARM licenses (for FPGA business) and if all customer demand was heading to ARM CPUs AMD could make one, but it continued to see customer demand for x86 ecosystem- Client CPUs: AMD estimates its share at 20% in enterprise notebooks and expects to gain more share with Dell ramp in 4Q25.
