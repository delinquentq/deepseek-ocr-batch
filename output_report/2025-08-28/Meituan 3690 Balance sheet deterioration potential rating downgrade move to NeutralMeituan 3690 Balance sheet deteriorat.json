We expect the company to turn loss- making along with a deterioration in credit profile in 2025E/26E, as a result of (1) potential market share loss to Alibaba due to the latter's strong commitment to expand in the China food delivery/quick commerce market, and (2) an extended offering of aggressive subsidies. MEITUA is currently rated Baa1/A-/BBB+ (M/S/F) with a stable/stable/positive outlook, and we see rating downgrade risks if its competitive position is structurally weakened, or if leverage ratios sustain at elevated levels. We move MEITUA \\(\\cdot 29\\%\\) (4.5% ytm, SOT+78) and \\(\\cdot 30\\%\\) (4.5% ytm, SOT+84) from OW to Neutral, as we expect credit spreads to widen near term to reflect a cloudier financial outlook and potential downgrade by rating agencies. In the single- A TMT space, we prefer TENCNT \\(\\cdot 38s\\) (SOT+62) and \\(\\cdot 50s\\) (SOT+52), due to (1) Tencent's disciplined investment strategy and solid financial outlook, and (2) the credits' relatively wide pick- up vs the front end.",

Management expects competition to remain fierce in the near term, and anticipates core local commerce to record a significant loss in 3Q. A positive note in the 2Q print is that despite a revenue slowdown and an \\(81\\% /89\\%\\) yoy drop in group EBITDA/net profit, operating cashflow remained positive at +Rmb5bn.

      "text": "- Net loss and credit profile deterioration in 2025E/26E: J.P. Morgan China Internet analyst Alex Yao expects a deterioration in long-term market share outlook and margin structure for Meituan (link), as a result of Alibaba's stronger-than-expected commitment to expand in the food delivery market. He believes the China food delivery industry is significantly in favor of the volume leader due to better economies of scale, and a decline in the incumbent's market share by volume could lead to a disproportionately higher market share loss by profit. The team expects Meituan will book a net loss of Rmb7bn/5bn in 2025E/26E, due to (1) market share loss, (2) an extended offering of heavy subsidies. We estimate that this implies: (1) FCF will reverse from +Rmb47bn in 2024 to -Rmb2bn in 2025E and 2026E, and (2) net cash will decline from Rmb132bn in 2024 to Rmb130bn/128bn in 2025E/26E. Meituan's credit profile will likely deteriorate, with total debt to EBITDA widening from 1x in 2024 to 20x in 2026E, as EBITDA may contract 94% from Rmb48.5bn in 2024 to Rmb2.9bn in 2026E.",

      "text": "J.P. Morgan uses a bond-level rating system that incorporates valuations (relative value) and our fundamental view on the security. Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability,capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).",
