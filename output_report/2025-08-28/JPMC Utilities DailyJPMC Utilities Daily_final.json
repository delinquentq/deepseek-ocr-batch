Our initial read of this investigation is that it is related to historical disclosures rather than an investigation into biomass sustainability itself - a similar topic to the 2023 Ofgem investigation. Our initial take is that this investigation should not impact Drax's existing subsidies nor the bridging mechanism, especially given the latter is being done for security of supply reasons, and we look forward to seeing more detail from the FCA as well as the government response to this investigation.

Offshore wind has been in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, whose administration has taken several steps to halt or prevent construction of projects off the US coast. \"We have pulled the plug,\" Krebber said with regard to Community Offshore Wind, reiterating earlier comments that the construction on the project had not yet started. Krebber said he therefore saw no need to write down the project, which has a book value of €800mn. He said that if",

The move follows a restructuring of its collaboration with Singapore- based wind power developer The Blue Circle, in which Acciona Energia is a shareholder. Under the new arrangement, Acciona Energia will manage its portfolio in the three markets, while The Blue Circle will focus independently on Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Cambodia. The Spanish renewables company said the reorganisation strengthens its position in Asia- Pacific, a key growth region, and consolidates its presence in the Philippines, where it has wind and solar projects at various stages of operation, construction and development. It said it plans to accelerate expansion in the country in the coming years. The Blue Circle, which has focused on developing wind projects in Southeast Asia, will continue to operate independently across its target markets. Acciona Energia said the new structure aligns with its global growth strategy and supports its aim of driving the energy transition in emerging markets. Three years ago, Acciona Energia invested \\(34mn (EUR 29.3mn)\\) to take a close to \\(50\\%\\) stake in The Blue Circle and committed an additional \\(113.5mn\\) to finance its mature projects.",
