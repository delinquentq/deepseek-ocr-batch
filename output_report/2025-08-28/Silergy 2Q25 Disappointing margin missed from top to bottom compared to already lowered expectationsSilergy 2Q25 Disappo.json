An additional downside surprise on these earnings is that GPM dropped to 51.5%, tracking way behind cons. 54% and our estimates 53.8%. It is a very poor print compared to already lowered expectations post 1Q25 earnings, and we expect the stock to react negatively tomorrow. We need more clarification from the earnings call to verify our thesis, but the print is clearly disappointing.",
