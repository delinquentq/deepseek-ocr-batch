Delivery continued its strong run with c25% YoY growth (despite impact of free delivery coming in the base) which stayed much ahead of the platforms like Zomato &amp;amp; Swiggy. Dine-in growth improved QoQ to +2.5% YoY (20%+ ex-takeaway), and mgmt expects the segment to see further improvement going forward. Mgmt feels that the food aggregators are complementary to their own assets and will continue to actively collaborate with them. Mgmt expects the drag on profitability from other brands (Dunkin&#x27;, Hong&#x27;s, Popeyes) will halve over the next couple of years, and hence will aid in improving the margin profile. Mgmt focus continues to remain on driving growth.Devyani InternationalWeak performance in 1Q as SSS declined across key brands KFC (-0.7%) and Pizza Hut (-4.2%) despite a low base. Management noted that in KFC, online (via food delivery platforms) SSSG was positive. Mgmt expects to see positive SSSG in KFC over the next few qtrs. Focus on Pizza hut scale is expected to go down. Near-term macro factors have led to soft consumer demand, but mgmt. expects the SSSG to come back once consumption starts to pick up. On the acquisition portfolio, the initial focus will be to turn the brand contribution positive in the next 12 months, after which it will work towards ramping it.Sapphire FoodsFor KFC, SSSG remained flat however, transaction growth (SSSTG) has turned LSD positive. Pizza Hut SSSG slipped back to negative territory at -8% in 1Q. Sri Lanka did well with DD growth in SSSG (+12% LKR) and SSTG. There is a DD difference in SSSG between Tamil Nadu performance and the rest of the market in Pizza Hut; Tamil Nadu delivered LSD positive SSSG.Restaurant Brands Asia (India business)SSSG came in at 2.6%, declining sequentially. The demand environment has been tighter than usual, with the premium end seeing low demand; however, lower-end demand continues to be strong. Mgmt. expects 3Q to see improvements in demand with positive tailwinds in the premium segment. Company is focusing on driving footfalls in its stores and improving profitability of the delivery business.Westlife FoodworldSSSG came in at +0.5% YoY, led by order volume primarily due to higher value offerings. The demand environment continues to be soft; however, the company expects eating out to pick up gradually in FY26, supported by lower inflation and government stimulus. Mgmt highlighted slower traction in South versus West.Barbeque NationIndia SSSG came in at -5.2%, impacted by a softer dine-in cycle. However, the delivery segment (15% salience) continues to see positive SSSG. The South India market is dragging the growth, as the company is seeing stress in outlets that are heavily dependent on IT businesses. July has not seen any improvement in performance and continues to be similar to 1Q. Removal of 5% service charge has led to a negative impact of -0.5% on gross margin and overall sales realization. Mgmt. maintained its store network target of 300-325 restaurants by FY27.ZomatoFood GOV grew 16% YoY, but increased restaurant-funded discounts drove 13% growth in NOV. Food delivery FY26 growth is likely to stay lower than the guidance of 20%, but over 15%. Q/c has been a headwind to food delivery growth, but in the long term, food delivery shall continue to grow at 20%. Mgmt didn&#x27;t mention any impact from GLP-1 drugs on FP consumption and mentioned it is too early to judge the potential impacts. Blinkit is moving fully to a 1P model over the next three quarters. This will raise working capital by 18 days, but mgmt. sees no concern given the 100bps margin boost and &amp;gt;40% ROCE potential. This should weigh on Hyperpure revenues, which will decline, given the business acted as a back end for Blinkit.Swiggy1Q growth in food delivery was strong while momentum continued in Q/C, with smart AOV expansion. However, EBITDA margins came-off in both (QoQ) which mgmt attributed to factors like higher payouts to riders, revision in staff comp, etc. Mgmt mentioned that food delivery growth remains strong and margins should normalise over the year. Q/C contribution loss should reduce (break-even in 2-4 qtrs) but decline in adj. EBITDA loss may be more gradual due to competition. Mgmt is not averse to a shift to 1P where margins could be up to 70bps higher.",

Customer entry in April was flat, but the progress in May and June was good. ATV has been increasing consistently with 6% growth in 1Q.

Beauty GMV growth (incl. eB2B), remained strong at 25% YoY, led by a strong growth in transacting users. Fashion GMV picked up sequentially to 25% YoY; the NSV growth was slower implying higher discounting. Mgmt sounded positive on its house of brands strategy, with Dot & Key GMV at Rs15bn. In beauty, the company is benefiting from investment in customer acquisitions made in previous qtrs. In fashion, the focus is on building brands through its own marketplace, while the inventory-led model remains largely restricted to own-labels.HonasaGrowth slowed down sequentially to 7% YoY - this was due to unseasonal rains which impacted its summer portfolio (sunscreen). Mgmt. noted c200bps impact on revenue due to seasonality issue. Interestingly, UVG was higher at 10.5% - the gap was partially due to change in channel mix. The growth was led by younger brands, which grew 20% YoY even while Mamaearth portfolio continued to see an improvement. Mgmt expects Mamaearth brand to return to growth by end-FY26.

The company experienced mix deterioration, with the share of high-margin general merchandise and apparel falling to approximately 24.7% of revenue, while the FMCG segment&#x27;s contribution increased.

Overall demand environment has seen a gradual improvement aided by lower inflation, above average monsoon forecasts, etc. Urban has started to pickup, but rural continued to outgrow. HUL expects H1FY26 growth to be better than 2H1FY25, aided by portfolio transformation and improving macro. Focus will be on driving volume-led growth.GM contracted &amp;gt;220bps YoY due to input cost inflation, with 120bps EBITDA margin contraction. GM is expected to improve QoQ, by reducing pricing &amp;gt; cost gap and improving mix. HUL will reinvest savings to drive growth and guidance stays at 22-23% EBITDA margin, around 1ppt lower than the past. Tea prices were reset inline with the input cost deflation, in order to stay competitive even while consumption cost was higher than spot.ITCCig volumes grew +6% in 1Q, with early signs of urban demand recovery in 1Q. Expectation of a normal monsoon and better trends in hair growth could also be positive for rural demand. Lower inflation, tax cuts, interest rates reduction is expected to aid in growth. HMCG grew 5% YoY, due to continued pressure in notebooks portfolio (ex-notebooks, FMCG grew 5% YoY) because of high competition and lower realizations. Paperboards continue to see muted perf. due to impact of subdued realizations, influx of low-priced supplies in India and surge in domestic wood prices.Margin contracted across segments. Commodity prices continued to remain inflated across several key inputs (viz. edible oil, wheat, maize, cocoa etc.) during 1Q. Consumption of high cost leaf tobacco &amp;gt; other inputs, largely mitigated through improved mix and strategic cost management &amp;gt; calibrated pricing.NestléDomestic volume + mix growth improved sequentially to c.3% YoY in 1Q. Three out of its four product categories performed well, per mgmt. with DD growth in beverages and confectionary, mainly price-led, in our view.GM contracted 250bps YoY to 55%, due to elevated commodity prices. Opex were also high due to mgf. expansion over the past few qtrs. Ebitda, remained flat YoY. Coffee prices are expected to remain range-bound while cocoa and edible oil have stabilized. Milk prices may line with a favorable monsoon and flush season.BritanniaMgmt highlighted an uptick in FMCG demand across both urban and rural markets and witnessed DD growth in rural and HSD growth in urban markets. Britannia&#x27;s overall market share was flattish, but the company has outpaced peers, per mgmt. Some market share was lost in the East to local competition, due to execution issues because of an ongoing distribution restructuring.GM contracted &amp;lt;260bps YoY to 39.2% due to continued cost inflation, esp. in palm oil (+45% YoY) and wheat flour (+8% YoY), despite a sequential moderation. Other inputs (sugar, cocoa &amp;gt; laminates) also saw YoY pressure. The company does not intend to take any further pricing actions. Palm oil duty cuts partly benefited 1Q, with more impact expected in 2Q. Mgmt expects input costs to stabilize going aheadGCPLMgmt highlighted better consumption in 1Q vs 4Q. The company expects the perf. to improve gradually through FY26, with H2 better than H1. Vol. grew 5% YoY, despite a sharp decline in soaps due to grammage cuts and unseasonal rains, however pack growth in soaps was in DD. HI grew HSD volumes, with market share gains in electrical as well as at the entire category level, a first in a decade. Indonesia had a weak performance in 1Q with flat volumes YoY, while value (c/c) declined by 4% due to macro issues.India EBITDA margin declined &amp;gt;3ppt YoY due to &amp;gt;5ppt decline in GMs due to severe pressures in soaps - high-cost inventory of palm oil. Mgmt. noted margin pressure in soaps shall continue in 2Q as well and the benefit of lower palm oil should be visible in 2H. The company also took some product price cuts in HI and hair colour portfolio, which too had slight impact on margins. Standalone Ebitda margins in 1H will be below the normative range, but H2 should see some improvements.DaburSeasonal portfolio (glucose &amp;gt; beverages) declined in DD impacted by rains, which impacted overall performance - ex of this, revenues grew 7% YoY. Urban markets witnessed QoQ recovery, but rural demand continued to outgrow urban. Mgmt expects sequential demand recovery on the back of improving macro, tax cuts, softening food inflation, and a positive monsoon forecast. Mgmt. expects a DD top-line growth in the coming qtrs. also aided by a low base. The company guided for single-digit top-line growth for FY26 with improving Ebitda margins.GM contracted by c75bps YoY, despite taking 3-4% product price hikes. However, Ebitda margin (excl. legal costs) was flat YoY (in-line) due to lower A&amp;gt;P (-14% YoY). Mgmt expects inflation to be around 8% going ahead, but expects to mitigate its impact via product price hikes along with cost savings.Tata ConsumerRevenue grew 10% with UVG of c7%. Packaged beverages reported price-led (in tea) revenue growth of 12% YoY with 1% vol growth. NourishCo reported 13% YoY revenue decline due to unseasonal weather and ongoing competition. Foods revenue growth (organic) came in strong at 16%, with volumes up 6% while reported growth (incl M&A) was 14% YoY. Sales business grew 13% on back of mid-single-digit vol. growth. Unbranded business performance was heavily impacted due to moderating coffee prices. Guidance of MSD volume growth in tea and salt continues.EBITDA margin contracted 270bps YoY, due to significant cost inflation in tea, resulting in EBITDA decline of 8% YoY. Unbranded business Ebitda margins contracted by 7ppt. International EBITDA margins contracted ~270bps due to lower GM and higher opex. Mgmt. expects tea prices to soften going forward led by better tea crop YoY, which would aid margins.MaricoIndia value/volume growth was at a 16-qtr high. Volume growth at 9% is impressive and was despite decline in Parachute. International c/c growth was also strong. Marico witnessed stable to improving demand trends across urban and rural, with premium outperforming mass segment. The company expects a gradual recovery in demand aided by easing inflation, favourable monsoon, and govt. policy support.GM contracted &amp;gt;5 ppt YoY due to high input cost inflation (copa &amp;gt; vegetable oil), which was partially offset by price hikes. This along with higher A&amp;gt;P (+25% YoY) led to EBITDA margin contraction (~350bps YoY). Copa remained inflated in 1Q (100%+ YoY), while edible oil prices saw moderation. Mgmt does not intend to take further product price hikes in Parachute, as copra prices are expected to cool off going ahead.ColgateMgmt. highlighted that the performance was affected by subdued urban demand and continued heightened competitive intensity in the industry. Mgmt. also attributed some of the impact to a high base in previous years. The premiumisation trend continued, led by the new launches, in our view. Mgmt. is expecting a gradual recovery in 2H1FY26.Gross margins contracted &amp;gt;175bps YoY/QoQ, to 68.6%. Ad-spends declined by 5% YoY in absolute terms, but remained broadly similar as a percentage of revenues (-14bps YoY). EBITDA margin contracted &amp;gt;2.4ppts YoY/QoQ, to 31.6%, due to GM contraction and negative operating leverage, which was also lower than our estimate.VBLIndia was impacted by the rains, which led to a volume decline of c.7% YoY - one of the worst in many qtrs. Unit realisation was also down c.2%, due to higher salience of water and small packs performing better than larger packs. Int’l revenues grew &amp;gt;20% YoY, with c.15% volumes. South Africa volumes grew 16% YoY. VBL is actively looking for expansion (incl M&A) in international markets.Consol. GMs remained flat YoY to 54.5%, aided by balanced product mix and cost improvements. Despite a decline in volumes, Ebitda margins improved by &amp;gt;80bps YoY to 28.5% (higher than JFE), due to cost controls in India and strong margin expansion in international business. Mgmt. expects cost control benefits to continue to flow and expects India margins to sustain, despite increased competition.EmamiUn-seasonal rains and short summer impacted Emami&#x27;s summer portfolio, as a result overall 1Q volumes declined by 3%. 1Q continued to witness pressure on urban discretionary consumption, while rural demand showed signs of recovery. Mgmt. expects the macro environment to gradually improve aided by lower inflation and above-average monsoon.GM expanded by 170bps to 69.4% led by benign input costs and product price hikes. However, Ebitda margins remained flat YoY due to higher opex. Mgmt has guided that A&amp;gt;P spends as a % of sales in FY26 will be similar to FY25. Mgmt also expects stable input costs in the near future.",
