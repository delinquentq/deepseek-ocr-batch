Today Implats is reporting HEPS of RO.85/share marginally above the mid- point of the guidance range per the trading statement. At first look the delta to our original estimates does appear to have been driven by the adverse impact of lower sales volumes and higher unit costs (as expected) coupled with a high effective tax rate \\((53\\%)\\) . Implats have declared a final dividend of R1.65/ share (R1.5bn) ahead of both MSE RO.99/share and company compiled consensus median of RO.50/share. After including dividends paid to Impala Chrome minorities this equates to \\(\\sim 60\\%\\) of FY25 adjusted FCF (policy minimum \\(30\\%\\) of FCF). The payout appears to be premised on both the robust balance sheet position (R8.1bn net cash on had) and improving market conditions.",
