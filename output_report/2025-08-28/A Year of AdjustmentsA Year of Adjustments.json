In the context of the size of Softcat, it would be hard to argue that a £1- 2m deal is unusually large. As a result, we assume the majority of this £7m comes from one client, leading the company to view it as unusually large. Based on our recollection, Softcat last called out a large customer contribution in FY22, when one customer accounted for \\(10\\%\\) of GII. This highlights the unpredictable nature of larger deals and the challenge in knowing how to extrapolate this going forward.",
