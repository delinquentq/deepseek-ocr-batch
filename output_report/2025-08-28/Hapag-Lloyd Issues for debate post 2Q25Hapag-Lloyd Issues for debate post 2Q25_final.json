After recent news around an extension of the US- China 90- day pause, management saw bookings pick up on the China to US trade lane. We see this as another moving part to a very volatile year, which may provide some upside to volumes and potentially rates in 3Q. However, it remains to be seen how long this mini- pick up can last, as we also question where inventory levels in the US sit following the early peak in May/June. Management commented that it expects front- loading and higher permanent tariffs could slow down demand in 2H25, and we remain cautious on how 2H25 volumes will develop if a weaker US consumer and destocking trends start to materialise. We also continue to view the mid- term oversupply issue in the industry as unavoidable, as there is no historical evidence of the industry being disciplined with scrapping capacity, and, assuming the Red Sea reopens, the demand/supply balance should return back to 4Q23 levels – which points to low rates and risky profitability for the industry.",

The stock is currently trading at 7x EV/EBITDA in FY25e and 10x in FY26e, with the latter significantly above its historical average. Although the new Gemini network should support a more robust volume outlook, given greater network efficiency boosts asset utilisation, we continue to see downside risk to FY26/27 Bloomberg consensus, while FY26 will depend on timing of Red Sea re- opening and geopolitical variables. We look for signs of industry structural repair to emerge to turn more constructive on the overall sector, focusing on scrapping picking up as charters roll off in 2025, the orderbook being consistently depleted and idling increasing.",

HLAG still targets a \\(20\\%\\) cost reduction vs. the 2022 Covid peak by 2030, but this would equate to \\(10\\%\\) above pre- Covid cost levels. Management expects to start to see impacts of the cost saving program come through gradually in 2H. Approximately \\(50\\%\\) of this cost savings target will come from synergy and efficiency gains from the Gemini cooperation. When should we expect to see the full runrate of Gemini- related savings? Has the Gemini transition incurred more costs than expected in 1H? What are the main initiatives underpinning the program? Is it dependent on a macro recovery? How will new vessel deliveries contribute to unit cost reductions? How much incremental cost does management expect in terms of EU ETS costs alone for FY25?

Management remains unworried by the new wave of orders as an issue, given the ageing global fleet as well as the environmental regulations that are being introduced, which will require carriers to sail slower in future. Management still expects significant scrapping even between now and the end of FY27, as there is an increasing number of ships \\(>25\\) years. When should we see scrapping start to pick up? How much scrapping capacity is there p.a.? Does the recently implemented Hong Kong convention reduce scrapping capacity? How long is the waiting list for scrapping and do shipping lines have to plan in advance? Pre 3Q24, HLAG announced the order of 24 LNG vessels planned for delivery in 2027- 29, of which \\(12 \\times 16.8k\\) TEU will be used to expand capacity, and another \\(12 \\times 9.2k\\) TEU vessels are planned to replace capacity. Are there any plans to scrap older vessels before the 12 new ones are delivered? How can the industry avoid oversupply putting further pressure on freight rates? Is management concerned that industry structural repair will now be delayed and the oversupply situation may actually worsen in the event of a sudden Red Sea resolution? When the Red Sea re- opens, how much capacity can be absorbed by slow steaming? Is environmental regulation homogeneous enough across regions to drive harmonised behaviour? Can shippers demanding green transportation drive scrapping?",

The move also provides some protection against spot rate fluctuations; however, HLAG commented that it is still vulnerable if spot rates fall too much. Can management elaborate on the trends seen in the Transpacific contract negotiations (HLAG is \\(70 / 30\\%\\) contract/spot on Transpacific) in terms of shippers' willingness to sign contracts earlier or later, and what are the main areas of contention during these discussions?

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
