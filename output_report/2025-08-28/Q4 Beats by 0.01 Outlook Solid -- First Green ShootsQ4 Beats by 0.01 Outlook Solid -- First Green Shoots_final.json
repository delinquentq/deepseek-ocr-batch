On-road demand remains soft, but off-road, particularly in agriculture, has shown signs of improvement. We estimate market share gains will likely add 100-200bps of volume growth in 2026. In Aftermarket, the comps are more challenging, but share gains and replacement demand likely support 100-300bps of volume growth. IFS first-fit demand in Europe and North America also likely trends higher, offsetting softness in Latin America and Asia. Replacement parts should provide 200-300bps of volume growth in Industrials, while A&D will likely be flat as several projects end and off tough comps. A meaningful improvement in bio-processing is unlikely in 2026,but F&B (1/3rd of segment sales) and disk drive sales are expected to support 1-5% sales growth.Pricing is likely to be a 1% sales tailwind for all segments.",

Cost cuts and the footprint optimization are expected to be mostly complete by the second half of 2026, but the tailwind from the productivity gains will likely be evident throughout the year. Mix improvements will also likely provide a margin tailwind, and incremental margins are pegged at 40% for the company.We estimate ~60bps of annual EBIT margin expansion will help support a 10% EPS CAGR from 2026-2028.",
