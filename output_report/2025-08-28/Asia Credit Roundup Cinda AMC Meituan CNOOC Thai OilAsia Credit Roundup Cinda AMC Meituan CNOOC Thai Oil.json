A large driver was a \\(65\\%\\) y/y increase in credit impairment losses to RMB7.9 billion. The company also recognized an RMB1.6 billion impairment on properties held for sale by Cinda Real Estate; this compares with a much more modest impairment of only RMB42 million in the year- ago period. The DAM business lost RMB6.2 billion on a pre- tax basis, compared to positive earnings of RMB749 million in 1H'24. The disappointing pre- tax figure for 1H'25 occurred despite stable y/y revenues as asset impairment provisions and the loss from unrealized fair value changes totaling - RMB14.8 billion, an RMB5.0 billion y/y increase. The Financial Services business continues to be the main profitability driver, contributing RMB3.5 billion in pre- tax profits, including RMB2.0 billion from Nanyang Commercial Bank, the largest portion of the Financial Services business. Capital ratios declined roughly 200bp in general, with the Core Tier 1 ratio falling from 16.07% in December to 9.66%; the total Capital Adequacy Ratio moved from 16.75% to 14.69%.

We expect the company to turn lossmaking along with a deterioration in credit profile in 2025E/26E, as a result of (1) potential market share loss to Alibaba due to the latter's strong commitment to expand in the China food delivery/quick commerce market, and (2) an extended offering of aggressive subsidies. MEITUA is currently rated Baa1/A- BBB+ (M/S/F) with a stable/stable/positive outlook, and we see rating downgrade risks if its competitive position is structurally weakened, or if leverage ratios sustain at elevated levels. We move MEITUA \\(29\\%\\) (4.5% ytm, \\(SOT + 78\\) ) and \\(30\\%\\) (4.5% ytm, \\(SOT + 84\\) ) from OW to Neutral, as we expect credit spreads to widen near term to reflect a cloudier financial outlook and potential downgrade by rating agencies.

Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).",
