Although results just missed consensus, the company explained that earnings exceeded plan, especially overseas. Overseas growth was driven by improved profitability at Milei (Germany) since 3Q last year, and structural reforms in the US also contributed. Domestically, the company had a tough start like its peers, but overseas operations, now accounting for over \\(30\\%\\) of total profit, have entered an expansion phase. In Japan, rising raw material costs are a headwind, but profit momentum will likely improve from 2Q due to price hikes in response to higher milk prices and operating rates at the new frozen dessert factory opened in Apr.",

We expect overseas to account for \\(\\sim 38\\%\\) of total OP. Notably, the Aug price of why protein, a key benchmark for Milei's pricing, is up 11% YoY, contrary to the firm's assumption of a sharp decline in 2H (Jul-Dec). Temporary stagnation impact from China's infant formula regulatory changes has also passed. We foresee sustained supply-demand tightness, driven by limited supply and growing global protein demand, supporting a continued price uptrend.",
