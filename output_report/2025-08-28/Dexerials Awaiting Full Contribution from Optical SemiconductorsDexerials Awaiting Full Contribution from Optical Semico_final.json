We adjust our FX assumption for F3/26 3Q onwards from ¥140/&#36; to ¥145/&#36;. Our profit forecasts for F3/26-28 are largely unchanged. In F3/26, we forecast BP to fall, but if excluding the impact from yen appreciation, we expect profit to remain high thanks to the earnings contribution from high added-value products featuring the firm's differentiated technology, such as particle-arrayed ACF.Earnings grew rapidly these past few years, but momentum is now lacking. Our F3/27 EPS estimate is unchanged, so we keep our PT at ¥2,200 (based on segmental P/Es; gives a F3/27e P/E of 15.5x). Dexerials' share price has underperformed TOPIX ~26ppt YTD, making it one of the worst performers (second worst) in our chemicals coverage. We put this down to it being a best performer in 2024, profit being forecast to fall in F3/26, and sales stagnating due to slow yield improvement in highly anticipated optical semiconductors. Shares do not look cheap or expensive at a P/E of ~14x vs F3/27e EPS, so we stay EW. We think the profit contribution from optical semiconductors will need to grow for the price to rise in earnest.",

      "text": "**Fine tuning F3/26-28 profit forecasts: F3/26 1Q BP beat our forecast by ¥900mn,**with Optical Materials & Components (OMC) greatly outperforming (strong sales of anti-reflection (AR) film for laptops, driven by greater-than-expected replacement demand), but Electronic Materials & Components (EMC) underperforming (shortfall in optical semiconductor sales and higher fixed costs). For the full-F3/26, we revise our BP forecast from ¥32bn to ¥32.5bn after lowering our forecast for EMC and raising our forecast for OMC to reflect 1Q results. Our BP forecast is for a 15% YoY fall as, while we expect sales volumes to increase for AR film for laptops and precision bonding results we assume yen appreciation (~¥4bn impact) and higher upfront costs (~¥4bn) will cause a 2-digit decline. Dexerials assumes an FX rate of ¥135/&#36; (BP guidance: ¥29bn), so we think guidance could be hiked at the time of 1H results. For F3/27, we assume FX rates will stay flat, and forecast BP to +5% to ¥34bn (unchanged) on growth in sales of automotive AR film and profit gains in optical semiconductors. In F3/28, we forecast BP +6% to ¥36bn (unchanged), driven by growth in sales of differentiated products. We estimate sales of optical semiconductors to Datacom (such as optical transceiver products for data centers) topped ¥1bn in F3/25, and we forecast this to grow to ~¥2bn in F3/26 and ~¥3.5bn in F3/27, but we expect the profit contribution to be negligible.",
