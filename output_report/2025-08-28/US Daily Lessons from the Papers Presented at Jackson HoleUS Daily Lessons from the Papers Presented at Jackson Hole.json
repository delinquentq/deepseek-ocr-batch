The paper shows that deviations from the Taylor Rule have occurred frequently since the 1990s but argues that this is not evidence of suboptimal monetary policy. Several reasons explain why central banks might choose to respond to inflation by less than implied by standard rules, including the \"long and variable lags\" of policy that imply central banks should not try to fully offset transitory shocks because rate hikes would affect the economy too slowly to counteract them anyway.",

Since the 1950s, demographic changes, increasing inequality, falling productivity growth, and strong foreign demand have all supported U.S. asset demand. Supply has picked up since the 1980s, driven by rising government debt, but demand dominated, putting downward pressure on interest rates.",

Surprisingly, their model suggests that population aging will boost asset demand enough by 2100 that interest rates would remain stable even if debt-to-GDP rose to 250%, but only if aggressive deficit-reduction policies are implemented. In her discussion of the paper, Karen Dynan noted that this conclusion critically depends on assuming a very low sensitivity of interest rates to debt increases. We have likewise assumed a slightly higher sensitivity in our recent work on fiscal sustainability, which would likely imply an unsustainable fiscal trajectory at such debt levels.",

In the U.S., the fertility rate has been mostly below replacement level since 1972 and is currently slightly above 1.5. She argues that fertility declines tend to follow improvements in women's employment, education, and reproductive rights, which allow for greater freedom in marriage and childbearing choices. Her main point is that such improvements create a mismatch within couples if men do not increase their contribution to household and childcare responsibilities, leading to delays in having children or to the decision of not having them.",

Lawrence Katz noted that early evidence suggests that generative AI increases productivity in a few tasks—such as professional writing, customer support, and software development—with large gains for novice and less skilled workers, though the impact on employment and wages has still been limited. As our Global Economics team recently noted, we do not expect large AI- driven employment reductions over the next decade, primarily because AI innovation will likely create new work opportunities that help offset job losses from automation. Laura Veldkamp emphasized that the extent to which workers' real wages will rise will depend on whether competition prevents AI companies from accruing most of the productivity increase as profit.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
