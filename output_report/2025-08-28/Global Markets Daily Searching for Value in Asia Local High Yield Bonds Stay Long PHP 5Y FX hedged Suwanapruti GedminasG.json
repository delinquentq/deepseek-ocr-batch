After refreshing the model, considering our latest macro inputs, for example the relatively benign inflation backdrop, suggests that there is more value in Asian local currency high yield markets (than low yield markets), as more benign inflation developments have provided domestic tailwinds for local currency fixed income markets. Within the three high yield local currency bond markets in Asia, we find that IDR and INR local have rallied through our fair value estimates, whereas even after the recent rally, the valuation signal points to scope for even more downside in yields for 5Y PHP bonds (with our fair value estimate at around \\(5.50\\%\\) versus current yield of \\(5.70\\%\\) ).",

The BSP governor noted that the policy rate is at \"goldilocks\" level, but with the caveat that another rate cut is possible. Given our expectations for global growth to slow in H2- 2025 and our more dovish Fed outlook (versus marketing pricing), we think the BSP will deliver another two 25bp cuts (in Q4- 2025 and Q1- 2026) to reach a terminal rate of \\(4.50\\%\\) . Meanwhile, bond supply/demand dynamics are very favorable. The Bureau of Treasury (BTR) sold PHP 507bn of Retail Treasury Bonds earlier this month (including PHP 82bn in debt switches), well above market expectations on strong demand. For context, typical auctions sizes in the Philippines are around PHP 20- 30bn. Separately, there was a large PHP 516bn maturity on the August 12, with another large maturity of PHP 289bn due on September 9, meaning that there has been a net injection of PHP liquidity via bond maturities. We note that Philippines local government bonds are being considered for potential inclusion in the GBI- EM Global Diversified Index, with the announcement due around September. We maintain our recommendation to go long PHP 5Y bonds (FX hedged) (entry \\(5.93\\%\\) , target \\(5.25\\%\\) , stop \\(6.35\\%\\) , current \\(5.70\\%\\) ).",

      "text": "long the 1Y SRBIs. However, with front- end yields having already moved over 110bp since inception and the trade hit our target, we decided to close the trade recommendation and shift to a neutral stance on IDR local government bonds. Bank Indonesia (BI) has cut rates six times since August 2024, from \\(6.25\\%\\) to \\(5.0\\%\\) currently. With July inflation at \\(2.4\\%\\) yoy, comfortably within the BI's target range of \\(1.5 - 3.5\\%\\) , we think the BI has scope to cut rates twice more (by 25bp each in September and Q4) to a terminal rate of \\(4.90\\%\\) . However, we are not as constructive on IDR bonds (compared with PHP bonds) because Indonesian government bonds are already better- owned by foreign investors, IDR bond yields have already moved significantly and there is potentially more scope for the BSP to be do with than the BI, since the latter also has an explicit mandate on FX stability (meaning that the BI may be more inclined to pause easing in periods of currency weakness). Lastly, the GBI- EM Global Diversified Index is considering lowering the cap on market weights from \\(10\\%\\) currently, to \\(8.5\\%\\) . Given that Indonesia (along with China and India) is around the \\(10\\%\\) cap, if this new weighting rule is applied, then this is likely to result in Indonesia's weight being lowered by around \\(1.5\\%\\) (potentially worth around USD 3- 4bn of passive outflows). Given the above macro factors and our signals from our valuation models, we have a neutral stance on IDR government bonds.",

      "text": "Our India economics team revised down their 2025 real GDP growth forecasts to \\(6.5\\%\\) yoy when the US imposed \\(25\\%\\) reciprocal tariffs on India's exports to the US. This week, the US announced another \\(25\\%\\) \"ad valorem\" tariff, citing India's continued energy purchases from Russia, taking total tariffs to \\(50\\%\\) (the highest in all of Asia). Taking into account exemptions, we estimate that the total effective tariff rate on Indian exports to the US would be around \\(32\\%\\) . Our economists had previously highlighted that, if implemented, they could pose a further potential drag to economic growth. We maintain our view that the RBI will cut its policy rate by another 25bp this year to \\(5.25\\%\\) , although we acknowledge that risks are skewed to the dovish side, with the RBI Governor recently commenting that the central bank is ready to step in with policy measures to support growth if the \\(50\\%\\) tariffs comes into effect. INR OIS front- end rates are pricing in around one cut in the next 12- months, which is in line with our forecast. Mid- (5Y) to long- end INR bond yields (10Y, 20Y, 30Y) have been rising on fiscal concerns (in the event the government steps in to support vulnerable groups impacted by tariffs). Given that we think front- end yields are well priced and long- end yields are rising, we have a neutral near- term outlook on INR bonds.",
