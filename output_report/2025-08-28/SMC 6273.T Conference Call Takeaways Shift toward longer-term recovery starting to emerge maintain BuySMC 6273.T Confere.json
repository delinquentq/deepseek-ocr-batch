We are upbeat about SMC taking active measures to address the factors behind the gap between its long- term targets and the current situation. Once demand and SMC's production/sales streamline, we expect to see a recovery in profitability and growth. We reiterate our Buy rating on SMC as a factory automation stock with inexpensive multiples and high growth potential. Below we summarize key points from the conference call.",

However, we have a positive view of the production/inventory adjustments that are now being made. An analysis of operating profit growth shows that although sales volume made a positive contribution, this was more than offset by negative contributions from forex fluctuations and lower production amid inventory adjustments. Usually, when SMC's top- line trends improve, production also improves, but in 1Q prioritizing inventory adjustments had the opposite effect on capacity utilization. SMC looks to be strengthening its inventory management, mainly for semiconductor- related customers, and we believe the effects of this are gradually emerging. Orders from electronics customers, mainly in semiconductors, are also showing signs of picking up in some regions, and we believe SMC's earnings are finally approaching a bottom.",

The company also said customers are aware of the inflationary environment in Japan, which has compelled even SMC to diverge from its very disciplined price retention for pneumatic equipment to date and raise prices. SMC said that \\(60 - 70\\%\\) of customers have already accepted the price hikes and that it could see a real price hike effect of just over \\(5\\%\\) for its domestic business in FY3/26. SMC expects domestic sales of just over \\(180bn\\) in FY3/26, up \\(10\\%\\) yoy, which means a \\(5\\%\\) price hike effect could boost operating profits by almost \\(10bn\\) .

It also recognizes that investors are concerned about the company's large- scale capex amid sluggish earnings. SMC reiterated that these investments are necessary for future growth. It looks to be taking the necessary steps, such as optimizing production and inventory, to close the gap between its targets and current earnings. As part of this, SMC is paying attention to not only profitability but also declining capital efficiency and stock valuation. SMC said it intends to present an updated capital policy by the end of FY3/26 at the earliest, or by the end of FY3/27 (the final year of its long- term plan) at the latest.

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
