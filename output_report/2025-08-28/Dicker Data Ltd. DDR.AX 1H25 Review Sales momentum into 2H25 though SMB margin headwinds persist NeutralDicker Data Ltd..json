FY25 guidance was a key positive at the result, with gross revenue ahead of prior expectations and an implied sequential step up in 2H Pbt margins to support profitability into FY26E. In aggregate, we consider limited scope for near- term earnings outperformance given DDR's significant market position in ANZ and limited evidence of an SMB recovery to date, with current growth factored into the valuation.

That said, DDR's high margins relative to peers, strong balance sheet and tight inventory management place the company in a position to capitalise on market share opportunities as they arise. In addition, DDR's positive working capital cycle offers counter- cyclical cash flow in a potential downturn with the company able to run down inventory to cushion cash flow (as it has done in the past). FY25E represents a tougher environment with softer SMB spending presenting a headwind to margins and earnings growth in the near term. The company has a modest sales growth outlook of mid- single digit FY24- 27E CAGR and appears fairly valued compared to peers and its cash flow generation potential.
