This should result in a peer leading ROE profile, a sharpened focus across Canadian retail/wealth/insurance, and a rejuvenation of the US retail franchise that appears to have stagnated vs US money center bank peers (tough near term given the AML remediation overhang). Mgmt. has an additional growth engine in the form of TD- Cowen which should provide a multi- year runway to gain market share in US capital markets, while also enhancing its relative positioning in Canada. The upcoming investor day provides mgmt. the opportunity to convince the Street that it has the right leadership, the right strategy, and the right mindset on capital allocation that can deliver sustained stock outperformance. We view risk/reward as attractive at 12x FY26E P/E vs. \\(9.3\\%\\) in avg. annual FY26- 28 EPS growth and 1.5x YE26 P/B vs. \\(13.6\\%\\) average ROE forecast and \\(14.4\\%\\) we forecast for FY28.

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least \\(10\\%\\) and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).",
