Given the start of a new fiscal year, we roll over the base period for our DCF model to FY6/35 (final year in our model) from FY6/34. With this, we raise our 12- month target price slightly, to ¥2,900 from ¥2,800. However, we expect the trend in near- term profits to remain subdued.",

It also intends to strengthen its development engineering and R&D structure to enhance its lineup of industry- specific products. The company plans to focus on industries where it has had a limited presence (e.g., manufacturing and retail), and it will need to increase development of related functions, as these industries require industry- specific capabilities.

However, as a percentage of sales, we expect SG&A expenses to decline to 78.6% (down 1.8 pp yoy), with R&D expenses rising to 16.1% (up 1.9 pp yoy), sales & marketing expenses falling to 48.8% (down 4.5 pp yoy), and G&A expenses rising to 13.7% (up 0.8 pp yoy).

Its technological strength lies in simplifying data sharing and other functions across businesses and improving business efficiency by introducing integrated ERP system architecture. We expect the ERP cloud penetration rate to trend upward in Japan against the backdrop of lower costs, increased convenience (including open systems accessible by external entities), and expanded functionality via API integration. However, we expect valuations (P/E and DCF) to remain high even after a swing to profit at the adjusted operating line given intensifying competition in the cloud ERP market and our assumption that upfront spending aimed at acquiring new customers will continue for the time being.",
