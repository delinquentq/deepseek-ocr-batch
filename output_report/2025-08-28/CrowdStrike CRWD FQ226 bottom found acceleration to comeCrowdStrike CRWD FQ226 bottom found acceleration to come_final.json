With that said, while the company beat their guide by ~&#36;21MM in the quarter (+1.8%), they raised full year by just &#36;3MM and emphasized the guide anticipated professional services would be strong - implicitly this guided down subscription revenue in H2. This result is guidance a bit underwhelming vs. consensus, with Q3 guided ~&#36;15MM (midpoint) below consensus and implied Q4 (midpoint) at ~&#36;9MM below consensus.",
