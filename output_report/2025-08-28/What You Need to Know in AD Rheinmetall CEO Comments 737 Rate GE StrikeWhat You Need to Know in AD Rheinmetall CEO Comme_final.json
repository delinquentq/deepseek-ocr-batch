He also noted that similar factories could be built at a similar pace in other NATO countries to contribute to a \"pan- European defense ecosystem\". The Unterluss facility is expected to produce 25,000 rounds of ammunition this year, ramping to a capacity of 350,000 p.a. by 2027. Alongside this, Romania signed a framework agreement with Rheinmetall to build a munitions ignition powder factory for €535m, the country's industry minister said on Wednesday. Furthermore, WirtschaftWoche reported that Lockheed Martin is seeking to have Rheinmetall manufacture missiles in Germany, with Lockheed's Europe head saying \"we are already actively discussing additional manufacturing - including for ATACMS and Hellfire missiles\". Finally, Bild reported that Rheinmetall wants to take over German shipbuilder Naval Vessels Luerssen (NVL), with the board to consider the purchase in the coming weeks. Mr Papperger responded to the reports saying the company is always interested in expanding its portfolio.",

On missile production, we continue to see the JV as a smart method to quickly expand into an area with long- term growth potential. The JV is targeting a production capacity of 10,000 missiles p.a. with production starting in 2027. On NVL, Mr Papperger highlighted on the Q2 25 call that the company was currently in negotiations in the naval segment, with the intention to \"create really a big business\" in order to fill current portfolio gaps. Rheinmetall is targeting to acquire at least one company annually, with >1bn of sales.",
