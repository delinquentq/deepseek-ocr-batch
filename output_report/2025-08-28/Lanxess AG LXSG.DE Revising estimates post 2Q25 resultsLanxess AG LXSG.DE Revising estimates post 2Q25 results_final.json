      "text": "We revise our estimates for Lanxess following its 2Q25 results on August 14. We increase our FY25E adj. EBITDA by \\(2\\%\\) to €504mn on better- than- expected margins despite the lower headline level (updated company EBITDA guidance at €520- €580mn for FY25 - down from €600- 650mn - and Visible Alpha Consensus Data at €540mn). At the divisional level, we decrease our estimates for sales in all segments, but increase margins due to the higher starting point (particularly for Consumer Protection). We now expect lower volume growth in the coming quarters on the back of the tougher comps. We forecast 3Q25 EBITDA of €124mn bringing us \\(8\\%\\) below Visible Alpha Consensus Data at €135mn (with the company mentioning it expects a tough quarter in 3Q). For FY25E, our adj. EBITDA increases by \\(2\\%\\) ; this brings us \\(7\\%\\) below Visible Alpha Consensus Data for the year. Given our weaker- than- consensus margins for the coming years, our 2026/27 EBITDA estimates are now \\(13 / 19\\%\\) below Visible Alpha Consensus. With the higher short- term and lower longer- term EBITDA (due to the lower basis for sales), our 12- month price target remains unchanged, at €20/share. Our investment thesis and Sell rating remain unchanged.",
