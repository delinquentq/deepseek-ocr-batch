At the same time, we are witnessing the rise of vertical platforms, trained on tailored datasets to address sectoral use cases. As a result, the applications of Al - and the models best suited for each - naturally differ across industries. For instance, an Al agent in a recruitment platform is optimized and trained very differently from Al systems designed for drug discovery, or industrial automation solutions. Each vertical requires domain- specific knowledge, data, and training approaches to ensure meaningful outputs. All of these application areas will feature in the upcoming Bernstein AI Conference this September, where we will explore the broader theme: How can Al be used? This report, however, focuses more narrowly on our own industry. We aim to present a perspective on how Al can be deployed effectively within our sector, highlighting both opportunities and practical considerations.",

Unlike many process Industries where standardized frameworks can be applied, and public data is rampant and sufficient, our field relies heavily on the use of \"walled data\" - customized data sets, subscription based data that can't be distributed (or used in Al) on- the- ground- data and qualitative judgment - the very skill that differentiates one sell- side analyst from another or enables a fund manager to outperform peers. Historically, these frameworks have never been fully productized. Instead, much of the know- how within firms has been implicitly transferred across generations: through mentorship, shared practices, and accumulated experience. If we take a step back and outline even a simple perspective on the role of an analyst, we observe that certain steps in the workflow lend themselves to enhancement. Specifically, the pace of progress can be improved through smart search capabilities - even if not full- fledged Al.",

What Al can do is collect a large amount of information and synthesize information to present summary insights. Understanding where Al can provide data will also be critical as some sectors will have prevalence of larger public data sets (say macro) while an emerging sector in an emerging market will be the most challenging to tackle. From our specific context - we believe that Al can most naturally help in information gathering and synthesis, the rest depends on the human employing it.

Prompt engineering is a field in itself, and different prompts tend to have differing effectiveness for varied queries (we've summarized the effective ones in Exhibit 13). Many studies note that as an expert provides more information around his questions and properly structures the prompt, the accuracy of responses is found to increase. Given this result, feeding as much info as possible to the Al may sound like a tempting idea, but it isn't. Overloading queries with excessive, often non- essential details - a phenomenon known as \"prompt bloat\" - is known to actually harm the responses.

Industry analysis becomes fairly good with additional prompts; and more the cross- questioning, the better the response becomes. However, this also means spending more time reading answers and refining queries, the scope and manner of which varies across LLMs. Hence, standardization is difficult to achieve, and we need a SME to spend time on responses and queries to enhance responses beyond the human level. On this generation, we again stopped short of a performance capable of rivaling that of a human expert.

However, in standardized fields where a set of answers are present and the best one needs to be chosen depending on the situation, or fields where a set process, no matter how complicated, always needs to be followed to achieve results, AI are capable of handling virtually all human tasks, and that too at a far higher speed. This explains the difference in SelfScore as seen in Exhibit 7.",

Let's start on a completely honest note, when we started the exercise we had no idea so many different types of prompts exist that we have now highlighted in Exhibit 1. We definitely knew a few since the field of study exists, but the depth that already exists, baffled us. However, the beauty of things like these is even without a theoretical knowledge, we did actually end up using quite a few of these prompts in our Financial Research journey. Most prompts started as a zero shot prompt - except for prompts D, E and G. Prompt D was about building thesis ground up and even in the very initial prompt we provided cues to forecast target price using earnings growth calculations. Prompt E was on historical price analysis and we provided cues on what to look at - new model launches, interest rate changes, and later refined to even segment of new models. Prompt G was just a few- shot version of prompt F which was zero shot.",

We didn't mention the specifics - like middle class formation or wage increases as the test was meant to find out if the AI can bring it up.
