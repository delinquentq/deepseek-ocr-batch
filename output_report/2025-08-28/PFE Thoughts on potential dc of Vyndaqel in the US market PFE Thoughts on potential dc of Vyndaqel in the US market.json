With &gt;80% of US tafamidis scripts already shifted to Vydnamax, discontinuing Vydnaqel is unlikely to cause significant near-term revenue impact for the taf franchise.

The difference lies in their formulations: Vydnaqel uses the micronized meglumine salt form, while Vydnamax uses the free acid form. Vydnamax was developed for greater convenience, as patients only need to take one 61 mg capsule per day, compared to four 20 mg capsules for Vydnaqel. While PFE hasn't disclosed the exact script/rev split between the two, our illustrative analysis based on IQVIA trackers suggests that Vydnamax's share within the tafamidis family has steadily increased over time. Currently, more than 80% of tafamidis revenues in the U.S. are estimated to come from Vydnamax.",
