While this issue is impacting the industry broadly, the degree of pressure appears greater for HRL vs peers, although we think some of the guidance reset could be tied to the recent CEO transition. Additionally, we continue to see the same tailwinds driving an earnings acceleration in FY26 with support from higher pricing, a more favorable supply/demand backdrop for turkey, the ongoing recovery of Planters, and additional cost savings. All in, we reiterate our Buy rating with an updated 12- month price target of \\(\\) 31\\(as we see an attractive risk- reward set- up after the sell- off in the stock today, although we note investors likely need to see better execution to regain confidence.",
