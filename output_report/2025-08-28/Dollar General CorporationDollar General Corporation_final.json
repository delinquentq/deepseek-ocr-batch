DG is continuing to execute against its back to basics focus, with comps that are hovering around industry growth. Key from here will be addressing reinvestment needs in store wage rate and hours, price positioning, as well as supply chain enhancements needed to sustain the momentum amidst a competitive food retail industry backdrop. From a consumer perspective DG has traditionally served as a trade in option for value seekers, and we see these results as more consistent with that positioning.",

We believe the main reason for improving sales is improved in- store execution that is enabling / fostering trade- in for value hungry consumers, yet DG is also expanding its multichannel offering with Uber Eats while building on DoorDash partnership momentum that aids convenience as well. Gross margin of \\(31.3\\%\\) rose 137bps YoY vs. the Street's \\(+60bp\\) outlook. Drivers included lower shrink, higher inventory mark- ups, and lower inventory damages, partially offset by increased LIFO provision, increased markdowns, and increased distribution costs.

The tone of the release suggests that management is pleased with its turnaround progress and that there is ample room to go for further enhancements; however, this suggests that there could be further room for upside relative to the Street's current outlook.

The key will be sustaining the momentum given that Walmart is growing its Plus effort at a double- digit pace, Amazon is expanding its same day grocery offering with more focus in rural areas, and hard discounters like Aldi are continuing to make in- roads. Ultimately our analysis suggests that there is room for \\(15k+\\) dollar stores, yet it is important to demonstrate steady comp growth in the \\(3\\% +\\) range, in our view, to demonstrate that ROI can be maintained and improved while adding store units.",
