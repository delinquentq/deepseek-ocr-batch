Indian officials have responded with resolve, indicating no immediate plans to cease Russian oil imports. The government has not mandated refiners to reduce Russian crude purchases, allowing companies to make operational decisions independently. Additionally, government officials have emphasized that national interests take precedence over commercial considerations, stressing that access to discounted Russian crude remains critical for India's energy security and macroeconomic stability.",

Back in 2022, Russia was concerned that the post- COVID surplus in production capacity was large enough to potentially replace some of its own capacity if it had to cut production due to Western sanctions. Additionally, there were worries that potential buyers might pressure Russian revenues by demanding massive discounts. Today, such concerns no longer exist. The world does not have enough oil to fully replace Russian exports. Even if countries alarmed by Trump's tariff threats hypothetically wanted to explore alternatives, they simply wouldn't be able to find them. The initial discounts ballooned to almost \\(\\) 14\\$ versus Brent, but higher costs of shipping following sanctions reduced the discounts. Under these conditions, if Russia finds itself unable to sell its oil, it would be economically more beneficial for the country to cut production and drive prices higher rather than offer a deep discount.",
