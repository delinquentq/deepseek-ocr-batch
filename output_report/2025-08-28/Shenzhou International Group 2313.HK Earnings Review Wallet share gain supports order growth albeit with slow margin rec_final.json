Shenzhou's wallet share gain is underpinned by strong product development and fabric know- how, category expansion and the vertically- integrated supply chain. On the other hand, a key investor focus - GPM recovery trajectory appears slower- than- expected, which in our view reflects the labor cost hikes in China that can't effectively be passed through to customers, unfavourable product mix/customer mix, and the company's efforts to solidify relationship with customers amid the choppy global demand environment.",
