It is strategically positioned across the growing categories of cloud infrastructure and managed services, backed by its portfolio of data centre assets including its up to 63MW campus in Macquarie Park (incl. IC3W). We expect a robust earnings growth outlook driven by the ramp- up of hyperscale cloud deployments and continued growth in managed services, with long- term shareholder value creation underpinned by attractive returns on data centre investments. We believe that MAQ is fairly valued on a SOTP basis compared to peers, with high- quality underlying businesses across the IT stack from data centre infrastructure to managed services and cybersecurity. We are positive on management's strategy and long history of successful execution, but at current valuation levels we see this as priced into the shares. We are Neutral rated. Key risks to our view include: 1) Execution risk on data centre development plans; 2) Segment growth outlooks; 3) Funding risk.",
