Importantly, AFRM also delivered its first quarter of operating income profitability.- Scaling new products: Affirm Card is quickly becoming a material growth engine, deepening consumer engagement at the POS and creating a data flywheel that strengthens risk decisioning. Highlights: (1) active cardholders grew +97% YoY to 2.3M, (2) in-store card spend jumped +187% YoY, and (3) TTM spend per cardholder rose to $4,500 from $3,500. If the card expands a core use case to be what we would call a \"pseudo debit-card\" being used for everyday spend at the POS, Affirm's already leading risk engine gets even better. Beyond the card, other BNPL products are scaling rapidly: 0% APR volumes grew +93% YoY and Pay-in-X grew +50% YoY. Notably, 0% APR drove 50% of all new-to-Affirm users, integrating them into the ecosystem and unlocking cross-sell into higher-margin products.- RLTC tailwinds: While mix shift toward 0% APR and Pay-in-X loans pressures margins, F4Q25 brought meaningful offsets that position RLTC% to exceed the 4% target in FY26. Gain on sale of loans rose +67% YoY, fueled by ramping forward flow partnerships (e.g., Sixth Street), adding +16 bps of revenue as a % of GMV. We",
