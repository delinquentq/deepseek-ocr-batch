Record- low funding costs along with strong demand for credit generated from the ECB QE, was pivotal. This was in contrast to the trend in Q1 2020, when volumes declined (vs. the CDS index market) because of the unprecedented market shock from Covid- 19. The market sell- off in 2022 on the back of the inflation shock across the globe was more detrimental to the corporate bond market than previous episodes. Liquidity became more challenging, especially in the first three quarters of the year. This was on the back of a much longer- lasting rates market headwind. The need for scalable instruments with lower transaction costs to trade credit pushed investors into the CDS index market at levels never seen before.",
