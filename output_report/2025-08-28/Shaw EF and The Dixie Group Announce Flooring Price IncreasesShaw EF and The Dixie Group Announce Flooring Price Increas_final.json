The May/June increases were much more narrow in scope, targeted for only certain product categories, market segments, and only on imported products. This time around, it is encouraging the increases are broader in scope, with EF, which historically has been more aggressive on price to gain share, and Dixie announcing price increases for domestically produced products (more specific below).

Since the Covid related spike in demand and inflation, leading to higher prices, flooring manufacturers have given back the bulk of the price increases given softer demand and have seen margins compress as inflation has continued to be a headwind. Demand remains uneven, and the channel is likely flush with inventory from pre- buys ahead of tariffs. However, with costs increasing as a result of tariffs, it is encouraging that demand and pricing may be finding a bottom. We would expect manufacturers to see some traction on imported products (namely LVT) and it's less clear for domestically produced products. We have not seen MHK announce an increase, but would expect the company to follow.",
