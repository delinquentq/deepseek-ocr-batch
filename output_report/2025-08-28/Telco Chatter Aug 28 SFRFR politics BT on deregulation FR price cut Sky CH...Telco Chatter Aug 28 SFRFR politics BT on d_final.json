      "text": "With this short note, we review recent developments in relation to SFR's ongoing debt restructuring plans, as well as emerging debates around how French PM Bayrou's surprise 8th September confidence vote might potentially impact the French Telcos. Highlights include: (1) On 4th August, the Paris Commercial Court approved SFR's accelerated safeguard, enabling implementation of its debt restructuring plans. According to La Tribune, unions have since filed an appeal, and SFR's Economic and Social Committee is concurrently attempting to suspend the safeguard. But reports indicate the public prosecutor's office has, by contrast, chosen not to appeal, leaving a successful suspension unlikely. Overall, we consider SFR's October debt restructuring plans to be on track. The closing of this restructuring process is seen as a pre- requisite to the potential consummation of French Telco consolidation talks; (2) Whilst this week's French political turmoil has seen both Bouygues and Orange's shares trade off \\(\\sim 5\\%\\) , we consider this a buying opportunity. Our economist expects the September confidence vote simply to pull forward the fall of the Bayrou government by a few months, resulting in yet another weak government. He considers a new lower- house election very unlikely. Critically, we argue that political change should not in any way impact French Telco consolidation prospects, and the compelling valuations of both Orange and Bouygues already over- discount generic macro risks. Ways in which political turmoil might impact the Telco sector include: (i) driving an extension of the current tax surcharge, (ii) helping buyers negotiate down the break- up value of SFR, and (iii) leading the government to place a portion of its stake in Orange. We consider any such effects modest and dwarfed by the rich catalyst pipelines offered by both Orange (OW, AFL) and Bouygues (upgraded to OW on Tuesday).",

      "text": "Mark Shurmer, Managing Director of Regulation at Openreach (BT), has urged Ofcom to ease market regulations in UK areas deemed competitive due to the presence of Virgin Media's fixed broadband network or three or more full fibre (FTTP) network providers. Openreach, holding 'Significant Market Power (SMP)', faces various rules to address competition concerns, including price controls and fair access requirements. Openreach's FTTP network covers nearly 20m premises, with plans to reach 30m by 2030. Ofcom's Telecoms Access Review 2026 aims to promote competition and investment in gigabit broadband, proposing to redefine competitive areas. Shurmer argues for reduced restrictions in areas with established operators such as Virgin Media, O2 and CityFibre. Despite Openreach's line losses to rivals, Shurmer warns that existing measures may hinder their fibre broadband targets. Altogether, however, contend that competition is still developing, with concerns over revised area definitions. The regulator faces the challenge of balancing interests in a transitional market, with final proposals for TAR 2026 expected soon. (Source: ISPreview)",

Just two weeks after its introduction, the monthly rate during the first year has been reduced from €28.99 to €26.99. The standard price thereafter has also been cut, dropping from €35.99 to €33.99/month. The minimum commitment period remains 12 months. This price package is more generous than Bouygues's previous entry- level option, the 'Bbox Fit' dual- play package, which did not include TV content. While matching the connectivity features and VoIP allowance of this earlier offer, 'Bbox Rentree' also includes a 4K- enabled set- top box, providing access to over 180 channels and 100 hours of TV recording.

The ministry said this may lead to action in areas such as dedicated planning procedures for data centres, work on securing power supplies and quicker connections to the electricity grid, support for developing new and existing locations for data centres and further work on innovative technology for the infrastructure.
