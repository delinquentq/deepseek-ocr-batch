Although AI server mix is likely a drag on margins, the underperformance in traditional servers and storage is masking improving AI server margins in F2H26. Second, ISG margins of 8.8% missed GS/consensus of 9.6%/9.4% reflecting underperformance in traditional servers and storage (both sub- seasonal growth, which was expected, to be fair) as well as worse- than- expected AI server margins that was hurt by heightened competition in early Blackwell deals, one- time expedite costs, and geopolitical/supply chain resiliency costs. AI server margins should improve in F2H26 given the absence of these headwinds. Third, CSG revenue missed, but EBIT was better on favorable commodity costs and strong SMB demand. CSG margins should improve in F2H v. F1H given by revenue growth and share gains.",

That said, DELL saw strong momentum in its owned IP, with double digit growth in PowerStore. Second, traditional server demand in North America (DELL's most profitable region) was also challenged in the quarter as federal spending continues to be weak, though demand grew in all other regions. DELL expects traditional servers to grow in F2H26 - though at a more muted level than expected at the beginning of the year when DELL guided to FY26 share gains in a \\~LSD% growth end market - driven by the ongoing refresh opportunity, as \\~70% of DELL's installed base of traditional servers is on 14G or older. Third, guidance implies that ISG performance is weighted towards F4Q. Specifically, DELL's guidance for: (1) ISG growth in the low 20s% for F3Q26; (2) mid to high 20s% for FY2026; and (3) YTD ISG performance implies that F4Q ISG revenue growth should be in the high 20s% yoy. Further, DELL's comments that AI server shipments will be slightly weighted towards the third quarter imply an even larger contribution from traditional servers and storage in F4Q26.",

In our view, DELL's diversified portfolio positions the company to benefit from (1) an inflection in industry PC trends driving growth in CSG segment revenue, which should also benefit from product innovation in higher- end PCs and greater exposure to commercial PCs; (2) a return to growth in the ISG segment following a rebasing of estimates, with DELL's market leading position in enterprise servers & storage positioning the company to be an IT partner- of- choice, which should help it maintain or gain share across key enterprise categories; and (3) shareholder friendly capital return",
