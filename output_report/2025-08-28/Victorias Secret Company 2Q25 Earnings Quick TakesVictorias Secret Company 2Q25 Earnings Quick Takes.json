While 1) the 2Q results to us represent another positive datapoint in VSCo's turnaround trajectory, & 2) reiterated FY EBIT/EPS guidance against 2Q outperformance diminishes the previous FY EPS risk we cautioned, this is balanced by 3) our still- limited conviction in a positive EPS revision path & steady- state growth/profitability profile considering 2H macro uncertainty & a still- early- days turnaround (which can prove lengthy & non- linear).

We view the print as a positive datapoint for the turnaround, where we had already grown more constructive LQ (more here) - especially mgmt. comments around 1) core intimates improvement, 2) PINK apparel momentum, 3) ongoing Beauty strength, & 4) intentionally reduced discounting activity.
