Trump's threat to impose extra hard hitting sanctions on Russia seems more like faster than genuine intent, as the implications on global markets would be severe. USD/rub barely batted an eyelid, with the pair trading in an 80.25/50 range. Can't see it changing much again today.",

This was my first area to fade, although only sold a small amount given price action has not been too encouraging after the false break of 17.50. That being said we are back lower overnight, helped by the offered tone in USDASIA, whilst we also saw some HF ZAR buying yesterday afternoon, albeit small. I still like dollar shorts, but hard to be too engaged until we get the next bout of US data. I do think Fed independence worries will also keep the dollar offered, but a little nervous that this is negative for risk and EM struggles to rally. Hence sold some USDZAR towards 17.75, but with lower conviction.",

We have been seeing better outflows from the client side this week, as well as MSCI related outflows in market in addition to the usual RHS interest from corporates. The outflows have been mainly offset by state bank offers rather than any fresh inflows from internationals. Following the round trip after the Jackson Hole, the broad dollar seems to be in consolidation mode taking cues from the rates market focusing on the US NFP print next week. Meanwhile, CBT's focus on real TRY appreciation remains an anchor for the long TRY view. In absence of any meaningful local political risk events until mid- September (CHP Court case on \\(15^{\\text{th}}\\) September), this should also assist CBT in anchoring domestic expectations as the easing cycle resumes.",

Wages were hot yesterday and after a hawkish NBH rate cuts continue to get pushed back. Gas is also moving back lower, terms of trade are improving, and unemployment lower this AM, and whilst these are positives for HUFs, they are not necessarily new or the smoking gun to take EURHUF firmly back through 395. With the market nervy (and very choppy) over month end happy to see where the dust settles and stick to just a core long HUF.",
