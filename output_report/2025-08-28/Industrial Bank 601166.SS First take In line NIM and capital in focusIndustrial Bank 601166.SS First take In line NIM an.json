We summarize the prints as 1) The reported NIM printed \\(1.75\\%\\) in 2Q25, - 11/5bps yoy/qoq, and GS calculated NIM came in at \\(1.39\\%\\) , - 10/7bps yoy/qoq, modestly lower than expected (- 2bps vs. GSe), reversing the trend of sequential NIM improvement in 1Q25, leading to a - 4% NII decline with \\(3\\%\\) asset growth. 2) Loan growth remained subdued at \\(+4\\% / + 2\\%\\) yoy/qoq, while RWA expanded by \\(7\\%\\) yoy, lifting RWA density by 4/1ppts yoy/qoq to \\(78\\%\\) , suggesting continued inefficient capital usage, consistent with the 1Q25 trend (see here). 3) Net profit growth of \\(4\\%\\) was supported by a - 13% reduction in provision, partly offset by higher taxes. With a \\(1.2\\%\\) NPL formation rate (+18bps qoq and +7bps vs. GSe), the NPL coverage ratio declined to \\(229\\%\\) (- 5ppts qoq and - 10ppts vs. GSe), signaling persistent asset quality pressure, despite a declining retail NPL ratio. We expect investors focus to center on 1) NIM trajectory for 2H25 and 2026, 2) asset quality trend, 3) guidance on loan and RWA growth, along with capital deployment, and 4) progress on convertible bond conversion and other capital raising plan following the completion of SOE banks' recapitalization.
