Benefited from its direct operating model, the company has better understanding of its riders. In addition, it has a good promotion mechanism for riders, which has attracted over 200K younger riders aged between 18 and 22. (6) GPM. In 1H25, GPM slightly narrowed by 0.2pp YoY mainly due to an increasing spending on riders in May to ensure service quality and fulfillment amid the intensified competition in food delivery industry. This spending has gradually stabilized and declined after May and Co expects a stable GPM going forward.

As of Jun 2025, over 300 unmanned vehicles had been put into daily operation, covering more than 60 cities nationwide, with an average of approximately 20K active trips per month. Co expects to put into operation thousands of unmanned vehicles by 2028 which will help improve cost efficiency. The unmanned vehicles will deliver parcels for its parent SF Holding, as well as other players. (9) Al. In 1H25, Co actively promoted multi- scenario applications of Al large models, cooperating with a number of leading domestic large model vendors, and applying self- developed Al agent tools in areas such as rider management, local delivery outlet manager services, intelligent customer service, and merchant operations to assist in communication, information collection, operational analysis, and anomaly monitoring.
