With the\\) 37\\%\\(guide for FY26, that reflects about 400 bps of expansion over the next 3 years - while we did not get where exactly that expansion would come from, we believe the bulk of it should come from sales & marketing leverage, as the go-to-market initiatives like growing - store, realigning channel incentives around new business versus renewals, and channel consolidation, should drive slower S&M growth. There will still be operating leverage across R&D and G&A, but again we think the bulk of this 400 bps in margin expansion will come from S&M. Importantly, ADSK noted that this margin target was flexible, meaning it would be achievable in a range of growth scenarios - that's refreshing for ADSK veterans that remember long-term targets where circumstances changed.

More specifically on the top-line, we model FY27 revenue of \\(\\)7,845M\\(or 11% growth - within this, we assume underlying growth of ~9% (ex model impact), and then layer in -\\)160M in transition benefit. Stepping back, we get to this \\(\\)160M\\(estimate by compiling the quarterly revenue benefits since 2Q25 when the agency transition started in North America - that sum since then is -\\)254M, and we will lap the last geography moving to agency in November 2025, so we estimate by end of FY26, the accumulated benefit over two years would be -\\)440M. Recall, when this transition was first announced, ADSK noted that about \\(\\)600M\\(in contra-revenue would shift back into revenue - so keeping that number unchanged minus\\)440M\\(across the last two years, gets us to\\)160M\\(in FY27E. From a margin perspective, remember as more revenue comes from the agency model, the more it will weigh on margins (and hence that commentary on the ADSK call) - so we model about 100 bps of margin improvement, with as-reported margins at -38%.",

      "text": "- **Other modelling tidbits: (1) 2H26 billings growth is normalizing post the transition - remember Japan was the last geography to shift in November 2024, so FY27 billings we think grows at normal rates; (2) cash taxes will not be significant benefit in FY27, but restructuring also should not repeat - we think more FCF margin expansion will happen in FY28-29.** Billings growth accelerated in 2Q, but implied 2H guide reflects materially slower growth and while some of that is prudence, we also think some of it is normalization after this agency transition. Remember, Japan was the last geography to shift to the new model in November 2024 - so with mostly annual contracts, the impact of the transition on billings will mostly normalize by November 2025 by our estimates. In fact, this means that the transition impact to billings normalizes about a year earlier than the impact to revenue - which makes sense given the ratability. Therefore looking forward, we think FY27 billings growth will grow at their natural underlying rate, or about 9% by our estimates with little/no impact from the transition. The one curve ball in FY27 might be cash taxes, which is unusual because OBBBA is largely taking up FCF estimates on lower cash taxes - it may be different for ADSK because this year is already expected to have a \\(\\)130-150M\\(cash tax benefit, so there may not be much of an OBBBA benefit in FY27 as a result. That said, there probably will not be another restructuring charge, but these are just a couple of the puts and takes to FY27E FCF.**",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
