      "text": "Luxury Macro Tracker - China July data shows some encouraging signs, but trends remain choppy - Louise Singlehurst updates her tracker to reflect the latest China datapoints on the back of increased investor interest in a potential Chinese recovery. The new datapoints are broadly encouraging, supporting prior updates in July (here and here) where Louise flagged that she sees the region stabilising in the 2H. A key positive is the recovery in handbag imports from Europe which has the highest correlation to sector underlying growth (Europe to China Leather handbag imports are \\(+7\\%\\) in July, the first positive month since Jan 2024). Data has some negatives too, including July total retail sales missing expectations, but the categories most correlated with underlying sector growth showed sequential improvement. Louise maintains the view that we have seen a bottom and China can stabilise in 2H, albeit off a low base.",

Acquisitions are central to Christian Hinderaker's Buy thesis on Halma which he outlined in his initiation earlier this month. With this acquisition, Halma has committed c. £2bn of capital across 95 acquisitions over the last 20 years, funded out of FCF. Yet, despite this consistent M&A track record, consensus does not model acquisitions leaving Christian 5- 10% ahead on revenues FY27E- 29E. Christian expects HSD OSG to be enhanced with M&A and that this growth formula is simple and sustainable. Buy.",
