The company has set a preliminary target of 400MW capacity delivery in 2026 implying 300- 400MW order wins in the next 12 months. No orders in 2Q25 was a result of financial constraints as more capacity delivery in 2025 could further increase its leverage ratio. New project IRR reached mid- teens levels due to faster ramp up from customers and shortened testing period while MSR is largely stable. Supply side also remains disciplined with no incremental datacenter projects approved after the window guidance from the government.",
