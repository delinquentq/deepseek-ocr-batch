      "text": "F2Q results were solid but not exceptional. The initial negative reaction was driven by the F3Q and the implied F4Q revenue guide coming in below expectations, compounded by net new ARR of &#36;221mn missing the bogey of &#36;230mn. The stock recovered from its after-hour lows once mgmt introduced its 2H ARR guide, which calls for at least 40% net new ARR growth, though this comes against a -25% comp. This commentary implies ending FY26 ARR growth of at least 22%. By our math, this suggests 3Q net new ARR of ~&#36;238mn, representing mid to high single-digit Q/Q growth, vs. consensus at &#36;205mn. For F4Q,implied net new ARR is about &#36;290mn. The incremental disclosure was more constructive than feared. However, as we highlighted in our TAP U/P into earnings (note here), the bull case requires an exit ARR growth rate of +23%, which our channel checks do not support. Mgmt's 2H outlook hinges not just on CCP renewals (which we believe won't kick off until F4Q/F1Q27) but further net new Flex adoption, and overall pipeline momentum across the entire platform. With most CCP delivered through Flex, sustaining momentum requires customers to re-Flex at renewal or as they draw down existing CCP. Our partner data suggests limited evidence of this behavior along with in-line Flex consumption, raising questions about the ability to achieve the implied net new dollar contribution. Results this quarter benefited from stronger pro-services, with customers turning to CRWD's incident response (IR) following several high-profile breaches. These included incidents tied to the ChatGPT 5 rollout and security failures at MSFT & SentinelOne.While mgmt did not quantify the benefit, we are assuming based on our own analysis and looking at historical trends that it could have equated to ~&#36;10mn for the quarter. Regarding the pending Onum acquisition, mgmt indicated on our call back that the deal will be immaterial and is primarily a tech tuck-in designed to accelerate SIEM adoption. Looking ahead, the upcoming Sept 17th A-Day/Customer Conf represents the next key catalyst, offering investors the opportunity to gather feedback from customers and partners on CCP, Flex adoption, and usage dynamics. We are removing CRWD from the TAP U/P list.",
