On upside - maintaining 1H25's 2- yr stack of - 9% throughout 2H25 would translate to same- store sales growth roughly Flat Y/Y in 3Q (matching July's exit rate) and a - 2% decline in 4Q, equating to FY25 comp growth of down 2% (> mgmt's - 4% to - 5% outlook).",

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
