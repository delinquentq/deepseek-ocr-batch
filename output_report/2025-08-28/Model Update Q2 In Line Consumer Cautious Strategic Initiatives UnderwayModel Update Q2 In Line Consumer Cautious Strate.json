This includes a new app with a mobile web relaunch in October. Heaf noted co is underutilizing 1000s of ft of window space in off-mall locations and will use it to enhance brand storytelling. To improve packaging and labeling, co intends to highlight 48-hr hydration on body lotions, emphasize stress relief and sleep benefits for aromatherapy products,and increase messaging for dermatologist-tested products. Packaging upgrades, esp in candles,are solid, though some reviews express the view that the design upgrade does not justify the almost 50% price markup. Heaf stressed that co's biggest oppty to drive durable growth is new customer acquisition, esp younger consumers, which will be supported by expanding disty with third parties and internationally. We're encouraged by co's updated initiatives and efforts to reduce promos and lean on product marketing/Storytelling to drive AUR growth.",
