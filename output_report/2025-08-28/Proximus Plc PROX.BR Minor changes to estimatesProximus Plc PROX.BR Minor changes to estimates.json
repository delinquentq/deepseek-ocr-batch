As a reminder, Proximus now guides for \\(5\\% - 10\\%\\) Global EBITDA declines in 2025 vs. previous expectations of around \\(+20\\%\\) growth. This is partially offset by an upgraded outlook in the domestic unit where the company now guides for up to \\(+2\\%\\) FY25 EBITDA growth (previously expected to be broadly stable). As a result of both updates, Group EBITDA is now guided to grow up to \\(+1\\%\\) in FY25 vs. \\(+2\\%\\) previously. Separately, we note the large revision to our 2025 EPS is a function of €80mn of incidental revenues and costs reported in 2Q25 related to M&A, litigation and transformation. We do not view these changes as material and there is no change to our thesis, price target or rating.",

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
