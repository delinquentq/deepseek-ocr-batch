We think some of the weakness in the stock could be attributed to the rare miss on operating margins with SG&A coming in much higher than expected. The company also introduced 3Q25 guidance, which came in below consensus (LSEG Data & Analytics) expectations. That said, in our view, the stock reaction seems overdone today, noting our FY25 EPS estimate is only moving down \\(\\sim 1\\%\\) . We would also highlight that gross margin came in above expectations, with mix-adjusted AUR growing LSD in 2Q, while SG&A was pressured due to higher selling expenses. We remain positive on BBWI given the company is well positioned to provide customers with value by offering affordable luxuries, along with the number of initiatives the company has for growth, including its robust pipeline of product ideas, newness, collaborations, and growth in category adjacencies, and an increase in personalized marketing. Additionally, we view the valuation as highly attractive with the stock trading at 8.0x NTM P/E. We reiterate our Buy rating with a 12- month price target of \\$39.",

On 8/18, BBWI introduced the Disney Villains Collection (available to loyalty members on 3/26- 27 and to all customers on 9/3) and announced a longer- term relationship between Bath & Body Works and Disney, noting on the call that the companies have entered into a multi- year partnership. Collaborations can get customers into the store during lull periods and drive excitement outside of the holidays, which we see as an important driver going forward. We would also flag that in 1Q, BBWI's Disney Princess collaboration exceeded internal expectations and drove growth in body care. In terms of cadence, May was softer (largely impacted by the timing of the SAS), June was strong from a sales and traffic perspective, and July was more back to normal (when normalized for the Halloween launch and Prime Days). Looking to 3Q, key performance drivers include the Disney Villains launch, fall assortment, and a single fragrance launch which will come at the end of the quarter.",
