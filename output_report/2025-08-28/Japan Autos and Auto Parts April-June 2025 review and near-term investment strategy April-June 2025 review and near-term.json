Auto demand has been steadier than we expected, notably in the US, benefiting both OEMs and parts makers. Tire makers also reported strong results amid steady progress in passing on tariff costs in prices. Upcoming catalysts for the sector include an effective cut in tariff rates, progress in trade talks with Canada, Mexico, and others, and price hikes in the US. We are bullish on the sector near- term. Among subsectors, we favor OEMs/tiemakers, followed by parts. Among individual stocks, we highlight Mazda and Toyo Tire.",

      "text": "Autos — Our focus in the near term is on the timing of tariff cuts and US trends. Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda assume that tariffs will be cut in August, while Honda and Subaru assume September. We estimate that a 1- month delay in cuts to tariffs on exports from Japan to the US would have a gross impact of ¥60bn at Toyota, ¥10bn at Honda, ¥8bn at Nissan, ¥15bn at Subaru, ¥8bn at Mazda, and ¥2bn at Mitsubishi Motor. The outcome of talks between the US and Canada/Mexico is also a key point. OEMs expect US sales to slow in H2 from the strong levels seen in July. If sales remain strong in August and out, we think investors may see this is an opportunity, in which case the balance between volume and prices will be key, in our view. Toyota, which we see as the price leader, has hiked its prices on vehicles produced in July by c1%, but we see potential for further hikes given the firm's low incentives and sparse inventories. Subaru announced price hikes of 4%- 5% in late May, and sales have now normalized following a pre- hike rush and post- hike drop- off. The firm has also kept incentives down, excluding those aimed at eliminating Outback stock as the model reaches the end of its cycle. We think it would be positive for other sector names if Toyota were to implement further price hikes. Among individual names, we are positive near- term on Mazda (constructive message on maintaining DPS, easing of environmental regs), Toyota (potential for more US price hikes), and Suzuki (emerging story of sharp H2 recovery in India prompted by GST cut, EV ex- India may materialize on greater investor awareness of third- country transactions). We think investors may be wise to avoid Yamaha (a falling FY12/26 consensus) and Isuzu (possible downward revisions to the medium- term plan at Q2 results).",

Toyota has the momentum to reach 10mn units, in our view, and in FY3/27 when we expect production bottlenecks in Japan and the US to be resolved, conditions should be ripe for production to grow. Suppliers to OEMs other than Toyota, which have been a worry, look to be able to deliver in line with their budgets. With the gap in performance between Aisin and Denso widening, inquiries about both firms are increasing, and we think a catalyst for change in relatively performance could come as soon as Denso's Dialog Day, usually held at year- end. Toyoda Gosei's mold profits were at lower- than- expected levels but overall its results were good, with the details better than the optics suggest.",

      "text": "Tires — We got the impression that there were lots of upbeat comments regarding price pass-throughs as a response to US tariffs. For instance, Toyo Tire commented that the passenger vehicle tires that it imports suffered from a decline once the spike in demand to beat tariffs had subsided but that now orders are recovering. Tire makers are offsetting the impact of tougher competition with Chinese tires via structural improvements to the mix, and there has been no change in the overall sector narrative: higher profits and enhanced returns to shareholders. (See our Deep Dive report on tires). Weekly price tracking (see our price survey) also shows that price hikes are continuing, with the average rate of price hikes in passenger vehicle tires reaching 4% since April. At the stock level, we highlight Toyo Tire. We see the medium-term plan, which we expect to be released in February next year, as a catalyst, on top of strong US sales. We continue to like the way Yokohama Rubber is sustaining growth in auto tires and growing earnings again in the OHT business. It is also changing its stance on shareholder returns. We need to pay close attention to what happens with tariff negotiations between the US and India but we believe these risks are already in the company estimates and are likely to be absorbable by price hikes. Sumitomo Rubber shares have been marked laggards, due to concerns of a full year miss and the low US local sourcing rate, but we regard this moment as a good buying opportunity for the longer run. In FY12/26 and thereafter, we anticipate restructuring benefits and an impact from the acquisition of the Dunlop brand. Moreover, we think interest levels in the firm's Sensing Core technology could rise with the new acquisition in the US (the firm aims to generate profits of ¥10bn here in 2030).",

      "text": "PointNissanThe QI operating loss was &#x27;108.0bn excecution one-time fad costs out performed guidance of &#x27;200bn, which had been seen as the minimum We see room for the company to outperform QI guidance for a loss of &#x27;100bn. Also, given the company views of the new management team Business portfolio restructuring is progressing steadily, and IR has improved. However, sales are weak and its remaining for the growth strategy.ISUZUQI results were in line with guidance. The full-year opportunity are in after-sales service, forecasts and tariffs. The risks are in Thailand, North America, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia, etc. Isuzu puts the growth of tariffs at &#x27;140bn over the full year. The company raised US prices in August. There are no signs of a recovery in Thailand. The company may revise down the FY3/27 targets in its medium-term plan when reporting Q2 results. Price hikes in Japan should begin to contribute from Q4 into next fiscal year.ToyotaGuidance for the full-year was lowered, but we see it as conservative. Toyota forecasts a 2% YoY decline in US retail sales from Q2 onward. In Q1, prices and sales expenses had a positive impact on profit of around &#x27;40bn, but Toyota does not expect a positive contribution over the full year. Inventory levels are low. Price hikes in North America should be a future catalyst. Profits are expanding steadily in the value chain. Then the price in the review of group costs - shareholdings will likely come next fiscal year or later.HinoWe think the internal target for QI OP was around &#x27;2bn. The assumption for fixed cost appears very conservative. There is near term risk for US sales, but we expect out performance over the full year. An OPM of &#x27;5% is now in sight for Hino. The company targets an OPM of 8% in the longer term by obtaining accreditation for large trucks in Japan and overcoming accreditation delays overseas. Tariffs should have minimal impact. The company could announce an outline of the merger around Oct 2018, while an extraordinary meeting of shareholders is scheduled for November.MMCWe see that all the bad news is exhausted with the downward estimates of August 27. The firm revised down its sales outlook, reflecting current conditions, for Europe, Indonesia, and Australia, etc. We get the impression that there is a buffer on the cost front in MMC estimates. Benif Q2 earnings are only on par with Q1, we are expecting a new model benefits from the New District, etc., in IR and out. Orders from new models are strong. We also hope to hear updates on the alliance.MazdaWe welcome company comments that the full-year dividend will be around the same as last fiscal year&#x27;s &#x27;55. We estimate that the cost of complying with environmental standards will have a negative impact of around &#x27;15bn this fiscal year, but a positive impact of at least &#x27;50bn YoY next fiscal year. Aone-month delay to the lowering of the tariff would have a negative impact on earnings of around &#x27;8bn. Management expects benefits from cost-cutting from IR this fiscal year into next fiscal year. The tariffs reduce sensitivity to the USD JPY from negative impact of &#x27;43.7bn to &#x27;90mn from each &#x27;1/&#x27;5 depreciation in the USD.HondaManagement revised up for the full year but the IR force assumption is conservative &#x27;135&#x27;. North American sales remained strong through July. In Asia, auto sales are weak in China. US price hikes are the opportunity. Price hikes by competitors will be the key. We expect losses on BE&#x27;s to improve next fiscal year. Motorcycles sales are strong. We expect a pause in share buybacks once the already announced is completed. We expect more detail sales disclosure by business segment.SuzukiIndia retail sales have gotten off to a slow start but the cut to the GST (10.8% from 28% is the leading scenario) announced on August 15 has led to a rapid rise in expectations. If the cut is timed to align with the Diwali on October 20, we think buyers could back through September and that demand would then increase in October and thereafter. Shipments are thus set to build up in the year. We are also upbeat about the materialization of EV- and India on increased attention being paid to third- country trading.SubaruTariffs had little impact in Q1 and extraordinary factors did not affect the effect of change in forecasts. Caution is necessary for Q2, given that production will decline due to domestic plant shut-downs and the 25% tariff will take effect in full. US sales fell in June after price hikes but were strong in July. If the July trend continues, there could be potential for earnings overshoots. The company is also announcing a longer-term strategy by year-end.Toyota IndustriesQ1 the &#x27;110bn downward revision to full-year operating profit, &#x27;80bn was due to volumes. We think initial guidance was overly optimistic. We had thought that this year guidance would finally be conservative, but with the picture at almost all businesses worsening, the worst may not be over. The dividend is likely to be maintained due to an emphasis on stability. The company will aim to push the business into a door land vehicle (CLVs) into the black by net relying on volume growth and by reducing fixed costs.DensoQ1 OP was somewhat weak start to the year if the capital gain of &#x27;9.2bn on the sale of a subsidiary is excluded. Sluggish sales of electric compressors meant a weak start to earnings in the auto business. Orders for forklifts and logistic solutions were not too bad, but macro concerns remain. We focus on tariffs on steel and aluminum. The TOBever could take place after Q2 results. We take a wait-and-see stance.Stanley ElectricQ1 OP fell short of internal guidance on the &#x27;12.5bn impact of tariffs. Deposits full-year tariff payments at &#x27;100bn. It intends to recover the entire amount, but risks remain. Customer production levels are somewhat stronger than expected. We expect a Dialog Day 2025 at year-end, at which the main focus will likely be on the cash allocation and the target DoE. Targets for growth in vehicle electrical traction will also be key given the slowdown in BE&#x27;s.AisinQ1 OP was impacted by lower auto production volumes at dient Honda but there were continued contributions from the Aisin motor body business and streamlining. Stanley assumes a full-year tariff impact of &#x27;5bn (net) and plans to pass the higher costs on in prices. We will watch to see whether there are continued contributions from the motor body business and streamlining. New auto models are set to launch from IR.KoitoQ1 OP outperformed internal guidance by &#x27;14bn. This broke down into costs of &#x27;4.5bn due to strength. Toyota and rotationalization, &#x27;6.0bn thanks to the recovery of one-time costs, and &#x27;3.5bn due to delays between quarters in the recognition of expenses. We forecast Q2 OP of &#x27;40bn. The company puts full-year tariff payments at just under &#x27;70bn. So guidance for &#x27;20bn looks to contain an impulse level. The tariff contribution of growth in BE&#x27;s sales will not start until IR. We expect then MTP to be released early next year.Toyoda GoseiQ1 OP was &#x27;2bn above internal plan thanks to increased production volumes at customers. Koito thinks Q2 OP will fall &#x27;8.8bn QOQ to &#x27;3.1bn but we feel this is conservative. Koito has faced ongoing levels like a full-year tariff impact of &#x27;3bn (net) and lower volume in North America. The key from here is the impact on production volume from tariffs.YokohamaQ1 OP outperformed internal guidance by &#x27;3bn. Volume growth and rotationalization contribute to the impact of &#x27;1bn and the delayed recognition of costs added &#x27;2bn. Negatives included the impact of tariffs (-&#x27;1.5bn) and declines in sales of molds. The company estimates full-year tariff payments at just under &#x27;9bn. Guidance factors in negative tariff impact of &#x27;2.5bn net of prices-pass throughs, which we see is adequate.YokohamaH1 OP outperformed guidance by just under &#x27;15bn. The strength of autotires and a recovery in off-highway tires contributed in Q2. The company raised full-year guidance but still fully factors in the risk of tariffs in India (we estimate that a 25% additional tariff would have an annual impact of &#x27;10bn). Profit growth is likely to be a key factor, given the acquisition of Goodyear&#x27;s offroad tire business. The payout ratio will be increased next fiscal year. We have high net expected at its for the next medium-term plan.ToyoOP topped guidance by &#x27;10bn in H1 (we estimate by &#x27;6bn in Q2). The sales mix improved thanks to strength in vehicle light-truck radial (WLTR) tires, while marine freight rates and the prices of fossil-fuel-based materials were positive. While management raised its full-year OP target &#x27;5.0bn, we think it is conservative in areas such as forecras, North American sales, marine freight rates, and auto parts. There were one-time costs in Q1 this fiscal year. We expect restructuring in Europe and China to bear fruit from IR onward.BridgestoneOP was in line with guidance in H1. Deterioration in Brazil and processed products was offset by cost-cutting and changes in forecras. The profitability of truck and business improved thanks to restructuring and a recovery in volumes. Management felt full-year guidance unchanged. The company aims to pass through tariffs via price hikes. We estimate that additional macro risk has declined from &#x27;20bn to &#x27;10bn. The benefits of efforts to strengthen first one will be key. We expect ongoing share buybacks.SumitomoQ2 earnings were in line if a deterioration in unrealized profit is excluded. The market&#x27;s current take is that Sumitomo Rubber is relatively unattractive as a second-tier brand with a role in product improvement in the US. At the same time, the company announced its new Project ARK cost-cutting program when reporting Q2 results. It targets total cost costs of &#x27;30bn by 2027. From 2026 all ramp-up will start of Dunlop products in developed markets. The company aims to boost the brand to improve competitiveness. We anticipate greater interest for focus on Sensing Cored technology via the new acquisition.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"—\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds \\(15\\%\\) against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation.

The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus. Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company (ies) referred to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company (ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. Statements and views concerning ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors are typically based upon public statement made by the affected company or other public news, which the author may not have independently verified. ESG factors are one consideration that investors may choose to examine when making investment decisions. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",
