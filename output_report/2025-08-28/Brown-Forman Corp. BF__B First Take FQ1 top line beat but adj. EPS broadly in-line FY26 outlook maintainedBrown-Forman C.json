      "text": "Our View - BF reported FQ1 organic nales growth that was up \\(+1\\%\\) , which was ahead of our/Visible Alpha Consensus Data estimates of \\(- 3.8\\%\\) , driven by very strong emerging markets growth of \\(+25\\%\\) (organic) and benefits from an increase in distributor inventories - which more than offset modest declines in the US (- 2% organic) and sharp developed international markets declines (- 9% organic). Stronger topline growth helped drive healthy gross margin expansion, though adj. EPS of \\(\\) 0.35\\((- 11\\% y / y)\\) was broadly in- line with cons ests ( \\(\\) 0.36\\(), but slightly below our\\) \\ \\(0.38\\) est. We note that the adj. EPS figure excludes the impact from \\(\\) 12M\\(in restructuring and other charges, as well as an\\) \\ \\(18M\\) benefit related to the collection of substitution drawback claims filed with the U.S. Government between fiscal 2016 & 2019. Drilling down, gross margins expanded \\~40bps y/y to 59.8% (vs our/cons ests of 60.0/59.3%), driven by the positive impact from acquisitions & divestitures - albeit partially offset by higher costs, unfavorable price/mix, and the negative effect of FX. We also point out that net changes in distributor inventories had a \\(+4\\% / + 10\\%\\) impact on organic net sales/op income in FQ1, with mgmt noting benefits from a net increase in distributor inventories positively impacted sales. Moving down the P&L, SG&A was down - 6%/- 7% on a reported/organic basis (vs our - 3.0% est) while ad spend was down - 4%/- 3% on a reported/organic basis (vs our - 0.9% y/y est) driving reported/organic operating profit growth of - 7%/+2% (vs our - 4.0% organic est). Adj. operating margins contracted \\~- 70bps y/y to 27.5%, vs our/VA cons ests of 28.3%/27.4%.",

      "text": "Looking ahead, despite the stronger than expected FQ1 results, mgmt maintained its FY26 guidance - which we think is prudent given it's still early in the year. The reaffirmed guidance continues to assume that both organic net sales and op income growth remain pressured, weighed by continued headwinds from global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. With that, mgmt expects FY26 organic net sales and operating profit growth of - LSD% (below mgmt's l.t. +MSD target on the topline and vs our/cons ests of - 2.3%/- 2.6%) - which taking into account the FQ1 results, implies - LSD declines throughout year- end. Ultimately, we think mgmt's guidance ranges could prove a bit challenging this year, especially given the implication that visibility remains low on category trends normalizing and the direction of the Spirits' consumer - which we expect to pressure the stock and weight on sentiment near- term. As such, we maintain our Sell rating.",

Globally, Jack Daniel's family of brands net sales was flat y/y in FQ1 (including flat organic). Similarly, mgmt noted that net sales for Whiskey products were also flat y/y (including flat organic) - due to strong initial shipments of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Blackberry (in preparation for the launch) and growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple in Brazil, offset by lower volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the US & Germany. Jack Daniel's RTD/RTP net sales declined \\(- 2\\%\\) y/y \\((- 1\\%\\) organic), as declines in Canada more than offset growth in the US.

Herradura's net sales declines were driven by lower volumes in the US as the tequila category remains competitive, per mgmt. Finally, the Travel Retail channel reported net sales growth of \\(+8\\%\\) (organic \\(+7\\%\\) ), driven by higher volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey & Gin Mare (partially due to the timing of shipments), as well as a positive FX impact.",

Key upside risks to our thesis include abating pricing competition in US whiskey resulting in an inflection in market share for Jack Daniel's, and/or significant acceleration in growth of non - Jack brands such as Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and its tequila brands. In addition, American whiskey is continuing to gain share in a number of markets outside the US including Germany, the UK, and Poland, which provides BF with a long runway for growth. BF is also the only scaled, publicly traded company with sizable exposure to whiskey, which could make it an attractive acquisition candidate for a larger spirits company looking to increase exposure to the important American whiskey segment, though we see a low likelihood of any deal given BF's family ownership and control structure - as the Brown Family controls the majority of BF's class A voting shares.",
