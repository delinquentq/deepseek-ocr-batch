Net profit of Rmb834mn grew higher (vs. Rmb- 393mn/Rmb298mn in 1H/2H24, or GSe Rmb299mn), attributed to 1) improving GPM of 86.0% (or 84.1% for product GPM, +185bp y/y) with increasing production volume coupled with ongoing optimization in manufacturing efficiency (140kL of manufacturing capacity in use), 2) lower- than- expected R&D spending of Rmb1bn (-28% y/y, vs. GSe Rmb1.35bn), which we view as temporary as eleven ph3 trials have either initiated in 1H or in planning, particularly the MRCT (e.g. ph3 in late- line sq- NSCLC/CRC for IB1363, ph3 in 3L PDAC/GC for IB1343), and 3) managed growth in SG&A spending of Rmb3.37bn (+29% y/y, vs. GSe Rmb3.47bn) with the expanding team in General Medicines (1,000 FTEs in commercial team). With non- IFRS EBITDA of Rmb1.4bn (or c.Rmb840mn excluding upfront payment from the DLL3 ADC deal), mgmt expect to have better bottom line performance for FY25 (vs. previous goal to reach EBITDA break- even), and we expect GAAP level profit of Rmb924mn for the full year.",

The trial is designed as a full- size ph3 MRCT in many aspects, with 1) IO- resistant squamous NSCLC as the target indication, for which IB1363 showed competitive efficacy across ORR/PFS/OS at ASCQ2025, 2) randomized controlled groups with IB1363 (3mg/kg Q3W, N=300) and docetaxel (75mg/m2 Q3W, N=300), 3) patient enrollment planned across major global regions, including China, US, Canada, EU, UK, and Japan, and 4) OS as the primary endpoint, and PFS/ORR/DOR as secondary endpoint.

The company has a deep pipeline of \\(30+\\) assets built via in- house R&D and collaboration with global partners, including commercialized products led by sintilimab (the leading PD- 1 inhibitor covering major indications in the NRDL). We believe Innovent will continue its leading position in China biotech with: 1) deep pipeline of novel molecules targeting next- generation I/O targets with encouraging preliminary data (e.g., IB1363 (PD- 1/IL2- bais BsAb) with a differentiated drug profile in IO- treated / cold tumors, IB1362 (GLP- 1/GCCR) with encouraging efficacy in obesity/diabetes); 2) strong commercialization capabilities as best demonstrated in the quick ramp- up of sintilimab; and 3) its deep collaboration with global partners, especially Eli Lilly. We consider Innovent as undervalued at current levels given the high value of market- implied WACC (12%) only reflecting the value of its de- risked indications and not fully pricing in its strong revenue and pipeline. We are Buy rated on the stock.

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
