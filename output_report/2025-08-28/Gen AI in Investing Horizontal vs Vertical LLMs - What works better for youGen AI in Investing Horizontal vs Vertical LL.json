      "text": "Our discussions with investors indicate most people are already leveraging AI tools on their personal devices for public data (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, etc.), while funds figure out enterprise solutions to maximize efficacy in investment research. We think enterprise- grade 'vertical LLMs' custom- built for financial research are better suited for the task than general- purpose AI tools (also called 'horizontal LLMs'). It is similar to vertical vs. horizontal SaaS. General- purpose vs. industry- tailored (but costlier) solutions. Industries with high stakes decision- making or niche use cases will gravitate towards vertical LLMs (investing, legal, pharma, etc.). We have hosted founders from different platforms that are building AI tools for investment research/ analysis (Pascal.ai, Kristal.ai, Needl.ai) showcasing their platforms and the use cases.",

Horizontal LLMs (HLLMs) are models designed for general use cases like simple querying, data gathering, etc. A \"jack of all trades but a master of none\" which can be used to help with work/school tasks and to generate art/stories for your children. Commonly used HLLMs include ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, DeepSeek, etc. (all private). Vertical LLMs (VLLMs), on the other hand, act as domain experts and are fine-tuned for specific use cases. They restrict themselves to a niche, allowing for deeper expertise on a particular domain. Examples include AlphaSense, Pascal.AI, Kristal.AI, Needl.AI (in financial research/analysis), Harvey (legal) and PathAI (healthcare).",

      "text": "2. What's the difference? Horizontal LLMs prioritize cross-domain functionality but lack the nuance and depth needed for extensive analysis and actionable insights. Common issues with HLLMs include accuracy (hallucinations) and generic outputs. Admittedly, this is not a major issue when used for day-to-day web-search, but it does matter when businesses want to make decisions based on their analysis (say an investment decision, or legal contracts, or drug research, etc.). Further, while HLLMs are getting better by the day, VLLMs leverage multiple HLLMs to maintain their edge. The challenge with VLLMs would be its scalability and higher costs as it would target a limited audience and may not do well on tasks outside the focus domain.",

Vertical LLMs win in investing: We think HLLMs are suited to be used by both businesses (limited to low impact decisions) and consumers, while VLLMs will be the go-to solution for enterprise decision-making where stakes involved are more significant (includes investment research). VLLMs can leverage the vast amount of internal research insights residing inside the research data and help build institutional research insights.",

If VLLMs are deployed properly, they can absorb heaps of data and help answer structured/unstructured research questions from public/enterprise data in a easy-to-use chatbot interface. We have previously highlighted what are the key use cases that investors can already leverage with these VLLMs (link).",

Use cases across industries (legal, pharma, defense): VLLMs are not only beneficial in sector of our concern but also play important roles in diverse fields including healthcare, legal, and defense, where their specialized applications address complex and sensitive challenges. Like in legal practices, Harvey (private), a VLLM is used for time-consuming tasks such as drafting, due-diligence & deal management. Several AI companies today operate in health space, such as PathAI (private), Tempus (not covered), Augmedix (not covered). All these AI companies are at the forefront of transforming healthcare by advancing precision medicine through large-scale clinical data analysis and enhancing diagnostic workflow, clinical decision support and patient care. In the defense space, companies like Anduril industries (private), Rebellion Defense (private) are applying AI driven automation for autonomous surveillance, drone operations and battlefield safety, reducing human risk and improving operation efficiency. The list does not stop here and going forward we expect VLLMs to chart territories which are currently unexplored.",

This complexity creates challenges in data annotation, particularly in understanding treatment backgrounds. Generative AI has been instrumental in addressing specific questions about treatment variations and prostate cancer biology. Public databases often lack annotation and group catatron- resistant prostate cancer as one entity when, in reality, it represents multiple different entities. As a clinical scientist, distinguishing these patient groups is crucial. Tempus's AI tools within Lens have significantly accelerated my research, enabling me to identify distinct patient subsets much faster than traditional methods.",

Unlike Dr. Posadas' focused cohort approach, we explore how generative AI can leverage larger real- world datasets. Traditionally, RWD analysis was limited by structured data and the cost of manual curation. Earlier NLP tools extracted single features. Generative AI now allows us to extract diverse features from unstructured text, maximizing information analysis. Through client collaborations, we've identified three key applications: identifying patients with rare cancers or complex clinical features, enriching data with previously uncurated features directly from unstructured data, and enabling detailed analysis of individual patients or small cohorts.",

By pairing gene expression with these timelines, which often include multiple samples per patient, we can correlate treatments with gene expression changes. While Lens' structured data provides valuable information, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of a patient's disease journey. That's where Patient Explorer, a feature within Lens that allows researchers and scientists to define and refine patient cohorts using a broad set of filters, comes in. It builds a data matrix for each patient based on physician notes, which I, as a PhD, don't typically review. For instance, I can input patient characteristics and query metastatic locations. Patient Explorer then provides an answer, citing relevant physician notes that would take me hours to sift through normally. I can now answer a question about 200 patients in five minutes. This allows me to identify patterns that I can then discuss with clinicians like Dr. Posadas, who can translate those patterns into clinically relevant insights.",

So, understanding the sequence of metastatic sites and related events offers insights into biological changes. This allows us to investigate if these signals were present at diagnosis or developed through treatments. This requires temporal analysis across the disease's natural history and contextualizing it with genomic information that is acquired throughout the disease's timeline. As Josh mentioned, this is a laborious manual process. However, Tempus' generative AI tools enable us to rapidly explore these variations. We can iteratively examine how specific events correlate with clinical outcomes, such as treatment benefits or metastasis patterns. This also allows us to analyze time- on- treatment variations. For example, we can compare treatment responses in patients with specific metastatic and gene expression patterns, which is incredibly unique and gives us a leg up by significantly accelerating our research.",
