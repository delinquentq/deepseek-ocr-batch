The two games combined increased in revenue contribution from 30% in 2024 to about 32.6% in 1H25. Flagship game Lords Mobile revenue (42.2% of total) declined by about 14.3% YoY to HKD1.15bn. Gross profit increased 4.7% YoY to HKD2.3bn and GPM expanded by 4pp to 83% due mainly to continued optimisation of operating cost and revenue contribution from app business. S&M expenses increased by 10% YoY to HKD1.3bn due mainly to increased marketing expense to enhance user acquisition and extend product life spans. Net income reached HKD325m (vs consensus at HKD312.5m and our estimate of HKD316m), of which the core game business generated about HKD344.4m and investment loss reached (HKD19.7m).",

The average retention rate is 30% with 40% in Japan.

It already demonstrated its organic appeal for certain marketsb) a survival game, developed over three years, is scheduled for launch in late November 2025; (3) App Business: Despite weaker 1H ad spend, Co accumulated users aggressively at lower cost. It expects an acceleration in 2H25 and MAU targets to exceed 100m in 2026; (4) Al application. Over 70% of ad creatives and 40% of video assets are Al- generated now. Co aims to integrate Al into game planning and coding for further cost savings and efficiency; (5) Co planned to invest around USD 30mn to promote Fate War in 2H25 with overall profitability to remain solid; (6) Headcount will stay steady in 2025, with plans to add around 200 people in Southeast Asia in 2026; (7) Shareholder return: The interim dividend declared, together with the share repurchase program, represented approximately 61% of the Group's 2025 interim net profit.",
