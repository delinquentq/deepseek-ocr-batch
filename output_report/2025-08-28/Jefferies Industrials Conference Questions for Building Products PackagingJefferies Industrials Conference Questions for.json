How much should we expect in cost and growth synergies over the next two years, and with EBITDA margins for the Meridian adhesive flooring business in the mid- to- high 20s, do you see further opportunities to invest around this platform?

How have you managed the business from a service level, pricing, and cost standpoint and have you been able to generate proper returns and margins? The US industry is set to take out nearly \\(9\\%\\) of containerboard capacity in 2025, which should push industry operating rates into the mid to high- 90s. I've never seen this industry run this tight before. How do you see pricing shaping up and does the industry have enough headroom if demand snaps back? Out of exports? The Greif acquisition seems like a great strategic fit. What are the biggest opportunities under your management where you can unlock from a growth or operational standpoint? With the Greif acquisition and internal continuous improvement efforts, how much runway do you have from a capacity standpoint? What are some avenues to unlock capacity before a major capital investment is required? What type of options do you have internally for further conversions - is Ifalls an option or it's mostly greenfield at this point? Two of your largest competitors with new leadership are now taking more of a value of volume approach. Is this a rising tide lifts all boats situation? You've heavily invested in your box network over the years, which gives you a formidable moat as your competitors play catch up. Does it give you a much lower cost structure and specialty box capacity, where you have the ability to bid for jobs they frankly don't have capability to service?",
