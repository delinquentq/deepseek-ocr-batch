The article labels Mr Ebner as a \"feared activist investor\". Although the article makes no mention of his intentions for Vodafone, the article suggests he has not aggressively pushed for changes, and has taken a less hands on approach in some of his recent investments. We note that Vodafone has a history of attracting activist investors - In the past few years, Cevian Capital, Elliott, Xavier Niel, Liberty Global and E& have historically taken material stakes in Vodafone, often making calls for strategic change, typically with limited impact, although we note that Vodafone did pivot its M&A strategy and changed leadership 2- 3 years ago, selling Spain and Italy in an attempt to reposition the strategy. Liberty Global has recently disposed of its Vodafone stake. Source: Telegraph (27 August 2025)",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
