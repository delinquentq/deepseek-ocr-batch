The message? The group needed to demolish its aging Los Colorados concentrator to be able to access a higher grade part of the ore body. This process would lead to a (large) dip in production to c. 750 ktpa. The group has now reconsidered its options and will run the Los Colorados concentrator for longer, which effectively removes this dip in production. We are slightly baffled that the company couldn't come to this conclusion before it hosted its site visit.",

In our view, this is unsurprising given the trade tensions that have since unfolded. Biggest change is for US flat product demand (now see \\(- 2\\%\\) to flat vs \\(+1 - 3\\%\\) prior). MT estimates German Infrastructure Fund adding \\(+1.5 - 2\\%\\) to annual steel demand in Europe. Similar to industry peers, MT believes an effective CBAM (cross border adjustment mechanism)/ safeguard replacement could be the catalyst needed for Europe to move up from cyclical lows. As such, next 12 months could be catalyst rich. An effective CBAM needs (at a minimum) to address 1) circumvention, 2) export rebates and 3) steel derivate product inclusion (e.g. auto, machinery).",

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least \\(10\\%\\) and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0- 12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).",
