      "text": "Our Take: Pernod Ricard has delivered a \\(5\\%\\) beat on FY25 EPS driven by better margin. Q424 organic sales at \\(- 0.3\\%\\) was slightly ahead of consensus \\((- 0.8\\%)\\) thanks to stronger Europe and Asia (ex. China & India), partly offset by a miss in the US at c. \\(- 12\\%\\) (vs cons \\(- 8.9\\%\\) ) impacted by a slower than expected improvement in sell- out. India \\(+\\) low- teens% (cons. \\(+14.5\\%\\) ) and China declining high- teens (vs cons \\(- 14.3\\%\\) ) were also below. Q4 beat was driven by slightly better Europe \\(+1.5\\%\\) vs cons. \\(+1.1\\%\\) (helped by growth in France and E. Europe), rest of Asia (notably Australia) and GTR - LDD (cons. \\(- 16.6\\%\\) ). For FY25, organic EBIT growth beat at \\(- 0.8\\%\\) (vs \\(- 3.1\\%\\) ) cons) with EBIT of €2,951m \\(3\\%\\) ahead of consensus on better gross margin delivery (COGS efficiencies) and structural cost savings \\((- 4\\%\\) yoy). Leverage at end FY25 was in line at \\(3.3x\\) (cons \\(3.3x\\) ) while FCF was better than expected at €1,133m (cons. €995m). Looking ahead to FY26, management expects a transition year with \"improving trends\" in organic sales skewed to H2 (cons. \\(+0.5\\%\\) ) and to \"defend our organic operating margin to the fullest extent possible\" (cons - 20bps). Management expects a decline in Q1 (cons. \\(- 0.4\\%\\) ) with distributor inventory adjustment in the US, continued soft consumer demand and inventory adjustment in China and the impact of Maharashtra excise policy changes in India though noting Duty Free China resuming from Q2. Next, despite the beat we would expect limited changes to FY26 consensus EPS on lower organic sales/ EBIT26 growth given softer H1 sales outlook, higher FX headwinds and scope impact. Overall, a mixed picture with a welcome earnings beat but clearly a much weaker set up into H126 (with Q126 possibly down \\(3\\% +\\) ) and expectations that RI could guide to LSD% organic EBIT for FY26 post Diageo outlook. While we would expect the shares to be supported by today's beat, this may be tough to sustain post a c17% rally from June lows and now trading on 16x PE26E.",

While we appreciate the company's LT opportunity to drive both top line and margin and the shares are now trading at a discount to the sector, we expect the shares to be held back in the near term by downside risks to earnings and the limitations of high leverage currently.",

Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.",
