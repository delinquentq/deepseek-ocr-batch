The rally has manifested against a backdrop where macro statistics are showing signs of cyclical softness and consensus profit revisions are muted, prompting investor questions about the durability of this liquidity- driven rally. We note that \"liquidity\" has boosted equity returns globally, and with (i) China equity multiples at mid- range levels, (ii) trend profit growth running at high- single- digit pace, (iii) A- share retail risk appetite only moderately above neutral territory on our measures, (iv) far- from- extended fund positioning across investor types, and (v) strong potential for asset reallocation flows to equities, we believe the uptrend has legs notwithstanding near- term profit taking pressures. Key risks are abrupt market liquidity tightening, regulation shocks, and macro policy disappointments, which have tended to derail most flow- powered equity booms historically. We stay overweight China Offshore and A shares in a regional context, forecast \\(10\\%\\) \\(12m\\) returns for MSCI China (90) and \\(12\\%\\) for CSI300 per our improved index target for the latter (4,900), but reiterate our alpha- over- beta bias to trade for better risk/reward.",

Our economists expect that, with the full-year official growth target of around \\(5\\%\\) more or less within reach, sequential growth slowdown is going to prevail in the remainder of 2025 considering the likely payback of front-loading exports and the lack of (and low urgency for) aggressive and large-scaled policy stimulus. In the listed universe, consensus earnings revision trends have stalled in recent months, consistent with the broadly pedestrian 2Q/1H earnings results so far in this reporting season.

We ascribe the valuation recovery to a number of policy (related) events and positive catalysts that have materialized in the past year, namely the policy pivot in September last year that took out the left-tail risks in Chinese equities, the \"DeepSeek Moment\" in late January that has rewritten the AI/Tech narrative for China, the POE Symposium in February which suggested that the regulatory tightening towards the private economy is probably over, the de-escalation of US-China trade tensions since late April, and the CCFEA meeting in early July where President Xi called for more rational competition, and the anti-involution rhetoric has triggered a reflation trade in the financial markets. In our view, the common trait of these events is that they are helpful in compressing equity/policy risk premium and shoring up forward earnings expectations, although the immediate earnings impacts are likely limited.",
