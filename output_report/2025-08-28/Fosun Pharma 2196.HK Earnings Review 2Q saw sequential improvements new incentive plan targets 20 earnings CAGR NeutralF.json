Pharmaceutical segment sales were down by \\(- 8\\%\\) y/y in 1H, as new drug sales \\((+14\\%)\\) y/y in 1H) were not enough to offset the erosion of large generic portfolio impacted by VBP. Device business \\((- 6.7\\%)\\) y/y) also stayed soft, with weak sales from capital medical equipment and aesthetic devices in the US market. Despite the weak topline, 2Q earnings (Rmb937mn, \\(+52\\%\\) y/y) beat, with one- off gains from the sale of equity for non- core asset United Family Hospital. Excluding one- offs, earnings declined by \\(- 15\\%\\) y/y due to consolidation of loss- making CART subsidiary Fosun Kairos and lower profits contribution from associates including Sinopharm (earnings \\(- 12\\%\\) y/y in 2Q).
