Revenue came in at RMB51bn, up \\(4.2\\%\\) YoY but \\(8\\%\\) below our estimate, due to lower- than- expected ASP (domestic ASP - \\(6\\%\\) YoY; export - \\(5\\%\\) YoY). GPM read \\(15.1\\%\\) , up 0.4ppt YoY/up 0.4ppt HoH, mainly on the company's cost- saving measures, such as centralized procurement and increasing self- supply ratio. OPEX- to- sales came in at \\(8.1\\%\\) , up slightly from \\(7.9\\%\\) in 1H24 and higher than our estimate of \\(7.9\\%\\) . Net profit was RMB3.4bn, up \\(4\\%\\) YoY, in line with our estimate. In 1H25, Sinotruk sold \\(68k / 69k\\) units of HDT in domestic/overseas markets, up \\(19\\% /1\\%\\) YoY, vs the industry sales of \\(9\\% /3\\%\\) YoY.

For the exports market, management targets 150k units in 2025 vs 134k units in 2024. Sinotruk is positive on the export outlook in Africa & Southeast Asia. Sinotruk will also focus on the aftermarket and marketing in LatAm to expand sales and gain share, given its limited market share in the region.
