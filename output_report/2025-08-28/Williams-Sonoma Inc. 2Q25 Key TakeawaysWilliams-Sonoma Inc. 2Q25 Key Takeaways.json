Q2 GM upside was impressive but also included a timing mismatch (higher retail prices vs. pre- tariff inventory) that should not be fully extrapolated; we expect that will start to reverse in Q3 and reverse further in Q4, with higher costs in theory wrapping into FY26. WSM may have some offsets but additional changes to tariffs are looming, likely creating further uncertainty. As such, our full- year estimates are unchanged, and we remain EW as we balance strong execution and better than average financial visibility within this group, while monitoring for evidence that EPS can grow more meaningfully in FY26.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
