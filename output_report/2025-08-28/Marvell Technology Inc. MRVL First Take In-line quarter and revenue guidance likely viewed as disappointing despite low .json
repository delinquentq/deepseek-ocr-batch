      "text": "Key stock takeaways: We expect the stock to trade lower following an in- line quarter with guidance that was in line with the Street on revenue, but modestly above on margins and EPS. We believe investor expectations were low heading into the quarter and positioning was likely cautious; however, we believe the lack of revenue upside in guidance reflects a lack of near- term traction for Al Datacenter products. From here, we believe stock performance is likely to hinge on the magnitude of Marvell's custom compute ramp in 2H and 2026. On the conference call, we expect investors to focus on: (1) the shape of Marvell's custom compute revenue ramp in 2H; (2) commentary on share at AWS for Trainium 3 and Trainium 4; (3) incremental details on Microsoft's Maia ramp in 2H26; (4) the pace of recovery for Marvell's traditional business.",
