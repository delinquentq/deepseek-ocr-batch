We remain positive on the company's expansion in the automotive SiC, new energy and home appliance markets. Despite volume growth in multiple end markets (e.g. automotive, PV and home appliance), we remain cautious on overall pricing pressure, competition, and higher depreciation (due to Starpower's investment in its in- house production line).
