However, bond yield is \\(\\sim 40bp\\) inside the B- Index market (6.3% versus 6.7%) after significant outperformance since early '24. The less compelling valuation backdrop is coupled with our view that 1) rating upside is constrained (given limited banner diversity and '25 earnings headwinds), 2) EBITDA will still be down -15% in '25, despite brand traction, and 3) lingering tariff headwinds present risk to 2H earnings, leaving far few catalysts or drivers of spread compression near term.",

While we are pleased to see higher sales guidance and improvement versus the prior quarter, the margin outlook was disappointing as the expected tariff headwind doubled compared to earlier guidance. 2Q adjusted operating income, while above the prior guidance range, was still down YoY, and the unchanged FY25 operating income guidance despite the higher sales guide further reflects this margin pressure. Direct sales trends were mixed—down in the quarter but slightly up for the full year—while international operations showed strength with sales up double digits. Overall, we view the sales trends as encouraging, though profitability remains pressured by the increased tariff impact.",
