By using z- scored values, we are able to identify companies that are above or below their cohort mean. If any of the 4 metrics are missing for a company, the z- score for that metric is set to 0. Companies that rank the highest within their cohort will have the largest z- score and the those that rank the lowest will have the smallest (i.e. negative) z- score. Companies with the highest (lowest) z- scores across all 4 metrics will have the highest (lowest) HER Score. In Japan, we z- scored the equal weighted average of the raw metrics of representation by sector.
