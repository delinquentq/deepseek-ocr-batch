We are constructive on HG Tech given its expansion into high- end optical transceivers (800G and 400G modules), which should drive margin improvement and accelerate net profit growth in 2026E- 27E. Current valuations are at the lower end of its historical trading range on 2025E P/E, which we view as attractive. Going forward, a key catalyst will be HG Tech's 800G and 400G ramp progress and profitability improvement. We are Buy rated on HG Tech.",
