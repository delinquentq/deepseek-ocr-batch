There have been challenges in the past, as hopes for China demand have not materialized, and supply growth has been volatile - we see a different path going forward. Supply growth now comes on a much bigger base, so HSD swings in supply growth are no longer possible, and even with all shipyards working at capacity we still expect a mid- low single digit supply growth outlook. Cruise is also a more American product, and the large cruise companies have no plan to ramp in Asia, focusing growth on more stable core US and European markets.",

We expect a supply growth CAGR in the LSD after retirements - as a result cruise could lose share of overall lodging and still meet supply growth. However, with the cruise product widening its appeal, as new ships become desirable destinations in and of themselves, and private islands add exclusive content only accessible via a cruise, we expect the product will appeal to a wider audience. Given cruises core appeal is to an older population, an aging global population will also act as a tailwind to demand growth, driving robust industry yield growth.",
