Zim's 2Q rates and volume dynamics were relatively poorer vs. Hapag- Lloyd and Maersk due to its higher TP exposure. ZIM's rates were down \\(17\\%\\) QoQ vs Maersk/HLAG down \\(7\\% /11\\%\\) . In 2Q25, Volumes were down by \\(6\\%\\) yoy, vs. BarcE \\(+2\\%\\) (1Q25 \\(+12\\%\\) , Maersk and Hapag- Lloyd 2Q volumes \\(+4\\%\\) and \\(+12\\%\\) yoy, respectively). Looking into 2H, we see the biggest risks to volumes coming from weaker US demand due to front- loading from US shippers in 1H and potentially a weaker US consumer impacted by inflationary pressures. ZIM is the most at risk with regard to this US 2H risk. In addition, ZIM will also face more challenging comps from 2H24. Management commented that ZIM benefited from very strong volume growth in 2H24, beating records in 3Q and 4Q from a carried quantity perspective.",

A lot of unclarity remains on the demand environment in the 2H, subject to tariffs and macro risk.

At 2Q25, management noted that market fundamentals still point to supply growth outpacing demand going forward; however, RS and Port disruptions are causing a temporary effective shortage of supply. Has management's view on environmental- led scrapping changed following the IMO proposed mid- term measure announcements in April? Is there global capacity for scrapping and what is the lead time for scrapping? How does the newly adopted Hong Kong convention impact the overall capacity? How much capacity can slow steaming absorb in FY25? How slow can vessels sail? How long will it take within the industry for structural repair to emerge? What would be the first signs? Increase in blank sailings or scrapping? How much capacity can be absorbed by low- speed sailing? Are scrapping and slow steaming enough to support freight rates even if demand does not pick up? If, on the other hand, demand picks up, and global trade activity regains its relationship with global GDP growth, can that pick- up be enough to avoid oversupply risks? Won't all players just chase these volumes and put further pressure on rates?",

During the 2Q conference call, management stated that the overall cost structure of the industry and of ZIM has gone up when compared to pre- Covid levels, incl. wages, charter costs, bunker costs, etc. What are the incremental opportunities to reduce unit costs from here? What level of asset utilisation is needed to continue improving unit costs sequentially? How should the market expect the non- bunker unit fuel costs to evolve?
