Currently, Suezmaxes are the best performing tanker asset in the spot market with non-eco Suezmaxes averaging over &#36;50,000/day and the ytd average just below &#36;40,000/day. NAT's fleet age stands at 11.5 years, though 5 of its vessels are above the age of 20. We expect NAT to continue to renew its fleet, similar to its latest moves with the outgoing Nordic Castor (2004-built) and the Nordic Apollo (2003-built, sold in 1Q) having been replaced by the Nordic Moon and Nordic Galaxy, both of which are 2016-built. As NAT refines its fleet, we expect its realized TCE rate averages to improve. We are modeling a fleet-wide TCE average of &#36;30,000/day for 3Q, bringing our EPS to &#36;0.02.",

The tanker market is highly volatile, with spot rates changing on an ongoing daily and intraday basis due to tanker vessel supply and charterer demand changes. The sector is dependent on seaborne oil volumes, which historically are driven by OPEC and non- OPEC production. Should higher and/or lower oil volumes come to market, they could have a materially upward or downward impact on charter rates. Tanker newbuilding and secondhand prices are driven by charter rates and shipyard construction costs, with changes in steel and labor major factors in overall costs. Higher interest rates typically are associated with declining ship values while lower interest rates could lead to higher values. The changes in ship values, therefore, impact the balance sheet and various leverage ratios.",
