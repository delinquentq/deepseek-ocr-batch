As a key beneficiary of the re- opening of the world post- COVID, the airline's traffic capacity returned to \\(100\\%\\) of pre- COVID levels in FY25, with the airline's earnings capacity (EPS) exceeding that of pre- COVID levels by \\(\\sim 92\\%\\) . We believe that QAN's earnings capacity has been sustainably improved relative to pre- COVID, which provides a solid foundation for QAN's next stage of growth, with recent FY25 result reflecting upside associated with initial deliveries from QAN's fleet renewal program. Despite this, QAN is trading at a discount vs regional and US peers and at lower PE vs pre- COVID. Downside risks include: Slower- than- expected traffic and capacity growth given the uncertainty around fleet delivery, structurally reduced travel demand post- put- up post- pandemic demand, irrational market pricing leading to lower- than- expected yields/RASK, higher- than- expected fuel prices (with lower- than- expected pass- through) and unfavourable FX, lower- than- expected cost- out (net of inflation).",
