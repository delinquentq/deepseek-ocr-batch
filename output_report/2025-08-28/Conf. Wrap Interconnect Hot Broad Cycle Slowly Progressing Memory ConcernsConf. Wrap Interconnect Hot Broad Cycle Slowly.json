In SPE, AMAT did seem to be more of an anomaly with others not pointing to China weakness. LRCX sounded very confident in its competitive position with drivers such as Moly but it's hard to avoid the Memory overhang for the group. Mobile seemed a bit lackluster with the Android market likely softer into the end of the year and not much excitement for the IP17. Finally, Memory is the area where investors were the most negative as there are fears that a Samsung HBM qualification (which the market is viewing as increasingly likely) would likely cause an oversupply and NAND fears circle around a softer demand profile pushing pricing lower.
