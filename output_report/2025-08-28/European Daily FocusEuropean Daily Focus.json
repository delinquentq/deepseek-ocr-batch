Completion of the deal with BPSO strengthens our Buy on BPER - The offer for BP Sondrio (BPSO) reached \\(81\\%\\) acceptance, with final integration planned by 1H26. We reiterate our Buy recommendation on BPER, upgrading the target price to EUR 12.1 p/s. We estimate room to exceed CET1 guidance at year- end \\((>15\\%)\\) and the 2027 net profit target of \\(>EUR2bn\\) . The stronger franchise post- merger should justify a re- rating from the current 2026- 27E adj. P/E of 8.5- 7.8x. The deal accelerates BPER's growth, with the EPS CAGR increasing from \\(2\\%\\) to \\(6\\%\\) . Lombardy's dominance drives BPER's growth - BPER's acquisition of BPSO is strategically sound due to geographical and business complementarity, enhancing BPER's position in Lombardy.

Yet he's got a wealth of experience at EMCGs (o/w 20 years at Danone) and his experience may be additive to the culture which has delivered structural growth for the business.

The summary is that with GMAB profitable and set to generate its €15bn market cap in derisked, cumulative FCF + the c\\\\$3bn on the balance sheet by the end of the decade, we still think there is ample scope for the company to restore further equity value by enhancing confidence over Darzalex replacement prospects from Epkintly, Rina- S and the remaining pipeline (acasunlimab prospects remain TBD, in our view...).

We expect the trend towards larger and more productive companies with better- paid employees to continue. We also anticipate a further increase in the proportion of companies acting as developers, while the proportion of private households decreases. We maintain our assessment from previous years that even fewer detached houses will be built in the future. The trend towards larger buildings with smaller apartments is likely to persist, primarily due to the housing shortage in metropolitan areas. Prefabricated construction has already gained significant importance in recent years. The high degree of prefabrication offers a clear advantage over conventional, individualized construction. It is likely to enable the rapid integration of new technologies such as digitalization, robotics, and 3D printing. As a result, we expect higher capital intensity and increased productivity. Both of these should contribute to lowering construction costs in the long term.",

First, the market is already pricing a lot of risk premium, as argued by our fixed income colleagues. OATs are now trading cheap on all their valuation metrics and already pricing in rating downgrades (chart 1). Second, despite a very weak government, budget execution this year has been remarkably positive and in line with what would be expected to meet the government's budget deficit target. Third, in the event of the government collapsing, it is not clear to us that the alternative that emerges would be worse than the current status quo.

We left with a much better understanding of just how complex, disciplined, and deliberate the sequencing of construction activities are to allow for the simultaneous commissioning and construction work that occurs at these projects. While Venture Global is best known for its approach in using factory- built, mid- scale liquefaction trains, we think that this barely scratches the surface of how the Company is differentiating its simultaneous commissioning and construction process.",

But even as US equities reached new heights, there were still plenty of doubts swirling in the background that took some of the shine off that. First were the ongoing questions about the Fed's independence, which led investors to price in faster inflation and drove a fresh round of yield curve steepening. Second, French bonds remained under pressure given the fiscal trajectory there, with the Franco- German 10yr spread up to a 7- month high of 82bps. And after the US close, Nvidia's share price fell in after- hours trading, as their results added to the sense that the explosive growth seen during the AI boom of 2023- 24 was decelerating. So US equity futures have also fallen a bit this morning, with those on the S&P 500 down - 0.12%.",

Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/), and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high- conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near- term or medium- term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12- month view of total return or investment return as described herein.

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Unlike an actual performance record based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.",

      "text": "The method for computing individual E,S,G and composite ESG scores set forth herein is a novel method developed by the Research department within Deutsche Bank AG, computed using a systematic approach without human intervention. Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within the Deutsche Bank Group. Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in research reports published by Deutsche Bank AG. Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of Deutsche Bank AG. It should be noted that the decision to incorporate ESG factors into any investment strategy may inhibit the ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with your investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.",
