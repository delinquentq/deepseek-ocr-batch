We view the early PowerFlex wins as positive, given the Dell PowerFlex solution is more tailored for the top end of the customer pyramid. Notably, these wins also came in ahead of internal expectations, given these customer types tend to be fairly conservative. These wins allow NTNX the opportunity to expand within the customer over time. Management expects to get more wins over the year as well. In regards to the previously announced PSTG partnership, NTNX continues to expect the offering to be generally available by end of CY25. PSTG has a broader footprint than PowerFlex, and we expect this to begin contributing to revenue in late FY26. We expect to continue to see new logo win momentum in FY26 with VMW share gains continuing to be a multi- year theme (management views they are in the second inning at this point) - NTNX has added 2,700 customers over the last year, but there are still \\(\\sim 200k\\) customers out there for VMW.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
