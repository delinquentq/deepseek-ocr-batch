EU TTF Month Ahead gas closed -4% at €31/MWh- Oil Markets Weekly: Tariffs on India kick in—Russian oil flows likely to continue at limited discounts (research available). Despite higher tariffs, India continues to buy Russian crude at reduced levels, a trend likely to persist until a trade deal is finalized and Russia maintains discounts. Russia has successfully redirected the 0.5 mbd drop in Indian exports but is unlikely to offer discounts beyond the current \\(2.60 / bbl\\), preferring to cut production over providing the deep discounts seen in 2022. With only 0.2 mbd of this being shipped to the EU, India should face no issues in complying with EU third-country intermediaries restrictions. India operates within global policy frameworks, with Russia bearing the responsibility for delivery- US Gas Weekly & Storage Recap: Early-view week ending August 29, 2025: +51 Bcf (research available). Yday's EIA print once more came in below market expectations, which called for a build in the high 20s Bcf but was relatively in line with our supply-demand forecast calling for a 21 Bcf injection. This and last week's EIA print corroborate strong weather-aided demand. Our preliminary storage injection estimate for the week ending August 22 is 51 Bcf. Beyond the forecast injection for the week in progress, decidedly more shoulder season injections are on the horizon as cooling load dissipates both seasonally and on current weather forecasts",

We also note that EIA 930 data point to lower week-over-week coal-fired power generation more in line with levels last seen in May and June (Figure 2). Pipeline data suggest that production is up week-over-week, and we have built in a 0.6 Bcf/day week-over-week increase versus the reference week. The Pacific region storage sample is showing a higher week-over-week withdrawal compared to the reference week. EIA 930 data for CAISO through yesterday show a 1 Bcf/day increase week-over-week in power burn for the region.

However, combined with comments and \"sources\" articles since then, the impression remains that the ECB will be on hold in September and that it needs a push to ease after that. We continue to expect one more cut (in October), but this requires some combination of downside risks to growth and/or a refocusing by the ECB on an inflation forecast that is already running below target despite having further easing factored in. That puts the focus on the next round of PMI surveys and upcoming inflation reports, starting with tomorrow's national releases for August, which we think will show soft core inflation momentum.",
