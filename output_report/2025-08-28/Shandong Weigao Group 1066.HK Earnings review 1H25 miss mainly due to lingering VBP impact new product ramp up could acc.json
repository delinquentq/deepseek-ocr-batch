Margin pressure was notable, driven by the prolonged impact of VBP on general consumables and pre- filled flush, and increased marketing expenses related to the launch of new vascular intervention products. R&D expense rose to Rmb316mn, accounting for 4.7% of revenue, up from 1H24 levels at 4.5%, reflecting the company's growing commitment to innovation with over 100 products currently under development. Foreign exchange losses, particularly in 2Q due to USD depreciation, resulted in a swing from Rmb20mn gain last year to Rmb40- 50mn loss this year. Operationally, OCF amounted to Rmb882mn, 14% lower than 1H24 due to 1) collections from direct sale channel were delayed by around Rmb100mn, while 2) strategic procurement efforts shortened supplier payment terms by Rmb140mn.

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
