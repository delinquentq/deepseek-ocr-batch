These activity dynamics are likely to be supportive for the credit operations of ICG (OW) and CVC (OW). Alongside the greater CLO activity, investment deal activity by value was significantly higher month on month (see Figure 18) although deal volume remains subdued; the same was the case for exit activity which was also sharply higher month on month (see Figure 19) despite similar deal counts levels. With this supportive market data, the upcoming reporting from Partners Group (OW) and CVC is likely to provide some incremental commentary on the outlook here for the coming months.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
