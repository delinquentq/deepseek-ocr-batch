We expect relatively low growth for Japan- made equipment as investment accelerates and production is localized in China.

By application, SEMI expects foundry and logic to remain the largest segments, accounting for \\(>60\\%\\) of the market in 2025 onward; it expects memory equipment demand to recover. Advantest is the global leader in inspection equipment, for which SEMI expects high growth in 2025.

Corresponding figures for 2026 are \\(+5\\%\\) and \\(+15\\%\\) . We anticipate that growth in demand for Japanese- made back- end equipment will outpace that for front- end equipment in 2025- 26, for the following reasons. We believe China's ambitions to domestically produce back- end equipment are not as strong as they are for front- end equipment, and we also think that back- end equipment stands to benefit relatively more from increased AI- related investment.",
