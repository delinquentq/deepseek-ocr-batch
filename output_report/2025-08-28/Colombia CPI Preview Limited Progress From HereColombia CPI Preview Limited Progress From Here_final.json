Headline inflation was mainly driven to the upside by food - fresh fruits \\((+4\\) bp), onions \\((+2.7\\) bp) - and rents, both effective and imputed, which combined added \\(\\sim 7\\) bp to total inflation. For the case of rents, we continue seeing some deceleration from \\(0.45\\%\\) last year to \\(0.32\\%\\) , but it continues to be high relative to historical standards. For its part, food prices increased \\(0.82\\%\\) m- o- m well above historical standards and was the largest overall contribution. This is likely explained by the strike of rice producers during July, affecting non- durables. In annual terms, headline inflation is running at \\(4.9\\%\\) y- o- y, below the \\(5.0\\%\\) mark and core remained stable at \\(4.79\\%\\) y- o- y (June: \\(4.77\\%\\) y- o- y).",

First, we will be looking for more generalized signs of pass- through, which we saw in the July print in some tradeables such as cars and clothing, among others. Second, the behavior of rents continues to be high and we expect it to be an important driver of inflation. Third, we will be expecting some payback in food prices after the rice producer strike, especially in perishables. Finally, more in the medium term we will remain vigilant regarding, i- forthcoming minimum wage increases, which has been mentioned several times by BanRep as an upside risk to inflation and also ii) the increasing dependence on imported gas prices, which is likely going to put upward pressure on headthe inflation.",

The reason we think that progress will be limited this year is that rents are likely to continue adding inflation stickiness.
