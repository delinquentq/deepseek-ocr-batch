The stock was up ~11% in the aftermarket.

In fact given the recent strength at the hyperscalers and MongoDB it would seem that the headwinds from Al seen especially last year have abated.",

We have previously written that CY24 was a tough year for software as IT had to focus on Gen AI but was, in most cases, not given additional funding or resources to build their competency in Gen AI. Therefore, IT delayed projects, optimized usage (which we saw at Snowflake and the hyperscalers) and put their top internal resources on building expertise in Gen AI. That caused many platform vendors and especially Cloud platform vendors, including Snowflake, Microsoft and MongoDB, to see revenue deceleration in CY24. Budgets improved in CY25 and we believe many organizations both received additional, and maybe even incremental budgets for Gen AI. This year we have seen a return to Cloud projects and Cloud migrations (which Microsoft management called out on their last earnings call). This helped Snowflake but the question is whether we are just seeing the spending that should have been captured last year captured this year or if this is sustainable.",
