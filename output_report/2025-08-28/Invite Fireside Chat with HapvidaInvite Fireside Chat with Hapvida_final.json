Additionally, according to Hapvida 2025 Reference Form (pages 120, 121 and 229 to 236), the independent auditors identified material weaknesses in the company internal controls during 2023 and 2024. In 2023, these included: (i) absence of a robust model for expected credit losses, and (ii) deficiencies in goodwill impairment testing. In 2024, auditors wrote a \"Report of recommendations for improving internal controls\". There, auditors (i) required prior-period errors restatements; (ii) verified a reconciliation backlog of BRL\\\\$483 million in December 2024 - later reduced to BRL\\\\$26.7 million; and (iii) noticed significant challenges implementing IFRS 17, including a) lack of data governance, b) undocumented system changes, and c) absence of formal accounting policies and critical assumptions. Management committed to resolving all remaining issues by 31 December 2025. Hapvida changed its auditing firm to Deloitte in November 2024; they claimed PwC would be responsible for cybersecurity, thus it is not recommended to perform the general auditing.",
