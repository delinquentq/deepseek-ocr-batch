At the July Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM), the number of board members who viewed downside risks to both the economy and prices had decreased. However, Gov. Ueda reemphasized his cautious stance during the post- MPM press conference. Thus attention to each member's individual policy stance is likely to grow ahead. In the near term, a speech by Dep. Gov. Himino is scheduled for September 2.",

For example, she first pointed out a risk that \"if firms, in response to tariff policies, have to focus much more on cost cutting over passing on cost increases to selling prices, moves to reflect price rises in wages could weaken.\" That said, there were also comments potentially indicating policy implications on underlying inflation trends, e.g., using the distribution of item- level CPI price changes, and Nakagawa noted that \"The tails of the distribution have been extended upward, and the simple median has been at around 2 percent.\" She also emphasized the importance of the Sep Boj Tankan.",

Ueda stated, \"we want to observe how tariff policies affect hard data such as exports, production, and employment in the US,\" and \"we believe the global economy, including Japan, is heading toward a slowdown, and we want to assess the extent of that deceleration given the high uncertainty.\" However, in today's Nakagawa's speech, updates to the Boj's views on the global economic outlook were relatively limited. Going forward, attention would be paid to upcoming Boj communications, including speeches by board members, e.g., for examining the Boj's internal views on the US economic outlook.",
