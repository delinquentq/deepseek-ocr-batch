We prefer KION (Buy) for exposure to Warehouse Automation (see our latest note here). AutoStore trades at c16x EV/EBITA FY2 a c10% discount to its historical average but we see the lack of detail on the new sales model weighing on investor sentiment. We raise our EBIT 2026/27E by c10% on a lower AaaS share than previously expected and now value AutoStore in line with quality (previously) 20% discount) peers given the company's high margin profile and first signs of an improvement in US warehouse automation demand.

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least \\(10\\%\\) and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0- 12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).",
