Some of the key overarching themes that we heard from companies were consistent were what we heard on day 1 (strong cloud/DC and A&D end demand trends, mixed auto, customer buying behavior normalizing despite tariff uncertainty, importance of HDD, etc.). Themes we heard from day 2 include: 1) Uneven Federal/Public Sector Spending Backdrop: Defense/public safety related spending remains strong though spending in civilian agencies has been weaker. 2) PC Market Strength Driven by Windows 11 Upgrades: Device refresh related to Windows 11 has been a driver of PC market strength and AI PCs could extend the cycle for longer. 3) Enterprise IT Spending Remains Positive with broad- based growth across product categories while SMB spending is more targeted (cloud, devices). 4) Spending on networking should grow as the industry transitions past inventory digestion.",
