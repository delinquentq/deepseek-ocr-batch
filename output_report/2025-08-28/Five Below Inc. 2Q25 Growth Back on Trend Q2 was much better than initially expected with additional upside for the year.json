We raise our estimates.  \n\n\nIncremental takes included: 1) Results confirmed strong sales momentum that was largely traffic (conversion) driven, which was broad based across categories and reflected numerous initiatives gaining traction; 2) Comps guidance of \\(+5 - 7\\%\\) for Q3 implies momentum has continued (implies 2 year in line to better than Q2). Q4 implied comps guidance +LSD seems conservative; 3) Elasticity from price increases trending better (improved through Q2 and into Q3), supporting positive revision to Q3 tariff math; extrapolating this into 2H will be a debate, but we note that Q4 guidance was not changed (i.e. GM still - 225 bps); we can get to FY25 EPS \\(\\) 5.50+\\(; 4) Related, FIVE implied that current price changes have been enough to cover current tariffs, supporting balanced transactions and ticket growth through 2H; 5) But no conclusion to tariff saga yet; there is still plenty of uncertainty, and our sense is that guidance only reflects India tariffs at 25% (vs. current 50%), while China may also still increase in November; so much can change but this is something to consider for FY26 (likely less of an issue for FY25).  \n\n\nAdjusting estimates: We raise Q3 comps to \\(+6\\%\\) from \\(+1\\%\\) and Adj. EPS to \\(\\) 0.19\\(from\\) \\ \\(0.01\\) , on the guidance commentary. For FY25, we raise comps to \\(+7\\%\\) from \\(+5\\%\\) and Adj. EPS to \\(\\) 5.07\\(from\\) \\ \\(4.72\\) , on the better than expected Q2 results and higher Q3 guidance. For FY26, we maintain comps of \\(+2.5\\%\\) but raise Adj. EPS to \\(\\) 5.33\\(from\\) \\ \\(5.00\\) , on the higher FY25 base, although we still have over 200bps of GM pressure from tariffs wrapping into 1H. We raise our PT to \\(\\) 135\\(from\\) \\ \\(120\\) , which is based on 25x (previously 24x) our updated FY26 EPS estimate; we think the higher multiple is justified by the stronger top- line and solid execution we've seen so far this year.  \n\n\n## Details  \n\n\n1. Adj. EPS of \\(\\) 0.81\\(was well above our\\) \\ \\(0.57\\) /Bloomberg consensus \\(\\) 0.62\\(as comps of +12.4\\%\\(was better than guidance of +7 - 9\\%\\) (consensus at the high end). GM leveraged 70bps on the higher top - line guidance/consensus expectations of down y/y, while Adj. SG&A leveraged 20bps vs. expectations of 20bps deleverage; below the line was a -\\) \\ \\(0.02\\) net tailwind vs. the Street from higher interest income.  \n\n\n2. The strength in Q2 was broad based across categories, which management attributed to improvements in the assortment, value offering, labor, and marketing. There was also some benefit from product/licensing trends and competitor dislocations.  \n\n\n3. Comp transactions were the primary driver of growth at \\(+8.7\\%\\) vs. Q1 \\(+6.2\\%\\) , with the 2-year steady. This was mainly driven by conversion from better execution.  \n\n\nBarclays Capital Inc. and/or one of its affiliates does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

Comp ticket of \\(+3.4\\%\\) also improved from Q1 \\(+0.9\\%\\) ; the 2-year trend also improved and was similar to the 2-year transactions trend.  \n\n\n5. Sales momentum seems to have continued into Q3 so far with comps guided to \\(+5 - 7\\%\\) from +LSD previously (consensus \\(+2\\%\\) ), which implies 2-year trends in-line to slightly better than Q2. This seems to assume ticket similar to Q2, implying transactions +L-MSD.  \n\n\n6. Q4 comps are still expected to be in line with the original guidance range of flat to \\(+3\\%\\) , which seems conservative. Management discussed one more holiday shopping day this year vs. last year, which should be a \\(\\sim 75\\) bps tailwind based on the company's math.  \n\n\n7. Tariff related price increases are now expected to be a net benefit as elasticity has been better than expected; FIVE had originally assumed -1x elasticity based on tests conducted in April but saw an improvement in unit degradation through Q2 and into Q3.  \n\n\n8. The company believes that the price increases it has made is enough to cover existing tariffs; FIVE could raise prices incrementally if tariffs move higher but would not expect a significant impact on FY25 due to the timing of receipts. We note that guidance seems to embed India tariffs of \\(25\\%\\) instead of the \\(50\\%\\) that went into effect earlier in the day.  \n\n\n9. Management will not decrease the mix of Five Beyond, which may have contributed to the slowdown last year, but the company is moving Five Beyond products to their respective worlds from the back of the store and focusing on lower price points within Five Beyond vs. \\(\\) 15+\\(.  \n\n\n10. FY25 margin guidance is now expected to be -130bps at the midpoint vs. -200bps previously due to the better top-line and lower tariff impact, partially offset by higher incentive comp (more details below).  \n\n\n11. Incentive comp is now expected to be a 70bps y/y headwind to FY25 vs. 50bps previously; the cadence includes -150bps in Q2 (vs. \\(\\sim 100\\) bps previously), \\(\\sim 70\\) bps in Q3, and \\(\\sim 60\\) bps in Q4 (vs. \\(\\sim 40 - 50\\) bps previously for both Q3/Q4).  \n\n\n12. Labor will be less of a headwind in 2H as FIVE starts to cycle last year's investments. The company also discussed labor efficiencies from improved inventory flow and price simplification, although there will be some additional costs in Q3 related to the physical inventory count.  \n\n\n13. Q3 EBIT margin is expected to be -230bps y/y at the midpoint (vs. -400bps prior, consensus -370bps), which incorporates a net tariff impact of -160bps vs. -225bps previously and better fixed cost leverage, partially offset by incentive comp.  \n\n\n14. Shrink could drive potential upside to GM in Q3 (we est. tens of bps); the company did not provide a shrink update on this call as it is still in the middle of inventory checks.  \n\n\n15. Q4 margin guidance was left unchanged, including the net tariff impact of -225bps.  \n\n\n16. FY25 capex is now expected to be at the low end of the prior range of \\(\\) 210-230\\$ m despite leaving the 150 new stores target unchanged as the cost of converting \\(\\sim 30\\) Party City locations was less than expected.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\nFIVE: Quarterly and Annual EPS (USD)\n\n\n\n<table><tr><td></td><td>2024</td><td>+</td><td>2025</td><td></td><td>2026</td><td></td><td>Change y/y</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FY Jan</td><td>Actual</td><td></td><td>New</td><td>Cons</td><td>Old</td><td>New</td><td>Cons</td><td>2025 2026</td></tr><tr><td>Q1</td><td></td><td>0.86A</td><td>0.86A</td><td>0.62E</td><td>0.62E</td><td>0.75E</td><td>43%</td><td>-28%</td></tr><tr><td>Q2</td><td></td><td>0.81A</td><td>0.62E</td><td>0.47E</td><td>0.62E</td><td>0.61E</td><td>50%</td><td>-23%</td></tr><tr><td>Q3</td><td>0.42A</td><td>0.19E</td><td>0.02E</td><td>0.12E</td><td>0.36E</td><td>0.20E</td><td>-55%</td><td>89%</td></tr><tr><td>Q4</td><td>3.48A</td><td>3.28E</td><td>3.23E</td><td>3.79E</td><td>3.73E</td><td>3.80E</td><td>-8%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5.04A</td><td>4.72E</td><td>5.07E</td><td>4.72E</td><td>5.00E</td><td>5.33E</td><td>5.23E</td><td>0.60% 5%</td></tr><tr><td>P/E</td><td>28.6</td><td></td><td>28.5</td><td></td><td>27.1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>\n\n\nConsensus numbers are from Bloomberg received on 27-Aug-2025; 12:50 GMT\n\n\nSource: Barclays Research<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\nU.S.Broadlines,Hardlines & Food Retail   \n\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">NEUTRAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Five Below Inc (FIVE)</td></tr><tr><td>Income statement (US$mn)</td><td>2024A</td><td>2025E</td><td>2026E</td><td>2027E</td><td>CAGR</td><td>EQUAL WEIGHT</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>3,877</td><td>4,500</td><td>4,940</td><td>5,434</td><td>11.9%</td><td>Price Target</td></tr><tr><td>EBITDA (adj)</td><td>491</td><td>540</td><td>564</td><td>643</td><td>9.4%</td><td>Why EQUAL WEIGHT?</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT (adj)</td><td>356</td><td>361</td><td>378</td><td>434</td><td>6.8%</td><td>We view FIVE as one of the most differentiated concepts in retail with a potential roadmap to above-average unit and comps growth.</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax income (adj)</td><td>339</td><td>364</td><td>365</td><td>424</td><td>7.8%</td><td>However, there&#x27;s uncertainty around the management change and business strategy, along with what seems to be some company specific issues.

The return of trends and licensing can also provide a boost<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\nto sales. To the downside: 1) Consumer spending risk, with the low/middle income consumer increasingly under pressure and over \\(70\\%\\) of sales in discretionary categories. 2) Concentration of comps, with most of FIVE's growth now coming from consumables, although that is also helping offset the moderation in discretionary categories that outperformed significantly in 2021. 3) Risk of increased tariffs and shrink, which could limit the gross margin recovery.  \n\n\n## Disclaimer:  \n\n\nThis publication has been produced by Barclays Research Department in the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC and/or one or more of its affiliates (collectively and each individually, \"Barclays\").  \n\n\nIt has been prepared for institutional investors and not for retail investors.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.  \n\n\nAny information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (\"Information\"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (\"ESG Regimes\"), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.  \n\n\nIRS Circular 230 Prepared Materials Disclaimer: Barclays does not provide tax advice and nothing contained herein should be construed to be tax advice.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist.
