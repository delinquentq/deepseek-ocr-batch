Overall, we continue to witness optimism among investors especially around AI sentiment, while interest level towards non- AI segments remain low. Key discussion with investors mainly focused on 1) TSMC's earnings growth outlook, capex trajectory towards 2027 and the implications to SPE, 2) debates on demand over ASICs vs AI GPU, 3) the dollar content growth outlook and the overview of competitive landscape shift within testing industry, and 4) advanced packaging demand trend, especially on CoWoS capacity outlook and the implications to CoWoS equipment vendors. Our key stock highlights including TSMC (Buy, on CL), MediaTek (Buy on CL), ASE (Buy), MPI (Buy), WinWay (Buy), GPTC (Buy), and All Ring (Buy). Below, we summarize the key takeaways from our meetings.",

We also note that TSMC's share price (+12%) has largely unperformed other global key AI names YTD such as SK Hynix (+52%), Nvidia (+31%), Broadcom (+28%), AMD (+38%), etc. However, some pushback from investors was centered on a potential decelerating growth into 2026E. Nevertheless, we argue that we believe TSMC would continue to observe a re- rating with its ongoing strategy towards overseas capacity diversification. We feel that overall sentiment also further improved especially after the announcement of US semi tariff, from which TSMC is likely to be exempt (see also note). Furthermore, we continue to expect another strong growth year for TSMC into 2026E with revenue (in USD term) to grow by another 20% despite a robust 34% growth in 2025E, driven by the ramp up of 2nm/3nm nodes as well as the higher pricing for advanced nodes/packaging.",

We feel that long- short funds were in generally holding a more negative view towards the name given the lack of near term catalysts, lukewarm smartphone market demand outlook and the continuous tape- out schedule delay of the TPU project. However, on the flip side, we sense that the AI ASIC TAM expansion theme remains compelling for long only investors, even as the first AI ASIC project tape- out timeline is now experiencing some setbacks. Nevertheless, the tape out timing of MediaTek's TPU project remains to be the key monitor point among most investors. Overall, we remain optimistic about MediaTek's ongoing TAM expansion into the US \\(45bn ASIC market. As TPU becomes MediaTek's first stepping stone into this new TAM, we see a high likelihood of more CSP project wins going forward.",

      "text": "During our marketing trip, we consistently emphasized the increasing significance of the chiplet trend as the semiconductor industry transitions to more advanced process nodes. This evolution is a primary catalyst for the escalating demand for advanced packaging solutions. As detailed in our note: Taiwan Technology: Growing chiplet adoption to unlock a new era of advanced packaging; Buy TSMC (on CL)/ASE/All Ring/GPTC (15 August 2025), we underscored the substantial advantages of adopting chiplet designs. The inherent cost efficiencies and benefits of hybrid integration, facilitated by advanced packaging technologies such as CoWoS, are fostering wider adoption across diverse applications. This proliferation is notably expanding from AI into a broader spectrum of non- AI segments including server CPUs, networking chips, and other high- end consumer chips, etc. We believe this continuous penetration will drive a more sustained CoWoS/advanced packaging capacity expansion into 2027 and beyond. We are forecasting CoWoS shipment to reach 664k/1,080k/1,566k wafers and capacity of 675k/1,200k/1,740k wafers in 2025- 2027E.",
