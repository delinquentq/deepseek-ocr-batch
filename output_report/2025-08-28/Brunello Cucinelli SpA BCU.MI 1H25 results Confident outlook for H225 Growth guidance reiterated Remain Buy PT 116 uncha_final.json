The key takeaway is that the company has reiterated its prior outlook commentary for FY25 which looks for c. +10% growth, and following the positive trend in 2026 S/S orders, management also reiterated its commentary for c. +10% growth in FY26.",

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price.
