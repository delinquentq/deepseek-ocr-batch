Management kept guidance largely unchanged, expecting a re- acceleration in 2H. We make small changes to our estimates and remain EW (new PT €34.0 PT vs €33.5 PT). A potential upside risk is German consolidation.  \n\n\nChanges in our estimates (EW - new €34.0 PT, was €33.5). Post 2Q25 results, we update our estimates. We decrease our FY25E/FY26E revenues by \\(- 0.5\\% / - 0.3\\%\\) and Adj. EBITDA by \\(- 0.7\\% / - 0.7\\%\\) , respectively, reflecting higher mobile ARPU erosion and lower Waipu TV net adds. This leaves us at the low end of the company's Adj. EBITDA guidance for 2025E (€520m- 540m). We decrease our FY25 FCF estimate by \\(- 3.5\\%\\) , at the low end of guidance (€300m- 320m). We increase our FY26 estimate by \\(+3.1\\%\\) . As a result, we raise our DCF- based price target from €33.5 to €34.0/share, leaving upside potential of c. \\(+20\\%\\) . On our estimates, Freenet trades at 8.6x FY25E EV/EBITDA, 9.4x EV/OpFCF and offers an \\(8.3\\%\\) ECFF yield. This compares to its peer group at 7.8x, 11.2x, and 8.3%. We remain EW (new PT €34.0 PT vs €33.5 PT). A potential upside risk is German consolidation as discussed in Consolidation 2.0 - Sizing the RanCo opportunity - 26 June 2025.  \n\n\n\nFNTGn.DE: Financial and Valuation Metrics EPS (EUR)   \n\n<table><tr><td>FY Dec</td><td>2023</td><td>2024</td><td>2025</td><td>2026</td><td>2027</td></tr><tr><td>EPS</td><td>2.01A</td><td>2.06A</td><td>2.18E</td><td>2.28E</td><td>2.41E</td></tr><tr><td>Previous EPS</td><td>2.01A</td><td>2.06A</td><td>2.17E</td><td>2.26E</td><td>2.40E</td></tr><tr><td>Consensus EPS</td><td>1.30A</td><td>2.08A</td><td>2.46E</td><td>2.53E</td><td>2.68E</td></tr><tr><td>P/E</td><td>14.1</td><td>13.7</td><td>13.0</td><td>12.4</td><td>11.8</td></tr></table>\n\n\nConsensus numbers are from Bloomberg received on 27-Aug-2025; 12:50 GMT Source: Barclays Research  \n\n![Figure 0-0](images/0_0.jpg)\n  \n\n\nBarclays Capital Inc. and/or one of its affiliates does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.  \n\n\n## Stock Rating  \n\n\nOverweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12- month investment horizon.  \n\n\nEqual Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12- month investment horizon.  \n\n\nUnderweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12- month investment horizon.  \n\n\nRating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.  \n\n\n## Industry View  \n\n\nPositive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.  \n\n\nNeutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.  \n\n\nNegative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.  \n\n\nBelow is the list of companies that constitute the \"industry coverage universe\":  \n\n\n## European Telecom Services  \n\n\n1&1 AG (1U1.DE)  \n\n\nBT Group PLC (BT.L)  \n\n\nDigi Communications N.V.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.  \n\n\nAny information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (\"Information\"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (\"ESG Regimes\"), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.  \n\n\nIRS Circular 230 Prepared Materials Disclaimer: Barclays does not provide tax advice and nothing contained herein should be construed to be tax advice.

The United Kingdom has laws which differ from Australian laws. To the extent that this communication involves the provision of financial services by BBPLC to Australian Wholesale Clients, BBPLC relies on the relevant exemption from the requirement to hold an AFSL. Accordingly, BBPLC does not hold an AFSL.  \n\n\nThis communication may be distributed to you by either: (i) Barclays Bank PLC directly, (ii) Barrenjoye Markets Pty Limited (ACN 636 976 059, \"Barrenjoye\"), the holder of Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) 521800, a non- affiliated third party distributor, where clearly identified to you by Barrenjoye.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
