Our analysis suggests both are probable. In this cross-asset and cross-sector note, we explore the prospects for the Siemens AG (SIE) and Siemens Healthineers AG (SHL) equities under different simplification scenarios ahead of an important December 9 CMD, in addition to assessing the impact this would have on credit metrics. We are moving to an OW (from NR) with a Dec-26 PT of €30 (c30% upside), place the stock on Positive Catalyst Watch into the CMD and add it to our Analyst Focus List.",

However, this blue sky scenario would be quite uncharacteristic for Siemens. More probable scenarios would be (A) falling to a sub-50% holding via block placings for buyback purposes, or (B) distributing say 2/3rds of the 73% holding as a dividend-in-kind. In our view, scenario A would fail to placate investors, whereas a variation of scenario B would result in a small-enough minority to improve multiples whilst retaining optionality.",
