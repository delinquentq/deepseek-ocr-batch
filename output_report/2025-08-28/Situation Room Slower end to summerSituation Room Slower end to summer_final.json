The \"bond\" category refers to the broad high grade market, which includes Treasuries, mortgages and agencies in addition to corporate bonds. This category accounts for the majority of AUM and flows. On the other hand the dedicated corporate bond funds and ETFs are much smaller in terms of assets under management. We also include the \"total return\" bond category in our tracking of high grade flows. Finally note that \"short-term\" maturity refers to duration of 0 to 4 years.",

No security, financial instrument or derivative is suitable for all investors. Digital assets are extremely speculative, volatile and are largely unregulated. In some cases, securities and other financial instruments may be difficult to value or sell and reliable information about the value or risks related to the security or financial instrument may be difficult to obtain. Investors should note that income from such securities and other financial instruments, if any, may fluctuate and that price or value of such securities and instruments may rise or fall and, in some cases, investors may lose their entire principal investment. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. Levels and basis for taxation may change.",
