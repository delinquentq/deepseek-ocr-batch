Core OP (GP minus SG&A expense) was up \\(14\\%\\) yoy in 2Q25 with on- track GPM expansion (+0.4pp yoy) and expense savings. Key surprise: 1) Topline came slightly ahead of expectation driven by (i) sequential recovery in liquid milk, which recorded \\(0.8\\%\\) yoy sales decline in 2Q25 and continued to narrow vs. \\(- 1\\%\\) yoy in 1Q25 (with 1H ending at - \\(2.1\\%\\) yoy, better vs. Mengniu's - \\(11\\%\\) decline), (ii) strong rebound in Frozen Dairy at \\(+38\\%\\) yoy from a low base (beat our expectation), and (iii) continued robust momentum in Milk powder and products with sales up \\(10\\%\\) yoy in 2Q25 and \\(14\\%\\) in 1H25 (in line with GSe). 2) Continued selling expense ratio savings though more modest than our expectation: Overall SG&A expense ratio is down 0.2pp yoy to \\(24.3\\%\\) in 2Q, 0.5pp higher than GSe. Administrative expense ratio was up 0.4pp yoy in 2Q25, while selling expense ratio was cut by 0.7pp in 2Q25 mainly on advertising investment savings (amount down \\(5\\%\\) yoy), 0.2pp/0.3pp higher vs. GSe. Overall, OP margin recorded \\(9.3\\%\\) in 2Q25, up 0.7pp yoy. 3) Lower net non- op expenses: Lower effective tax rate at \\(9.1\\%\\) (down 2.6pp yoy and c.4pp below GSe), finance expenses, and impairment losses related to raw milk oversupply and credit impairment further accelerated NP growth. Recurring NPM expanded by 2.4pp yoy to \\(8.3\\%\\) in 2Q25. Cash flows: In 2Q25, the OCF stood at Rmb2.0bn, down - \\(34\\%\\) yoy vs. Rmb3.1bn in 2Q24, while capex remained flat at Rmb0.8bn in 2Q25 vs. 2Q24, leading to the FCF of Rmb1.2bn. - \\(47\\%\\) yoy vs Rmb 2.2bn in 2Q24.",
