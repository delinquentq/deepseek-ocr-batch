ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus. Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. Statements and views concerning ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors are typically based upon public statements made by the affected company or other public news, which the author may not have independently verified.

Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",

Certain high- volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal or exceed the amount invested. The yield and average life of CMOs (collateralized mortgage obligations) referenced in this Product will fluctuate depending on the actual rate at which mortgage holders prepay the mortgages underlying the CMO and changes in current interest rates. Any government agency backing of the CMO applies only to the face value of the CMO and not to any premium paid. Certain investments contained in the Product may have tax implications for private customers whereby levels and basis of taxation may be subject to change. If in doubt, investors should seek advice from a tax adviser. The Product does not purport to identify the nature of the specific market or other risks associated with a particular transaction. Advice in the Product is general and should not be construed as personal advice given it has been prepared without taking account of the objectives, financial situation or needs of any particular investor. Accordingly, investors should, before acting on the advice, consider the appropriateness of the advice, having regard to their objectives, financial situation and needs.
