Following NVDA's earnings announcement, today's price action is proving another opportunity for retail to buy the NVDA dip, with a 12:30 cumulative imbalance at 4 times that of yesterday at the same time (Figure 12). Regarding NVDA options, retail investors are neutral on delta exposures but are short gamma, approaching levels seen prior to the tech sell- off in July last year (Figure 5). Looking beyond NVDA, retail investors have been engaging in AI stories at a slower pace in recent months compared to 1H25 (Figure 7 & Figure 8).",
