Despite fears around weaker 3QTD trends, 3Q sales guidance +1-3% is in-line w/cons (+2%). Mgmt sounded very confident in their product pipeline, marketing strategy and long-term growth opportunity. 3Q EPS guidance \\(0.37-0.45\\) is below cons \\(0.49\\) driven by weaker GM, however, one-time tariff impacts from Canada reciprocal/145% China rates are weighing on 3Q GM (which will not continue in 4Q/F26). BBWI remains a \"show-me\" story, but we view sentiment as overly bearish, and we expect comps to accelerate in Sept/Oct as key innovation (Disney Villains, fragrance launch) roll out. In F26, we expect continued new innovation/revenue streams to drive +LSD topline growth and one-time F25 tariff headwinds to flip to tailwinds (est 15-20bps in F26). With shares trading at 7.5x our F26E EPS, we view risk/reward as very attractive.",

The retaliatory tariffs are no longer in place as of Sept 1, which is why 4Q GM is expected to be down less in 4Q vs 3Q; mgmt said the temp tariff headwind is the 140bps difference between 3Q (-240bp) and 4Q (-100bps) headwind; (4) 3Q GM will be negatively impacted by product flowing through at 145% China rates (also abates in 4Q); (5) Mgmt feels the 4Q tariff impact of -100bps is more the run rate as we look to F26, and further mitigation is possible to offset; (6) Mgmt planning AURs to be up in 3Q, similar to 1H +LSD; (7) Mgmt sounded very confident in their ability to selectively pull-back on promos; (8) Mgmt expects fixes to the digital site design to go into place beginning (continued below)...",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation.
