Potential examples of some of these shorter- term growth drag factors might include: 1/ UV- filters destocking by sunscreen producers which hampered DSFIR and SY1 in H1 25 but is not expected to remain a headwind in H2; 2/ Weaker Taste & Wellbeing volume growth in AsiaPac for Givaudan, which was said to reflect order phasing with stronger growth expected in H2; 3/ Weaker pet food end markets and pet nutrition pricing for Symrise which management have firmly argued is a temporary hangover after several strong years of growth and is unlikely to remain a material drag in 2026; 4/ Fade of FX- based pricing tailwinds for Symrise and Givaudan, which have also contributed to slower growth; 5/ Disruption of business in the Middle East on geopolitics, flagged by Kerry as a factor behind the slowdown and miss in its APM division.",

The de- rating of the space since June would seem to indicate the market has some concerns that the top- line slowdown and disappointment experienced in Q2 could continue, or even worsen over the next quarters. Destocking across the peer group in 2023 painfully highlighted that, for all the structural attractions of the space, Ingredients companies generally do not have visibility beyond a few months. The bear case would be that the top- line slowdowns in Q2 could perhaps be driven by more structural issues that could challenge Consumer Ingredients companies' ability to deliver on medium- term algorithms. This report takes a closer look at the potential arguments that might support this thesis: 1/ Pricing pressure emerging in more pockets across Consumer Ingredients in Q2 (pet nutrition for Symrise, fragrance ingredients for F&F players, beauty care for Croda) which could reflect a structural increase in low- cost competition that could weigh on growth and margins; 2/ Emergence of AI technologies which could provide larger customers with the ability to bring more Ingredients R&D/innovation 'in house' and lean less on Ingredients suppliers for 'solutions' expertise, with Unilever's investment to bring in house some fragrance- creation capabilities the most prominent example to date (see 25 for 2025- What if large HPC customers' insourcing of fragrance capabilities steps up in 2025?, 6 Jan 2025); 3/ Structurally more challenged end market growth conditions, particularly in packaged food on increased GLP- 1 use and concerns (and potential emerging regulatory pressure) on UPF consumption.",

This is especially relevant for categories like snacks, bakery, and indulgent foods, which may see reduced demand as consumers on GLP- 1s shift towards lower- calorie, higher- protein, or functional alternatives.",

While the FDA is technically required to respond within 180 days, the likelihood of full revocation appears low given the widespread use of these ingredients across a very high percentage of packaged foods and drinks.

In our view, in the scenario that GRAS status was revoked, companies would likely submit food additive registrations for the majority of products, most of which are approved as additives in Europe.
