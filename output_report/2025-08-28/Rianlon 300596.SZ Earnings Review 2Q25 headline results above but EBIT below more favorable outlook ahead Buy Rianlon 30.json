      "text": "Rianlon reported its 2Q25 results after market close on Aug 27 and held an analyst call on Aug 28. 2Q25 headline NP of Rmb133mn (+18% yoy) came in +11% above GSe (see our preview note here), on higher-than- expected FX gain. EBIT was 5% below mainly due to weaker-than- expected top- line growth (up only +3% yoy) as the company stopped taking low- margin orders (mainly additive formulation products selling into oil majors). On the call, management painted an incrementally more favorable competitive landscape for polymer stabilizers with competitors (including both local and foreign) starting to print loss (in some cases even at the cash level) vs. Rianlon still generating c.25% GPM for the business. The ramp- up of the company's lubricant additives business (10% of Rianlon's GP in 2024) has also progressed well not only in volume (driven by large customers) but also in margin, leading to management guiding up the GPM target for the segment in the next couple of years (towards 25% vs. 10% in 2024) with scope for further expansion enabled by backward integration. Post results, we fine- tune our 2025E- 26E EPS estimates but raise 2027E EPS estimate by 9% to reflect more optimistic GPM outlook for the lubricant additives. Maintain Buy with a raised 12- m TP of Rmb45.0 (vs. Rmb41.0 previously). Below we summarize the key highlights from the results and analyst call.",
