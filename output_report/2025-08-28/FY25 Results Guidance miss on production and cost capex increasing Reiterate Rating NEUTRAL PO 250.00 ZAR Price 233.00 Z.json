Eva Copper FID is 'imminent'. Model update: We update for FY26 guidance, which has a \\(- 18 / - 12\\%\\) impact on our FY26/27 headline earnings. We reiterate our Neutral rating with a new PO of R250 (from R290), based on 1.35x P/NPV, after updating for FY26 and guidance. While we like HAR's gold price leverage (BofA Global Research is constructive on gold, calling it to hit US \\(4,000 / oz\\) in 2H25), we remain cautious on growth execution risk (Eva Copper, MAC Copper).",

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least \\(10\\%\\) and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).",
