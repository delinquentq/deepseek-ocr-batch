Initial market reaction has been negative (with Meituan OTC down \\(9\\%\\) vs. KWEB - \\(3\\%\\) ) likely due to the 2Q miss and anticipation of wider losses for 3Q (we now estimate 3Q food delivery EBIT loss of Rmb>2 per order vs. GSe prior at breakeven). On the positives, we note 1) Meituan's food delivery/instashopping volume growth have accelerated further, and its food delivery unit economics advantage has widened further vs. other players (vs. before the competition) helped by scale/efficiency/higher quality orders, 2) the 'intensity' of food delivery competition is showing signs of peaking in 3Q for the industry (with focus shifting to instant shopping), given the July level of losses are likely unsustainable for all three platforms for an extended period, and for the merchant ecosystem (esp. unchained restaurants). We note Meituan has seen improved unit economics for Aug (vs. July), alongside JD's expectations of sequentially narrower loss per order for 3Q. Alibaba's comments in the upcoming results on Friday will be key.",

Our valuation for In- store, hotel & travel + Instashopping + net cash alone (without counting food delivery or new initiatives) already adds to HK\\$105 per share (on 2026E). We believe its centralized kitchen initiative \"Raccoon Kitchen\" could also potentially bring upside to long- term unit economics, off- setting a more fragmented landscape.

Valuation at HK\\$14 per share vs. prior HK\\$18): 2Q new initiatives losses came in better- than- expected at - Rmb1.9bn (vs. GSE - Rmb2.6bn/consensus - Rmb2.5bn, albeit wider than the - Rmb1.3bn a year ago) supported by improving efficiency in grocery retail businesses while partially offset by the increased costs related to Keeta's overseas expansion. With a long- term target of achieving Rmb100bn overseas GTV by 2033E, Keeta has become the No.1 player in Hong Kong and top 2 player in Saudi Arabia (both in terms of order volumes), and it has recently launched services in Qatar while still preparing for market entry in Brazil. For the grocery retail business, the company aims to invest more to expand the coverage of Xiaoxiang Supermarket (over 1,000 in 20 cities as of now) and is actively exploring new business models (e.g. Happy Monkey). Factoring in the strategic exit of Meituan Select and increased Keeta losses with upfront investment in Qatar, we now forecast - Rmb2.3bn/- Rmb9.0bn loss for 3Q25E/FY25E (prior: - Rmb1.7bn/- Rmb8.6bn).",
