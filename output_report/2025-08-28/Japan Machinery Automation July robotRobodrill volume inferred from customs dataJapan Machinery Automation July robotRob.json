By region, exports to Asia excluding Japan (AeJ) came to 4,429 units \\((+46\\%\\) yoy/+9% mom), with exports to mainland China coming to 3,895 units \\((+72\\%\\) yoy/+12% mom). Exports to North America totaled 1,968 units \\((+197\\%\\) yoy/+14% mom) and exports to Western Europe came to 1,504 units \\((- 17\\%\\) yoy/+59% mom). The quick return to growth in exports to North America, which had fallen in May, was somewhat of a surprise, but we think this could reflect front- loaded demand ahead of the start of \\(15\\%\\) reciprocal tariffs in August. Trends at trading companies suggest that some front- loaded demand has already emerged. We believe it will be necessary to closely examine the level of true investment appetite from next month after the tariff agreement has gone into force.",

Of these, 350 units were shipped to mainland China (- 34% yoy/+53% mom). We believe that only a few Chinese smartphone makers now use Fanuc's Robordills, and that these products are purchased only by foreign smartphone makers and companies in their supply channels. Exports to India, which have been trending higher over the past six months or so, totaled 114 units (+87% yoy/+1,800% mom), and exports to Vietnam totaled 97 units (+304% yoy/+259% mom). While these figures mark an upturn from the declines seen last month, we remain skeptical about the sustainability of investment in AeCJ (particularly smartphones in India and PCs/tablets in Vietnam) by US smartphone majors as production bases. We are seeing signs of a switch to local machine tool makers in China, and we expect this trend to continue.",

Historically, Brother was well- known as a supplier of vertical machining centers for metal casing processing, second only to Fanuc. However, its shipment volume declined sharply after its core customer, Catcher Technologies, withdrew from smartphone- related business. Exports to Asia totaled 270 units in May (+32% yoy), 237 units in June (+87% yoy), and 339 units in July (+12% yoy), marking a continuation of strong yoy momentum.
