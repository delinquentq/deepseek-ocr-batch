With more favourable below- the- line items offsetting our trimmed OSG forecasts, our adj. EPS estimates are unchanged for FY25 and slightly increased for FY26/27.

That said, with growth decelerating in 2H (as a result of exiting Russia operations), many investors also see a lack of Q3- term catalysts for the stock. We argue that delivering MBD organic growth (HSD excl. Russia exit) at 3Q will stand out notably vs. ingredients peers where we expect LSD at best and could lead to a divergence in performance.
