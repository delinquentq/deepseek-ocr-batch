      "text": "Just when it seemed like rail M&A would take a few days off to wrap up the summer, the Trump administration made headlines by firing Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). We think Primus' dismissal was not exactly on the market's M&A bingo card but perhaps it should have been, considering the recent removal of many Democrat appointees from independent agencies like the STB. Primus has voted against rail M&A several times, including the exemption of KCS from the \"new rules\", so the news of his removal should be viewed as a positive for the UP/NS merger although only NSC managed to meaningfully outperform the XLI and the rest of the sector today. The lackluster reaction of UNP relative to some expectations could be attributed to a number of factors, including: Primus potentially being reinstated which could complicate the nomination of a 5th Board member, the potential need to add 3- 4 more members before the decision in mid- 2027 if Primus does not return, the fact that the rest of the industry came out against rail M&A earlier this week, and the possibility that removing Primus was more about establishing Republican control at another independent agency and less about supporting rail M&A. In addition, we could see some inefficiencies during the UP/NS merger review if the STB stays at three members since the Sunshine Act effectively prohibits Board members from discussing the merger or any other case unless it is in a public setting. Overall, we aren't too surprised by the stock reactions to the news as incremental interest remains very low on UP/NS but that should change with the preliminary proxy and after the Labor Day break. See below for our latest thoughts on rail M&A after speaking with a wide range of industry contacts following the dismissal of Primus.",

The STB member who has been consistently opposed to rail M&A even under the \"old rules\" stated that he will fight the decision that he believes is \"legally invalid\". The President can dismiss members of the STB for reasons of \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or maleficence in office\" based on our review of Title 49, Section 1301 of the U.S. Code and according to Primus there was no cause given. Whether or not the President can dismiss members of agencies without cause is a highly contested topic where the administration has booked more wins than losses, including the May 22 Supreme Court decision in Trump v. Wilcox that upheld the dismissals at the NLRB and MSPB. This case and others like it are likely to be fully considered by the Supreme Court next year but the key issue in our view is whether or not the STB yields \"considerable executive power\" on behalf of the President and is subject to these removals, or if it is considered more adjudicative or legislative in nature.",

We expect the remaining Board members would move forward and decide on the UP/NS merger if no new members are added, the Board has operated with only one member for over a year and they still carried the authority to issue decisions. One overlooked potential complication is the Government in Sunshine Act which prohibits a quorum of members (two in this case) from discussing anything of substance other than at a public meeting. The STB has dealt with this in the past as the staff can still hold discussions, but clearly the UP/NS merger review would be unprecedented and this limitation could slow down the review process if no new members are successfully confirmed.",

A White House spokesperson stated the administration would nominate \"new, more qualified members to the Surface Transportation Board in short order\" when addressing the firing of Primus, who was originally appointed by President Trump in 2020. Moving a Democratic and a Republican through the Senate confirmation process could be easier than moving one Republican although these nominees can also be paired up with other agencies. There could be two more seats to fill with the terms of Hedlund (Democrat) and Shultz (Republican) expiring in late Dec 2025 and early Jan 2026 which would mean potentially confirming three or four new Board members before the merger decision in 2027.",

As noted above, we believe the removal of Primus will tilt the perception that rail M&A is easier to push through the STB review process which should boost the implied probability of a UP/NS deal closing after it dropped 5% by our estimate in the last week. We received a few questions on why this was not more positive for the proposed merger and we expect this debate will pick up momentum after Labor Day. In our view, removing Primus sends a positive sign for the merger review process considering the Commerce Secretary said it would be left in the hands of the regulators which are now at a 2-1 Republican majority. However, there is a risk that Primus could successfully challenge this firing on appeal (like Democratic FTC Commissioner Slaughter), bringing the balance back to a 2-2 split while potentially creating more opposition from Senate Democrats to confirm the 5th Board member.",

Ultimately, we believe the primary reason there wasn't a bigger reaction to the news is the realization that there are still complexities at the STB as noted above, including the lingering doubt that removing Primus doesn't actually send a strong signal on M&A, which the rest of the industry effectively came out against earlier this week (details here). In addition, there is a general sense of fatigue for transport stocks as the recovery is still just around the corner, while new tariffs and the risk of falling imports give the incremental investor in UNP more reasons to delay ramping up on the story. The most interesting information coming out of the preliminary proxy will be the background of UP's discussions with CSX as well as more details on revenue synergies. The administration recently spoke of potential future investments in chemical industries like shipbuilding (click here), and with rails having similar characteristics and significance to the U.S. economy, we wouldn't be entirely surprised to see if rails are considered for similar investment support in the future.",

Our conversations with a wide range of industry contacts throughout the day were a mix of disappointment that the recent streak of firings extended to the STB and concern that it could affect the legitimacy of the organization and the quality of its decisions. There were also questions raised as to whether or not the STB could have only two members when the UP/NS merger decision came due in May/June 2027 if Shultz was re-nominated, Hedlund left, and no other members were confirmed. The only public criticism of firing Primus came from the SMART TD which is not too surprising but indicative of the how vocal the rail unions",
