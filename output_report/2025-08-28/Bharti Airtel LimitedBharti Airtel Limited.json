BHARTI continues to scope for ARPU to rise from continued repair to Rs350- 400 over time. Recent entry- level plan changes are steps in the right direction but won't have a material impact on ARPU on their own. Mgmt views Homes as a significant multi- year opportunity as a combination of fiber and FWA where Airtel's business can more than double should \\(100m\\) households take this. The co's incremental focus areas for capital deployment are deleveraging, dividend increases, capex towards cloud and data centres and balance sheet leverage in digital lending.

However, it is unlikely to drive meaningful change in ARPU on its own. BHARTI sees adequate opportunity to keep taking pricing up towards Rs350-400 with further tariff actions given the stratified consumer base. Organic ARPU drivers remain smartphone upgraders, postpaid upgrades, roaming and data consumption.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
