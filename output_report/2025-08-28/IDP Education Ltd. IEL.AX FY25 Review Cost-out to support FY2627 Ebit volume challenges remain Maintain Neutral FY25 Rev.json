While the cost- outs are positive in a challenging market, variability and uncertainty in volumes remain with key source regions remaining at risk of further declines and supply limits present in destination countries. Key catalysts include: impact from changes to various Australian policies across student intake, visa prices and English Language testing (late- 2025/2026), Canadian Budget (Sep- Dec 2025), implementation of UK White Paper (late- 2025/early- 2026), SELTS outcome in UK (late- 2025/2026), and USA policy developments (varied).

While we expect IEL to emerge from the current industry challenges longer term well- positioned and with greater market share, once immigration policy and student placements demand stabilize, we consider the near- term outlook to remain uncertain with key policy outcomes expected across core regions, limited visibility on immigration stability and risks surrounding demand from in- take regions.
