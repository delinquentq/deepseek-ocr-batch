Schaeffler CEO of Powertrain and Chassis Matthias Zink (president of EU supplier body CLEPA) co- signed a 3 page letter (LINK) noted that \"Meeting the rigid car and van CO2 targets for 2030 and 2035 is, in today's world, simply no longer feasible. Instead, the current CO2 reduction path in road transport must be recalibrated to ensure it delivers on EU climate goals whilst also safeguarding Europe's industrial competitiveness, social cohesion, and the strategic resilience of its supply chains\" adding that the groups hope to \"recalibrate EU policy for the automotive value chain in line with today's shifting market, geopolitical, and economic realities.\" Whilst Schaeffler have hedged their ICE exposure with their e- mobility business, we see any dilution to the EU CO2 framework as a positive for Schaeffler given the exposure to legacy ICE technologies and the higher margin profile of those activities today. We look for any signs of EU pragmatism on this issue as a potential positive catalyst for the industry, with Schaeffler clearly positive exposed.",

We think there could be some giveback in the 2H from an investment perspective across the industry, with some investment reductions unsustainable and likely to dribble back in to 2H25 i.e. delayed not structurally cut. The overall narrative across the sector is that investment spend is coming down from here, but we think Schaeffler arguably has more room to catch up now. A big part of this could be driven by lower investment spend in e- mobility and PTC, where we think the group can be more aggressive from here on the R&D side.

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation.
