In response to a question on whether there are specific levels of Seoul housing price inflation that would allow for BOK easing, the Governor reiterated previous comments that the MPC does not aim to control housing prices through policy rate changes. That said, the MPC closely monitors housing prices given their close correlation with household debt growth. Also, given a need for coordination with broader government policies, the MPC aims to adjust the timing of the next policy rate cut so that it does not offset the impact of the government's recent housing market stabilization measures. Furthermore, the MPC will continue to take a holistic assessment including a review of current housing inflation relative to historic average, risks of acceleration and whether the housing inflation is broadening from Seoul to other regions.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
