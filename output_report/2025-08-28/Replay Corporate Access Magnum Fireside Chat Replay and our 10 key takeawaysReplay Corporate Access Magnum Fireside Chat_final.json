A cadre of very experienced general managers have been installed in all the key country roles with many having more than a decade of experience. The reason CEO Peter ter Kolve highlighted for these people upgrades is that, it is very different running a relatively smaller division in a large company like Unilever vs a listed standalone pure play ice cream company. This big change of its operating model required a major talent intervention. There was also the need to have more senior people with public markets experience, which it now has with its CFO and head of HR. Although many are recent hires, quite a few have been through a few (ice cream) seasons, so they already have good experience about how best to squeeze growth, margins and cash.",

We think this kind of jump is meaningful and a good sign. Also in a related question as part of the same survey, \\(60\\%\\) of all Magnum employees in June 25 expect the business performance of Magnum to improve over the next six months. Clearly some investors might take these stats with a grain of salt, but at face value, usually when the employees believe in the vision it is more likely to become a reality. Peter ter Kolve summed up the mindset and culture which he is trying to instill, which is that of an 68bn revenue start up.",

This heritage matters as it has been the category creator in Ice Cream for a long time. Froneri has performed better than Unilever in recent years for sure, but portfolio for portfolio, we think Magnum's is materially better. It owns four of the five biggest brands in the category (Heart/Walls (revs €2.8bn), Magnum (revs €2bn), Ben&Jerry's (€1.1bn) and Cornetto (€0.8bn). Magnum also has double the freezer real estate (3m Freezers) of its nearest competitor and has a global market share which is \\(21\\%\\) vs Froneri's \\(9\\%\\) . Magnum's market share broken down by region is highest in Europe at \\(31\\%\\) , followed by the US at \\(19\\%\\) and \\(11\\%\\) in ROW.

The negative view is that it is simply evidence of the difficult and complex nature of ice cream, or alternatively the positive view is that the separation will allow Magnum to do exactly what Froneri has done for the last six years. Magnum's independence (from Unilever) means it will be able to curate a distinctive operating model and strategy outside of Unilever. We are minded to take the more positive view. Salespeople who have previously been selling multiple categories to retailers like Carrefour or Walmart will now be \\(100\\%\\) focused on ice cream, and we can't see how this will not be a big unlock in terms of day to day execution. We certainly understand that in the short term it will mean that capex will need to go up and returns come down to unlock the full value opportunity.",

The biggest challenge however is predicting weather patterns 2- 3 weeks in advance to make sure they have the right SKUs in the right places. Google weather forecasting data is making sizeable strides in accuracy and, as Magnum gets closer to calling the right weather patterns even down to individual zip codes, this could be a game changer in terms of optimizing its resource allocation.",

Magnum has 3 million installed freezers around the world which is double its nearest competitor but admitted this number has been surprisingly declining on average by around \\(2\\%\\) per year. The reason for this is that Unilever was very focused on profit per freezer but Peter ter Kulve made the point that you can't cut your freezer numbers to victory. Given ice cream is all about availability, Magnum aspires to develop a Coca Cola mindset of having its ice cream brands always 'within thumbs reach of desire'.",

Therefore the practice of reducing freezer numbers has already been reversed. What we would like to know at the CMD is what the cadence of freezer growth will look like in the next few years. Clearly as more of its freezers will use smart AI and monitoring tools, it should also be able to improve the payback on its less well performing freezer estate.",

This is an important point as it is typically supermarkets and aggressive pricing strategies that usually push down margins. Growth of quick commerce in countries such as India is rapid and is dis- intermediating supermarkets, and in the growing e- commerce channel margins can be attractive, meaning that Magnum's high ROW margins can be sustained even as channels shift rapidly.",

The calorie count in water based ice lollies can be much lower at 50 calories or less. In terms of innovation, Peter ter Kulse said there has been a lot of work done on indulgence and health trends in ice cream but less innovation around refreshment and the ability for ice creams to do a better job in the hydration space, which could be a significant focus area for the company going forward.

The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
