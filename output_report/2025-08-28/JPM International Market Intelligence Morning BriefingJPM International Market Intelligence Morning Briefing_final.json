The stock market reaction across Asia Tech seems to suggest the AI trade remains intact, although reports that China chipmakers are aiming to triple AI chip output next year also helped (within SHCOMP, Tech is the only sector in the green this morning as 85% of stocks are lower). That said, NVDA results + a soft/in- line PCE on Friday, could be conducive of another leg to the broadening the trade (here from Drew) given positioning backdrop (Chart below) and SPX 493 earnings acceleration in 2Q25. The move lower in front- end rates also helps. 2Y1M USD OIS broke below 3% yesterday but likely reflecting the administration effort to reshape the Fed as Inflation expectations creep higher (2yr inflation swaps are now at highest level since late 2022). Continue to watch Gold for possible breakout after a long period of consolidation.",
