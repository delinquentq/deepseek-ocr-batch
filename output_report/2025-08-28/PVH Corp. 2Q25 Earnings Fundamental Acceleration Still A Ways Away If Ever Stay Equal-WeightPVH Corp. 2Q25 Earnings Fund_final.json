Moving to profitability, 3Q EPS guidance also appears beat- able given the q/q EBIT/OM cadence screens particularly conservative relative to history, even when considering incremental tariff & marketing investment (i.e., EBIT dollars - 17% vs. historically +10%, & OM \\~flat q/q vs. historically +100 bps q/q).

Mgmt. attributed this lack of 2Q profitability/EPS upside flow- thru to its 2H/FY outlook to 1) worse tariff rates vs. 3M ago, & 2) intentionaly higher marketing spend in 3Q. Following this 2Q outperformance, we now view FY guidance as more achievable than prior (more here), particularly on profitability. More specifically, while prior FY profitability guidance embedded an outsized 2H improvement vs. 1H trend (+2 pts H/H vs. +1 pt historical avg.), 2Q outperformance points to a more normalized 2H outlook vs. history (+1 pt H/H vs. +1 pt historically) - making for a more achievable bar, in our view. That said, we continue to caution updated FY profitability guidance requires substantial 4Q SG&A reduction (-MSD % y/y vs. +1% 1Q- 3Q), which mgmt. attributed to global cost efficiency gains within IT, distribution, & Europe operations but to us may be optimistic considering recent trend. Altogether, we model both FY sales growth & profitability/EPS near the midpoint of revised guidance (+1.6% & \\$10.80 vs. up slightly to +LSD & \\$10.75- 11.00, respectively), reflective of higher FY sales growth (+1.6% vs. +0.6% prior) & OM/EPS (8.4%/\\$10.80 vs. 8.1%/\\$10.53 prior)",
