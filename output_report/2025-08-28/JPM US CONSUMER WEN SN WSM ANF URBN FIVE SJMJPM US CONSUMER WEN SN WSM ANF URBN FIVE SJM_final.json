Our take: while Patraic leaving unexpectedly after a short tenure (joined late April 2024) reads negative to us given the strong momentum, our understanding is that he is departing for another opportunity outside of small appliance industry, and we think the transition will be smooth. Mr. Reagan was the company's first permanent CFO since listing in the U.S. (had relied on interim CFO from listing in mid- 2023) and, as such, we think the company opted for a higher- profile external hire for the role perhaps at the expense of the right cultural fit for SN's faced paced/disruptive organization.",

While the market may have expected \\(\\sim 5\\%\\) comps, WSM raised sales guidance for the year, but kept the operating margin given its effective tariff rate doubled (14% to 28%) since reporting 1Q (though we view the margin guide conservatively, a point that seemed \"transparent\" on the call). That said, SSS accelerated only 30 bps to 3.7%, while CPI data indicated a 270- bp acceleration in pricing indicating WSM either: (1) held back on material pricing (unlikely given prior commentary, in our view); (2) had 1Q demand pull- forward ahead of tariffs (mgmt said no); or (3) experienced some trade- down (or lack of trade- up) as we've heard from other retailers that this trend accelerated in 1H25 (Overweight- rated W, a mass player, saw comps accelerate \\(>300\\) bps QOQ). Some QTD acceleration appears likely, however, given the midpoint of the updated guide",

The other 2H drivers in coffee would be incremental pricing (to combat the higher tariffs, which start to flow through in 3Q26) and lower elasticity on the first round of pricing. Outside of Coffee, Pet sales growth should benefit from lapping a work stoppage in 3Q and retailer inventory cuts in 4Q. Sweet Baked Snacks profit is expected to get sequentially better throughout FY26 as SJM's cost savings actions take hold, with the biggest step up coming in 4Q, when cost savings take hold. Finally, it is possible that SJM's overall earnings outlook is shaping up slightly worse than previously anticipated. The guidance range ( \\(8.50 - 9.50\\) ) remains unusually wide, and the stepped- up Brazil tariffs are both incremental to SJM's prior outlook and likely to flow through SJM's COGS a month or two before offsetting pricing actions take hold. A quarter ago, we think investors interpreted the upper half of SJM's range as being more likely, with the bottom \\(0.50\\) providing a cushion in case more challenges arose.

But we also think investors might be more reticent to count on earnings upside coming from coffee after (a) 1Q missed despite low elasticity and (b) the assumed elasticity is now lower than the prior outlook.
