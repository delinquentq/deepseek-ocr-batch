Management expects this to improve ROE and to be EPS- accretive over time. However, assuming a buyback of the capital released (JEFE c.\\\\$350m), we see this bar as low, given i) management noted the ROE of the equipment finance business is below the broader group ROE, and ii) the stock, tades at a discount to book value. To this end, our high- level analysis suggests the deal would be 1% EPS accretive if BOQ only earned 21bp of servicing revenue, consistent with the 20- 30bp PPM AU (not covered) earns on equivalent transactions. Furthermore, this is bigger any gain on sale, which, over time, has averaged c.1% of loans sold for PPM. ii) Entered into a strategic partnership with Capgemini for agentic AI business processing services, anticipates realising annualised cost savings of at least A\\$30mn from FY27.",
