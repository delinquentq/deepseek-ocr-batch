We are positive on Vanchip's migration to higher- end 5G PA modules (e.g. LPAMiD, LPAMiF) and product line expansions from cellular PA to WiFi PA, automotive PA and receiver products. However, we are cautious on the near- term trend given the modest growth of smartphone and markets, lack of major wireless technology upgrade cycle in near- term (6G still takes time) and continuous competition among RFFE players.
