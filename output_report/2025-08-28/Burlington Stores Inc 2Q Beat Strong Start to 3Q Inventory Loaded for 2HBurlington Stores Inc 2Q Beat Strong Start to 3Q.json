BURL's 2Q SSS accelerated the most vs Offprice peers on a 1-yr and 2-yr rate, with SSS accelerating +5pp on a 1-yr to +5% (Marmaxx accelerated +1pp, ROST +2pp). Separately, we think BURL accelerated the most intra-quarter with May at +1% and the quarter totaling to +5% (suggesting a very high exit rate in July). The +100bp GM beat was also impressive driven by Merch Margin +60bp (2-yr Merch Margin accelerated sequentially by +40bp despite the onset of tariffs) and SG&A leverage was better than expected, resulting in 6.0% EBIT margin for the quarter (Street 4.6%; EVRe 4.8%). Clean EPS of \\(1.72 vs. our\\) 1.33 was a huge beat.",

Looking ahead to 3Q, in normal BURL practice, guidance is for SSS flat to +2% (conservatively assuming a deceleration from +5% in 2Q). Key on the call will be detail on the quarter-to-date call which is off to a solid start (before comparisons decelerate). As a reminder, BURL started 3Q24 with SSS up +6% in the first six weeks of the quarter before unfavorable weather (-3pp from warm weather, -1pp from hurricanes) dragged the remainder of the quarter down to -1%. Simply put, 2-year stack math suggests 3Q comps should beat guide materially with very easy compares ahead.",

Offprice multiples should expand in the near-term in anticipation of easing compares in Sept/Oct (especially with early cold weather this week). We're bullish.
