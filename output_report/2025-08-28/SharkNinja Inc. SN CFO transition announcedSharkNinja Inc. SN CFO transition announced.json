That said, we remain constructive on the stock and believe that Mr. Quigley's significant tenure at SN will support strong operational and financial continuity as the company executes its core growth initiatives. Mr. Quigley's experience spans both internal- facing and investor- facing roles. While we acknowledge turnover in the CFO role in recent years, we remain encouraged by leadership continuity in the most critical areas of SN's operations (CEO, CCO, CDO, CPO), enabling the company to deliver on innovation- led growth. We look forward to hosting SN's CEO and interim CFO at our Global Retail Conference next week.",
