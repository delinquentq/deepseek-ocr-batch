Pre- clinical trials, although positive, give no firm indication of a product's true viability, and full foresight on future market conditions is difficult to obtain. In its favour, MSB's base product is found naturally in the body, and we see little reason to believe that injections of concentrated numbers would cause serious health issues or be relatively less effective in doing their natural job. Cancer concerns arising from the use of embryonic stem cells have not been mirrored in the use of adult stem cells. Problems associated with overgrowth of bones or tissue in sensitive areas are more likely, but less of a concern. If this becomes an issue, we believe that potentially it could be controlled by appropriate dosage and thus would affect the product's viability only marginally. To date, all preclinical and clinical trials have shown indications for the product's viability.",
