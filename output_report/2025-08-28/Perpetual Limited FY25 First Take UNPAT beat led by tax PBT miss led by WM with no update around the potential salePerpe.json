However, UPBT of A\\\\$279.2mn was a miss on JPMF of A\\\\$282.5mn. This was driven by inline revenues and a miss on operating expenses offset by tax and lower group costs. Divisionally, Asset Management was a small miss, Corporate Trust and Group were a small beat while Wealth Management was a notable miss on JPMF led by lower revenue margins vs expectations. Within expenses, OPEX came in much higher but was partially offset by lower D&A and share- based expenses.",
