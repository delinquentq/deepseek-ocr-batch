Overall we expect the results to be relatively well received given a book to bill of 1.05 in the quarter, and the EBIT beat, as well as improved YoY cash performance, helped by lower working capital outflows. The 20 bps gross margin decline is disappointing but did face both FX and tariff impacts in the quarter. The comments from management on China to recover in F2H are encouraging for the market leader in that region. We expect the shares to be up on the back of these results.",
