      "text": "We highlight key takeaways from Pernod Ricard's (not covered) FY25 earnings release, through June 30th, given reads for both Brown- Forman and Diageo. Similar to Diageo, Pernod shared that U.S. results were impacted by subdued consumer confidence and prolonged tariff uncertainty while China results were impacted by continued weak consumer sentiment - see slides in the appendix. Importantly, Pernod noted that the U.S. market is not favorable to pricing and does not anticipate price increases in response to tariffs, a possible benefit for Brown- Forman. FY25 organic net sales declined \\(- 3\\%\\) \\((+1\\%\\) excluding the U.S. and China), while volumes recovered to \\(+2\\%\\) . The firm reiterated its guidance for FY26 to be a \"transition year,\" with improving organic net sales trends skewed to F2H26. F1Q26 expected to be in decline due to numerous headwinds, including distributor inventory adjustments in the U.S., soft consumer demand and inventory adjustments in China, excise policy changes in India, and Cognac sales in Duty Free China only resuming in F2Q. The firm further reiterated its medium- term outlook of \\(+3 - 6\\%\\) for FY27- 29, implemented at half- year results in February and lowered from \\(+4 - 7\\%\\) previously.
