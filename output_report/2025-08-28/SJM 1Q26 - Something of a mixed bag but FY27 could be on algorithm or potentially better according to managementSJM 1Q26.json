At the same time, there is ongoing weakness in sales within the Hostess business, which is likely to persist as the company eliminates 25% of SKUs over the coming quarter. But, the bottom line will be supported by the closure of the Indianapolis plant and improved margins as less profitable SKUs are eliminated. Pet treating behavior also remains weak for now. While leverage remains fairly high at 4.3x, the company is focusing on &#36;500m in debt reduction in each of the next two fiscal years with a view to returning to 3.0x by the end of FY27.",

It's also possible that tariff exemptions could be granted at some point down the road since coffee cannot be grown in the mainland of the US.
