It saw Meituan, which holds a c.60- 70% market share in China, report revenues +6% QoQ, but with adj. EBITDA - 77% QoQ, equating to a 76% miss to consensus, while also guiding to a \"significant loss\" into the SepQ for food delivery and local commerce. The results carry symbolism beyond China for the global food delivery landscape with a possible negative impact to sentiment for the sector with the ability for competition to increase so rapidly within a given quarter. However, an equally pertinent question is why do companies want to spend billions to gain market share on this space? And, with a read- across for Prosus' iFood and talabat, will this result in Meituan decelerating/accelerating its international expansion plans?",

For example, consumers in the MENA region generally are less price sensitive than other regions due to a lower cost of delivery and higher affluence, among numerous other factors. When asked on the intensification of competition, Meituan's CEO (Wang Xing) noted on the earnings call that \"Well, allow me to begin with a very clear message. We are firmly against the involution...the regulators have made it very clear\". Regulatory responses are being monitored. In one of Meituan's recently entered geographies, Saudi Arabia, there is draft legislation on ensuring that large food delivery companies charge above the average variable cost per order to prevent aggressive pricing, which could perhaps have positive repercussions for margins in the sector.",

Ultimately, food delivery platforms are broadening/have broadened to be more than just food delivery apps, seeking to become 'on- demand' apps i.e. grocery and other retail categories, presenting large TAM opportunities (and potentially far larger than food delivery in the long term). Those more bullish on the sector could suggest that these apps store valuable consumer data. We see value in food delivery companies but a key industry- wide question that is still unanswered is where long term EBITDA margins will settle, which we see as ultimately defining a spread of bull/bear views of the sector.",

Meituan first expanded outside of China into Hong Kong in 2023 with a 10 year plan to significantly scale international GMV by 2033 (to c. \\(\\) 100bn\\$ in GMV run- rate). Meituan's CEO noted on the earnings call that \"in terms of the expansion phase, so we [are] not in any hurry\". In Hong Kong, Meituan compete against Delivery Hero and latterly Deliveroo (which exited the market last year amid competition). Meituan believe they are \"number one\" in that market now. Meituan expanded into Saudi in late- 2024 and are now in 20 cities by end- July. Last week, Meituan expanded into Qatar (see our report here) and are launching into Brazil to compete against Prosus' iFood which is the dominant market leader there (c. \\(80\\% +\\) share). Meituan noted Brazils a top 5 global market by GMV but that \"competition [is] going to be quite fierce\" and \"we are not in any rush. We want to make sure we do our research\", which possibly implies a slower pace of investment in that specific market than we might have expected - positive for iFood. Meituan has been hiring across other GCC markets since April (see our report here) with our attention also focused on the timing of a potential launch by Meituan into the UAE/Kuwait. We current factor an H2 launch into our modelling for the UAE too - see our report here.",
