Diluted EPS of $0.20 was head of both JEFe/Street of $0.18/$0.11, respectively.** **AFRM continues to lean into their 0% APR products, leading to 37% growth in network volumes.** GMV of $10.4B was above the Street's $9.64B and the guide of $9.40-9.70B, up 43% Y/Y. Total revenue of $876M (+33% Y/Y) was above the Street's $837M and guide of $815-845M, largely driven by 37% increase in network revenue. RTLC of &#36;425M was above the high-end of the guide range of &#36;385-400M, at an RLTC Margin (% of GMV) of 4.1%. RLTC % of GMV was down 17 bps Y/Y, as expected from the mix shift, but above their LT target range of 3-4%. Transaction costs compared to ests at &#36;451M vs cons &#36;443M, while sales and marketing of &#36;80M was better than the Street's &#36;89M forecast. Overall opex was up due to investments in technology and data analytics. Adjusted operating income of &#36;237M beat the consensus of &#36;204M, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 27%, ahead of estimate of 24.4% and the guide range of 23-25%. Provision for credit losses of &#36;157M was roughly in-line with estimates despite higher vols as NCOs improved slightly.The strong credit performance was driven by the increase in 0% APR products, which carry higher FICOs (prime and super prime), and also due to stable overall credit characteristics. Active users of 23.0M increased 24% Y/Y, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of Y/Y acceleration in active users. Active merchants increased to 377K from 358K Q/Q - 24% Y/Y growth. Transactions per active user of 5.8 increased from 4.9 in prior-year quarter.",
