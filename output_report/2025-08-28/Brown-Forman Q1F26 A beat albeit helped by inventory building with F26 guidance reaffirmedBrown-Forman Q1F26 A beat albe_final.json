Group- level performance was solid, with organic growth of \\(+1\\%\\) and reported decline of \\(- 3\\%\\) (due to divestments) coming in \\(\\sim 140\\) bps ahead of us and \\(\\sim 150\\) bps ahead of consensus. It's important to highlight though that this benefited from a sizable \\(+4\\%\\) pts tailwind from increase in distributor inventory, though the implied 'underlying' growth of \\(- 3\\%\\) was still 40bps ahead of our expectations. The beats continued through the P&L, with EBIT coming in \\(5\\%\\) ahead of us and \\(6\\%\\) ahead of consensus. F26 guidance was also reiterated.
