We left the briefing with strengthened confidence in Nongfu's core competitiveness (product innovation/supply chain cultivation) and strong execution for market share gain with agile market investment: 1) Management guided for mid-teens% sales growth in 2025 with GPM and NPM expansion on cost benefits, improving capacity utilization ratio, operating leveraging and disciplined investment; 2) Water: Management noted their water segment has stabilized from last year's social media issues and continues to expand production capacity. We also expect further sales and margin expansion for water segment in 2H25, getting closer to 2023 level. 3) Beverages: Nongfu will focus on continuing roll out of strong new products (focusing on freshness, healthy and catering to changing consumer appetite). Meanwhile, the company will continue to cultivate the vertical supply chain. Over the past decade, it has continued to invest in upstream agricultural supply chain (such as Xinjiang apple bases and Gannan navel orange bases) which have become the company's core competitiveness in the healthy drinks such as fresh juice. 4) Impact from food delivery competition: Company believes the development of FMD industry can also push forward the innovation in RTD beverage industry; in addition management bettves they have edges in its portfolio (sugar-free tea, packaged fresh juice etc.) with competitive pricing and deep channel penetration, making it relatively more defensive vs. other peers amid competition. 5) Capex/Dividend: Company expects yoy higher capex in 2025/2H25 like 1H25 due to capacity additions and newly set up of three natural water origins this year which is core for its competitiveness in water industry. The company will consider its own investment needs, cash flow, and profit situation to provide investors with stable and reasonable returns, on",
