It has achieved the largest UPS (uninterruptible power supply) shipments in China for more than 20 years (per CCID). For Kstar, we expect the company to deliver solid revenue/net income growth, mainly driven by: (1) data center revenue pick- up, riding on increased capex from both SOE and POE hyperscalers and expanding customer base in the domestic data center market, and (2) new energy business recovery benefiting from channel inventories normalization. We view further upside mainly from the data center segment, potentially with (1) further enterprises deploying Deepseek, and the proliferation of AI applications bringing about more data center demand and content value increase of Kstar's products in AIDC compared to a traditional IDC; and (2) continued overseas expansion to address the fast- growing data center capacity buildup demand. We are Buy rated on the stock considering the attractive P/E valuation on its long- term growth profile and better margin and returns vs. peers.",
