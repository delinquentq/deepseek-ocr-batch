      "text": "Management held an earnings call on Aug 28 to address key topics on brand/channel strategy, subsidy, margin and dividend outlook. Our key takeaways include: 1) support from subsidy has faded since May, which mainly impacted sales in higher-tier cities. Management expect to provide company subsidy to support sales to largely flattish in 2H on an easier base, together with deliveries of some front- loaded orders in 1H due to subsidy; 2) Faced with rising secondary property and renovation market, management plan to open more small stores (e.g. in communities) to reach a wider customer base; 3) Management stroke a constructive tone on its overseas expansion; they are not in a hurry to grow sales quickly with a focus on quality in terms of store built- up and product delivery; 4) On margins, management attributed the GPM expansion of wardrobe business to cost reduction and efficiency gains despite widened discounts, while GPM of kitchen cabinet and wooden door was dragged by volume decline and developer channel. Management expect stable margins for wardrobe and sequential improvements for kitchen cabinet and wooden door in 2H25. 5) On dividends, management expect to at least maintain Rmb1,000 per share (same as last year, implying a \\(70\\% +\\) dividend payout based on our estimates).",
