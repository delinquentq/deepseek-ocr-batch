Our understanding from speaking with Drax is that the investigation is at a very early stage, and as such, limited information is currently available. Talking to the company, the preliminary understanding is that the FCA may explore themes similar to those raised by Ofgem, but with a focus on financial disclosures. Also, we understand that the FCA does not have jurisdiction over CfD or RO schemes. Nonetheless, the investigation puts Drax in the spotlight and may bring additional political scrutiny on the post- 2027 bridging mechanism, where Drax agreed heads of terms with the UK government earlier in the year, but the process is yet to be finalised.",
