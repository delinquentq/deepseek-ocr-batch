Still, we view the \\(+2\\%\\) OSG result in 1Q as solid in an absolute sense, and importantly well above most US center-store peers expected to report - LSD% declines while sustained strength in recent scanner trends and incremental coffee pricing provide good visibility into near-term acceleration. We also believe the 1Q volume miss is not reflective of underlying trends given it was dragged down by some temporary issues including promo timing in Sweet Baked Snacks and a tough compare for frozen handhelds/spreads. Moreover, contrary to our initial take this morning, we view the unchanged FY EPS guide as conservative, primarily on embedded coffee elasticity/margin assumptions, which management clarified are reflected in both the \\(- \\$ 0.60\\) EPS headwind from coffee commodity inflation and the - \\$0.50 headwind from tariffs. Bottom- line, we continue to like SJM's stock given what we see as a sustained acceleration in relative OSG momentum vs. food peers, supported by SJM's structurally advantaged portfolio in a challenging environment, idiosyncratic margin drivers into 2H26/FY27, and a highly visible deleveraging story. Post 1Q, we are lowering our FY26 EPS forecast by - LSD% but leaving our FY27 EPS estimate largely unchanged at \\$10.66 ( \\(\\sim 16\\%\\) y/y growth), reflecting a more optimistic outlook on coffee as visibility into margin recovery improves.",
