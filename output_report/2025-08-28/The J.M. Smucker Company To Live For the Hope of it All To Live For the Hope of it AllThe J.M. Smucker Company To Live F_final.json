As recent measured data trends have suggested, SJM's U.S. Retail Coffee segment results are showing upside to expectations as pricing to manage elevated green coffee costs and tariff impact have thus far caused less severe volume elasticity than initially anticipated. This dynamic enabled SJM to beat its initial F1Q26 EPS guidance and also hold on to its FY26 EPS guidance range of \\(8.50 to\\) 9.50 despite an expected doubling of tariff impacts (now a - \\(0.50 impact). That said, both comparable sales growth and EBIT came in below Consensus in the U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads, U.S. Retail Pet Foods, and Sweet Baked Snacks segments. In U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads, net sales tracked behind measured retail dollar sales due to lapping strong distribution gains and merchandising investments for the Uncrustables brand and lapping the strong innovation launch of peanut butter & chocolate spread for Jif. In U.S. Retail Pet Foods, dog snacks remain pressured as consumers continue to be cautious with their spending. So too was Milk Bone lapping distribution gains from its successful peanut butter bites innovation in the prior year. We'd note that, excluding contract manufacturing sales and the retail inventory headwind experienced last quarter, underlying sales for the pet business were down \\~5.5% YOY this quarter vs \\~4.5% YOY in F4Q25, by our estimate. SJM reduced its full year net sales expectations for its dog snacks portfolio by about - \\(10mm\\), roughly around the size of the miss (vs. Consensus), primarily in the Pup- Peroni and Canine Carry Out brands. Last, in Sweet Baked Snacks, while consumption did show sequential improvement, similar to U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads, there was a sizable gap between net sales and scanner results. We think this was largely due to some trade noise.",

To be sure, a good portion of the improvement will be driven by moving past some one- time sales headwinds experienced in F1Q26 and approaching easier year- ago comparisons, particularly in F2H26. But, we are seeing signs of improvement in the consumption data, which ultimately should play out in reported results, and SJM has robust revitalization plans in place for its struggling businesses, namely peanut butter, dog snacks, and sweet baked goods. Net sales growth in the U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads segment is expected to accelerate for the remainder of the year, in part as F1Q26",

Notably, SJM reiterated its belief that Uncrustables will grow +DD YOY and become a \\(1bn+\\) brand this fiscal year. We think SJM remains optimistic about Jif as well. In U.S. Retail Pet Foods, SJM still expects the Milk Bone brand to return to growth in F2H26. This is due in large part to easier comparisons, as the brand is lapping supply disruptions in F3Q26 and inventory destocking in F4Q26, though SJM is also focused on marketing, innovation, and targeted merchandising investments. Last, in Sweet Baked Snacks, while still pressured, SJM is seeing some green shoots on the business. First, the sweet baked goods category is trending in a positive direction and the convenience store channel, in which Hostess over indexes, has shown improving traffic trends. Second, the brand has returned to share growth at several key customers. Third, Donettes, which is 3x larger than Hostess' next sub brand, grew both dollar sales and volume over the last 13-week period. Looking ahead, SJM's actions to stabilize the brand should continue to play out, not to mention easier year-ago comparisons in addition to the trade noise that negatively impacted F1Q26 results normalizing. We believe the company is aiming to return to flat to slightly up YOY sales exiting the fiscal year â€“ consumption is currently at a -MSD YOY level.",

Heading into the year, the planning assumption was that elasticity would be in line with historical levels. However, now a couple of months into its first price increase of the fiscal year (taken in May), SJM has experienced slightly better elasticity. This resulted in the overdelivery of revenue expectations for the coffee business by about \\(\\) 50\\(mm in F1Q26 and has enabled SJM to call up its full year coffee outlook by about\\) \\ \\(100mm\\) . That said, for its recently implemented August price increase, SJM is maintaining its original planning assumption of historical elasticity. Furthermore, SJM discussed the potential for a third price increase this fiscal year, to take place in early winter, to address recent tariff changes, and for this, SJM is anticipating an even greater than historical elasticity factor due to the timing and the sheer magnitude of cumulative price. All said, SJM expects margins to be in a relatively good place exiting FY26, in the mid- 20% range, compared to below 20% in F1Q26 and likely even lower than that in F2Q26.",

That is, while F1Q26 came in about \\(+\\) 0.05 above our estimate, SJM lowered expectations for F2Q26 EPS by more than - 0.30 vs our previous estimate. Furthermore, while the company raised its full year comparable sales outlook by +1pt YOY, we are only increasing our forecast by about +70bps YOY, and are modeling for comparable sales growth at the low end of the updated range. That is, we look for incremental strength in U.S. Retail Coffee to be partially offset by more modest expectations in U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads and to a lesser extent U.S. Retail Pet Foods and Sweet Baked Snacks.",

In U.S. Retail Coffee, the company laid out a +low to mid teens YOY full year comparable sales growth target for the segment. With SJM having delivered \\(+15\\%\\) YOY growth in F1Q26, this suggests a modest deceleration in trends in the remainder of the year. We anticipate a roughly similar level of growth between the remaining three quarters, though with F2Q26 very modestly lower than F3Q26 as it contends with the likely higher elasticity related to the recent August price increase and very slightly higher than F4Q26 as SJM is planning for a third price increase in early winter with even greater than historical elasticity. Notably, with the second price increase now in place, we look for a +mid- 20% YOY price benefit in the quarter. We would expect this to step up to around \\(+30\\%\\) YOY in F4Q26 on the back of the winter price increase, driving a +mid- 20% YOY price benefit for the full year. In U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads, we forecast comparable sales to much more closely align with measured consumption growth than was the case this past quarter. That said, we are taking a more conservative approach than before given the underwhelming F1Q26 result and consumption trends that have been more modest than our previous forecast. Notably, we expect a much greater benefit from price in this quarter compared to last as the list price increase taken on Uncrustables better shows through. In U.S. Retail Pet Foods, we are looking for comparable sales growth, excluding a - 515mm YOY contract manufacturing headwind, to decline - 4% YOY, compared to an \\(\\sim 5.5\\%\\) YOY decline in F1Q26 on a similar basis. This reflects some very modest underlying improvement and the negative impact to F1Q26 from lapping strong distribution gains on innovation in the prior year. We'd expect much more improvement in F2H26 as SJM laps supply disruptions and retailer inventory destocking in F3Q25 and F4Q25 respectively. Last, in Sweet Baked Goods, we estimate comparable sales to be down - MSD YOY, consistent with recent retail sales performance. Notably, while the company is anticipating a return to stabilization exiting the year, we are forecasting a bit more conservatively and estimate comparable sales to still be down YOY in F4Q26.",

Given the aforementioned headwinds in U.S. Retail Coffee, we model for operating segment margins in U.S. Retail Coffee of roughly \\(16.6\\%\\) , well below the full year expectation of low \\(20\\%\\) range and below the F1Q26 outcome. In U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads, we expect flattish YOY profit given the incremental marketing spend, and in U.S. Retail Pet Foods we expect segment profit to be down slightly YOY also due to the investments being made there as well as related to the anticipated sales decline.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
