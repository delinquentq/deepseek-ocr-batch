Earnings are in line with the Street, with 1H accounting for \\(49\\%\\) of FY estimates (inline with last 3Y). Core drivers were steady, with investment income leading the beat in the quarter. The latter tends to be more episodic, hence may not be extrapolated by the Street going forward. The bank delivered flat NII q/q, on \\(1\\%\\) q/q loan growth (up \\(6\\%\\) y/y); with LDR flat at \\(96\\%\\) . CoF improvement appears limited at RHB vs peers, which drove a NIM decline of 3bps to \\(1.81\\%\\) from \\(1.84\\%\\) . Fee income held up q/q, with \\(29\\%\\) y/y growth in trading income driving the non- II beat. Costs were higher than expected, with CIR at \\(47.1\\%\\) . Asset quality was better than feared, especially post AmBank results (link). The bank booked 19bps ann. credit costs (in line with our expectations), with NPL and coverage ratios holding steady q/q.

      "text": "- RHB unveiled its Progress27 Strategy with a path to enhance RoE over the next 3Y through greater profitability, better service delivery and value creation for customers. The bank aims for \\(12\\%\\) RoE by 2027, with CIR of \\(10\\% y/y)\\) . Management also expects open growth to be contained below \\(6\\%\\) each year, resulting in a cumulative cost takeout of RM500mn by 2027.- Management also expects NIMs to stay rangebound at \\(-1.90\\%\\) , along with \\(-15\\) bps credit costs each year over 2025-27. We believe these drivers provide a credible path for RHB to achieve \\(12\\%\\) RoE in 3Y. The bank also guided for \\(>10\\%\\) CASA growth each year, targeting \\(>30\\%\\) CASA ratio by 2027, which appears aspirational.- RHB is also investing in people and technology to grow its WM AUM by \\(>20\\%\\) each year, which appears punchy but is directionally positive for the bank. The bank management clarified that payout would remain at \\(60\\%\\) , and increasing leverage will not be used as a tool to manage RoE, in case RoA measures do not materialize.- Group CET1 ratio of \\(16\\%\\) as of Mar-25 appears high, given medium-term loan growth and profitability estimates at RHB. Management does not plan to consider any measures to optimize capital through higher payouts, buybacks or inorganic growth for the next 3Y. This lack of leverage as a driver can remain an overhang.- SME AQ risks are receding, along with increased recoveries. Further, tighter underwriting in the last few quarters is leading to lower delinquencies and hence credit costs. Recovery from select corporate borrowers is an added tailwind. We forecast credit costs of \\(15 / 18 / 21\\) bps in 2025-27E.",
