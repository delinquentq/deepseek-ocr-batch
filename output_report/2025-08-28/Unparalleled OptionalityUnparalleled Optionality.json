As the Contract Service Margin (CSM) and Risk Adjustment (RA) releases comprise \\(72\\%\\) and \\(14\\%\\) of the underwriting profit, and \\(40\\%\\) and \\(8\\%\\) of the pretax comprehensive income, respectively, we view these as the most important line items. In this regard, the CSM release was \\(+5.9\\%\\) higher than we expected and the RA release was \\(+12.8\\%\\) higher. Moreover, the Non- Life business continues to improve its margins, with the Insurance Service Result (ISR) being \\(+45.9\\%\\) ahead. However, this underlying improvement was offset by Health, where underwriting profits were \\(- 15.7\\%\\) lower than we expected, so that the group ISR was only \\(+0.4\\%\\) ahead. This miss in Health was prompted by higher frequency and severity of medication claims as well as our model underestimating the amortisation of acquisition costs.",

Currently, the holding company has a remarkable net surplus of NIS 1,547m, largely invested in liquid assets, with only NIS 32m in nontradeable debt. One potential use of this is the acquisition of a stake in CAL, where management had hoped to own a \\(49\\%\\) share of the Joint Venture that is seeking to buy Discount Bank's \\(72\\%\\) stake. As regulatory approvals could take a year, we believe that deploying the remaining surplus ought to be a key topic for the next plan.",

With that minimum, Harel's \\(187\\%\\) (or \\(159\\%\\) excluding transitional) appears adequate, meaning that capital generated can be upstreamed to the holding company and used for strategic acquisitions (or buybacks). Hopefully, Harel will consider adopting cash remittance discounts (as Phoenix Financial has) to allow investors to track dividend flows.",

Historically, falling yields were a highly material headwind, with a \\(- 1\\%\\) fall costing NIS - 1,272m (FY24 exposures), while a \\(+1\\%\\) uplift creates a NIS 19m gain. Given that many investors (us and Harel included) believe that cuts are likely, Harel would be incentivised to hedge this. However, the revaluation of liabilities under IFRS 17 means that Harel is overhedged, such that a \\(- 1\\%\\) cut drives a NIS 357 gain, whereas a \\(+1\\%\\) uplift creates a NIS - 400m loss. This creates a dilemma, as the optimal decision (for profits) might be to extend the overexposure to government bonds, whereas reducing the exposure might eliminate the interest rate sensitivity (reducing risk).",
