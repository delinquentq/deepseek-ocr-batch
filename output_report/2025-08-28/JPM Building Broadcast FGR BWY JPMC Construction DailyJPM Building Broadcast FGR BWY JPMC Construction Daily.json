      "text": "Eiffage: Results in- line & guidance confirmed; no incremental positives. Eiffage reported H1 results after market close yesterday followed by a Management presentation. Overall results were in line with our expectations, with H1 EBIT at €1,006m (vs JPM at €1,002m) and net income at €308m (JPM at €283m, but the difference is driven by startu phasing where Eiffage reported an €83m impact on Net Income in H1 (JPM at €116m)). Contracting EBIT was \\(2.4\\%\\) above JPM, driven by Energy, while Concessions EBIT was \\(0.7\\%\\) below our expectations. Order book stood at €29.5bn in Jun- 25 (vs. €28.4bn in Jun- 24), implying order intake levels in Q2 down \\(8\\% y / y\\) (vs. \\(- 10\\%\\) in Q1). Net debt for the period was down at €9.9bn (vs. €10.6bn in Jun- 24), and FCF was - €91m in H1 (vs. €148m in H1 24), driven by a more pronounced seasonal variation in the working capital requirement in Contracting and increased growth investment in Concession, although we note the bulk of FCF is always generated in H2. Eiffage also confirmed their 2025 guidance. Considering the in line print and unchanged guidance we see limited change to consensus estimates, but expect a muted or slightly negative share price reaction today given the lack of incremental positives provided, and considering the French political overhang currently.
