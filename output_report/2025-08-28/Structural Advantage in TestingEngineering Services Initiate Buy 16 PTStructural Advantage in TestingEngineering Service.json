We view the $20mm NV5 cost synergy target as conservative with key opportunities from eliminating duplicative expenses across administrative functions and optimizing sourcing and procurement. Additional margin expansion is expected through cross-selling higher margin services, shedding low-margin contracts, and leveraging NV5's offerings in areas like Geospatial and Infrastructure. With MSD% organic growth and minimal SG&A investment required to support scale, TIC's ability to flex resources efficiently further enhances its margin profile longer term, we see 20%+ EBITDA margins as obtainable on greater pricing (focus historically, on market share gains) and the scale benefits from the continued consolidation of the industry.",

In other words, companies can amortize those costs immediately vs the 5 years domestically they had to amortize these costs for qualified research expenses. Note, the section is retroactive to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. All in, we believe this should boost cash flow and tax efficiency for engineering, software, and industrial services inspection firms like NV5. Section 163 J - this section of the bill changes the limitation of business interest expense deduction to be deducted off of EBITDA vs EBIT, reversing what it was after the Tax Cut and Jobs act. Said another way, the limitation on interest deductibility will now be changed from \\(30\\%\\) of EBIT to \\(30\\%\\) of EBITDA. This section is can be used retroactively to tax years beginning after December 31, 2023. Our view is this is most beneficial for PE backed, industrial, and infrastructure firms which Acuren fits within. Bonus Depreciation - this section fully reinstates bonus depreciation to \\(100\\%\\) for expensing on qualified assets. Qualified expenses include shorter-lived assets and qualified manufacturing structures. Further, we believe this will be retroactive to January 1, 2025 and can be utilized through at least 2030. All in, we believe companies that operate in capital intensive industries (energy, industrial services, infrastructure) are poised to benefit most from this legislation. Our view is this may incentive some companies to also boost capital spending.
