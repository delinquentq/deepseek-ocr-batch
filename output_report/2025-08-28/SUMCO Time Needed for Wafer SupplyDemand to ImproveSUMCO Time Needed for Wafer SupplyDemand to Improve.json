We lower our F12/25-27 profit forecasts as customer inventories are declining more slowly than we anticipated as demand for legacy chips has been slow to recover. Our price target (PT) remains ¥1,200 (F12/26e P/B of 0.7x, historical 5-yr low; our BPS forecast is largely unchanged). The stock is underperforming TOPIX by about 3pp YTD, and performing in the middle range of chemicals sector stocks in our coverage. The stock continues to lack direction, with expectations for wafer S/D to improve as the semiconductor market recovers contrasting with concerns about the magnitude of silicon wafer inventories at chip companies, SUMCO's customers.We believe there is little risk of downside as the stock is trading at a P/B of just under 0.8x our F12/26 BPS forecast, but that it will take time for the share price to recover in earnest since the timeline for a real recovery in 300mm wafer supply/demand appears to be pushed back to 2026 or later. We stay EW.",

We now expect milder growth in depreciation, and revise our JPY/USD assumption for F12/25 3Q onward from ¥140 to ¥145, which positively impacts our outlook. On the other hand, we now expect it to take longer for shipments of 300mm wafers for legacy semiconductors to recover, and expect demand for 200mm wafers for autos and other applications to decline, so lower our forecast. Despite envisioning growth in shipments of 300mm wafers driven by increased demand for generative AI, we expect OP to deteriorate about ¥38bn YoY and swing to a loss due to a large increase in depreciation (we forecast an increase of about ¥35bn) accompanying GF investment. In F12/26, we expect OP to improve ¥8bn YoY, to ¥7bn (down from our previous forecast of ¥20bn reflecting our lowered F12/25 forecast). We expect growth in shipments of 300mm wafers alongside increased demand for semiconductors to offset further growth in depreciation. In** **F12/27, we expect OP to increase ¥37bn YoY, to ¥44bn (previous forecast ¥70bn).** We expect 300mm wafer shipments to continue to rise as the semiconductor market expands, and depreciation to decline ¥20bn.",
