This was a function of lesser topline upside flow- through in SG&A, which mgmt. attributed to intentional marketing investment - a dynamic that will continue into 3Q (more below). In our view, the primary blemish on the 2Q26 print was outsized \\(+15\\%\\) inventory growth (vs. 3Q +HSD % sales growth guidance), which mgmt. somewhat quelled by 1) attributing levels to an intentional tariff- related pull- forward, & 2) reiterating its commitment to manage inventory growth more in- line with sales growth by the end of 3Q.

We see room for possible 3Q26 EPS upside to guidance, as 1) 2Q's +LDD % sales growth performance could continue into 3Q (vs. mgmt. expectation for a deceleration to \\(+HSD\\%\\) ), 2) projected tariff impacts potentially prove overly punitive (as they have for most in 2Q), 3) mgmt. has seemingly built in an SG&A buffer, & 4) 2Q26's below- the- line boosters may selectively recur.

We see room for upside to even revised higher FY guidance for reasons similar to our 3Q view. More specifically, this updated FY outlook embeds 1) a -3 pts 2H growth deceleration from 1H's 11% levels, 2) potentially overly punitive 2H tariff impacts, & 3) room to trim SG&A, if necessary. Thus, we model \\$5.33 FY EPS - +LSD % above \\(\\sim\\) \\$5.20 implied guidance on higher FY sales & GM assumptions (+10% y/y & 35.9% y/y guidance \\(+9\\%\\) y/y & 35.8%).
