The daily reading was at 20 (bullish) on Jul 1st, and fluctuated between 25 (bullish) and 47 (neutral) in the past month due to rising leverage, valuation and positioning. Fund flow is strong, liquidity remains loose, leverage, valuation and positioning are high, while earnings revision is neutral. China onshore markets outperformed offshore (H- share and ADR) and developed markets in the past month. Within China, ChiNext, CSI 500 and CSI 300 outperformed the most, while HSCEI, HSI and Nasdaq Golden Dragon underperformed. We reiterate the barbell strategy: large- cap, high- yield SOEs on the defensive side, and quality beta and earnings compounds on the other side.

      "text": "The analysis of the BofA China A- share Wax & Wane (W&W) Indicator in this report is back- tested and does not represent the actual performance of any account or fund. Back- tested performance depicts the hypothetical back- tested performance of a particular strategy over the time period indicated. In future periods, market and economic conditions will differ and the same strategy will not necessarily produce the same results. No representation is being made that any actual portfolio is likely to have achieved returns similar to those shown herein. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between back- tested returns and the actual results realized in the actual management of a portfolio. Back- tested performance results are created by applying an investment strategy or methodology to historical data and attempts to give an indication as to how a strategy might have performed during a certain period in the past if the product had been in existence during such time. Back- tested results have inherent limitations including the fact that they are calculated with the full benefit of hindsight, which allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted to maximize the returns. Further, the results shown do not reflect actual trading or the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on a portfolio manager's decision- making under actual circumstances. Back- tested returns do not reflect advisory fees, trading costs, or other fees or expenses.",
