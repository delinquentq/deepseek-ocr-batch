Most relevant to our coverage, its Data Center business reported revenues of \\(\\) 41bn\\(, up\\) 5\\% \\(qoq, as strength in Networking demand was partially offset by a decline in H20 GPU sales and a somewhat slower Blackwell ramp (up \\(+17\\%\\) qoq). As such, large CSPs contributed around \\(50\\%\\) of Nvidia's DC business, and the US semis team believes this highlights a broadening of the company's customer base and adoption of the Blackwell GPUs beyond the traditional Hyperscalers. Furthermore, Nvidia pointed towards continued strength in GPU demand from Sovereign compute capacity build- out and the company expects this sovereign demand to contribute c. \\(\\) 20bn\\(of revenue in CY25 (implying 2x yoy increase). More broadly, we see continued demand from Sovereign build- out as a positive for Nebius given the company is actively expanding its global capacity and offers a\\) 20- 25\\%\\$ lower TCO for customers. Additionally, Nvidia stated that its Rubin platform remains on track for launch in mid- 2026, and all 6 constituent chips of this platform have entered pilot manufacturing. As such, we believe that the positive commentary around the broadening of Al demand, contributions from sovereign buildout and on- track production of the Rubin platform is a positive for the overall leading- edge demand, and below we contextualise the implications of Nvidia's earnings and outlook for the European semicap players ASML (Buy), ASMI (Buy), BESI (Buy), as well as European Al infrastructure provider Nebius (Buy).",

While the US government has lifted its ban on shipments of the H20 GPUs and has granted some customer licenses, we note that Nvidia's 3QFY26 guide does not reflect any contributions from China due to continued geopolitical uncertainty.
