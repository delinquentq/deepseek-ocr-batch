Gross order intake in the quarter declined \\(c - 1\\%\\) at ccy (vs. \\(- 2.1\\%\\) cons. & \\(+10\\%\\) in Q1 24/25). Speaking to the company, tariffs constituted a 90bps headwind whilst FX was 100bps headwind to gross margin and they expect the former to worsen and the latter to improve in Q2. Chinese sales were negatively impacted by last year's weak order intake, impacting APAC growth which declined \\(c - 4\\%\\) in ccy, with sales in the region expected to start to recover in the second half of 2025/26. Americas' sales also declined by the same amount (although we do note a tough comparison of \\(+16\\%\\) ), with lower sales in North America a drag to growth as U.S. volumes declined mainly as a result of customers awaiting the Elekta Evo clearance. Overall, a better quarter but we expect the focus to be the softer Q2 commentary on the call. We continue to see uncertainty around US Evo approval and expect limited sales from Evo in the US in FY25/26 (see Q4 Review: US orders an overhang, 29 May). We reiterate our UW rating and prefer Siemens Healthineers (Ow) (see: 2025 outlook: 5 themes for '25, 21 Nov 2024).",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
