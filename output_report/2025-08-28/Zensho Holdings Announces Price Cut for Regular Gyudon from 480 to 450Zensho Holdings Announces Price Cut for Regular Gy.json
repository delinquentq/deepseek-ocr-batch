This price cut from ￥480 to ￥450 for regular gyudon may help reverse the downtrend in customer traffic. In the gyudon industry, a stiff price competition among the three majors occurred post- 2009, eroding profitability in overall industry. Compared to that period when the yen was stronger, a similar scenario is unlikely this time. While the price cut may reduce gross margin, it may be possible for the company to improve OPM with increased sales from higher customer traffic via operating leverage. Thus, we see no need to be overly negative on the price cut.",
