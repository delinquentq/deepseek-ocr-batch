Sales volume totaled 111.1k units, +2.3% yoy and +19.6% qoq, but ASP compressed further to RMB 260k, -6.9% yoy and -2.1% qoq,on weaker product mix (i.e. higher L6 contribution) compared to prior year, alongside intensified promotions including interest subsidies and increased sales incentives.Gross margin slid to 20.1% (vs. 19.5% in Q2 24 and 20.5% in Q1 25) as vehicle margin fell sequentially to 19.4% (vs. 18.7% in Q2 24 and 19.8% in Q1 25), primarily due to elevated promotions. Opex as % of revenue saw modest improvement to 18.3%, vs. 18.4% in Q2 24 and 19.5% in Q1 25, **reflecting effective cost control.** Nevertheless, the lower top line resulted in operating income of RMB 827 mn for the quarter, missing consensus estimates by 13%.

Another major upgrade is scheduled for November, which will bring additional user value creation. VLA incorporates generative AI capabilities, making it more advanced compared to traditional end- to- end approaches. It requires stronger computational power and larger models, particularly at the edge. With continued improvements in model training and computing resources, VLA autonomous driving development is expected to accelerate significantly, with the company targeting L4 autonomy by 2027.",
