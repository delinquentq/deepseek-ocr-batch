Our initial read of this investigation is that it is related to historical disclosures rather than an investigation into biomass sustainability itself - a similar topic to the 2023 Ofgem investigation. Our initial take is that this investigation should not impact Drax's existing subsidies nor the bridging mechanism, especially given the latter is being done for security of supply reasons, and we look forward to seeing more detail from the FCA as well as the government's response to this investigation.",

The investigation concluded that there was an absence of adequate data governance and controls in place that had contributed to Drax misreporting data in relation to its annual profiling submission to Ofgem for the compliance period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022. Drax accepted the findings of the investigation and agreed to pay £25m into Ofgem's Voluntary Redress Fund. Importantly, during this investigation, Ofgem did not find any evidence to suggest that Drax was incorrectly issued with subsidies. The investigation also did not find any evidence suggesting that Drax does not meet the government's threshold that a minimum of \\(70\\%\\) of biomass must come from sustainable sources in order to receive scheme funding.",
