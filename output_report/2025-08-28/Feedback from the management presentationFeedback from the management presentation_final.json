      "text": "Following on from Q1 2025/26 results (ending July) today (see Q1 first take: EBIT beat, Q2 softer, 28 Aug), we attended the management presentation. We highlight three key takeaways: 1) Q2 guidance: Organic growth is not expected in Q2 (versus consensus +4.7% ccy growth) given sales pressure stemming from both the US and China. On gross margin, a similar 90bps drag as in Q1 is anticipated in Q2, although the FX headwind (100bps in Q1) should gradually improve. 2) APAC: In China, the orderbook remains below pre- pandemic levels, although management are seeing a pick- up in orders which is expected to continue. Whilst sales are expected to decline in Q2, growth is expected to recover in fiscal H2. In India, weakness was attributed to the lumpiness of orders by quarters, with management citing the market remains positive and attractive long term, noting below 1 in a price per million in India versus 12 in the US. 3) US: Management continue to work towards FDA approval of Evo. Although the timeline remains unclear, they are hopeful of approval before H2 and noted that whilst approval is assumed in guidance, there are other geographic growth drivers that underpin guidance with US Evo approval not a necessity. US softness in Q1 may have also been partially attributable to market weakness, not just order postponement ahead of Evo approval. Softer expectations around Q2 was a focus on the call today and explains the weakness in the shares c.- 5% (c.- 0.4% SXDP), in our view. We reiterate our UW rating and prefer Siemens Healthineers (OW) (see: 2025 outlook: 5 themes for '25, 21 Nov 2024).",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
