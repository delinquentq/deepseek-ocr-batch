Accordingly,we lower PO 2% to HK&#36;71.8. We maintain our Buy rating for its consistent share gains that can support better-than-peers orderbook visibility, its 30% underperformance vs.HSI Index YTD, undemanding valuation (12.9x 2025 P/E, vs. an average of mid- to high-teens P/E for leading China consumer names), and c.5% dividend yield.",

Its superior supply chain (fast lead time, high production quality, lower cost and strong fabric innovation) supports share gains. For example, Shenzhou's newly launched soccer apparel for adidas has been a huge success, and we expect the series to contribute &gt;30% of its adidas orders in the coming 12 months. Admittedly, we believe its topline strength in 1H25 was partly due to order frontloading (the US +36%/Nike +6% in 1H25). Therefore,Nike's future turnaround pace will likely be key to Shenzhou's share price, in our view.",

We expect its 2H25 GPM to be only marginally better than 1H25 (27.1%), but still below 2024 (28.1%) and pre-COVID level (30%+). Its sales mix shift back to sportswear is positive, but we are concerned with tariffs and China. Various sources suggest Vietnam's new tariff with the US is old tariff+20%, 10% higher than the tariff pause period in 2Q25. We expect Shenzhou to share some tariffs with certain client. In addition, China's sales were -2% in 1H25, and a likely sub-optimal capacity utilization in China may also weigh on margins.Again, Nike's recovery pace will be a swing factor to Shenzhou's 12-month margin outlook, as historically Nike's orders enjoy better margins than others.",
