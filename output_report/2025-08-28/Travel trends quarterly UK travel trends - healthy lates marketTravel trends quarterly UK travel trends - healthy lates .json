It draws level with Booking.com and TUI, which have both slipped (TUI: 13.4% in 2Q). We are more focused on trends than absolute percentages given we know Jet2 has 21% share of total ATOL vs. TUI with 18%. The only other top 10 company on a rising trend is OTB.- Customers are spending: For their Summer '25 holiday, 91% (vs 89% in Q2/88% in Q1) of customers are expecting to pay at least as much as the previous year. Data from Which? that analysed 8k holidays back in January for August travel, found that package holiday prices for Summer 2025 are up an average 4.2%. Our survey responses also indicate there is a noticeable uptick in those who are expecting to pay 'significantly more', partly offset by those looking to pay 'a little more'. We note that the latest ASDA income tracker has seen growth in discretionary income falling during the year (from +11% at the start of the year to just +2% in July), with the lower and middle income quintiles particularly under pressure, offset by strong growth for the top income quintile.",

OTB commentary: Positive snippets in the press (Telegraph/Financial Times 24 August/25 August). \"firm's summer bookings had climbed to record levels, as low and middle- income earnings use credit cards and cheaper airports instead of foregoing their summer break\"... \"destinations such as Tunisia and Turkey, where accommodation is relatively cheap and the pound goes far, have seen a surge in demand\"... \"demand for package holidays is greater than it's ever been\". easyJet commentary: At its Q3 results (17 July), it guided to deliver more than 235m PBT in FY25 for easyJet Holidays and committed to setting a new medium- term target at the end of the year. It also flagged a late booking pattern; \"the trend towards later bookings continues to be seen\".

The Travel Network Group noted that average booking values \"remained higher\" albeit \"more customers holding back or shopping around due to price sensitivity\".

With a later booking profile, the lates markets is becoming increasing relevant. It last reported on 9 July saying i) summer seat capacity \\(+8.0\\%\\) to 18.5m seats; ii) bookings continue to be made closer to departure; iii) demand remains strong providing pricing is attractive; and iv) trading in line with market expectations (at the time 579m PBT and still unchanged). We expect the late booking profile has continued over the last seven weeks (evidenced by high Barclaycard transaction data), which we think is partly a function of consumer confidence, which still remains fragile. Our most recent air fare tracker shows that Jet2 average pricing for 60d advance fares has fallen to \\(- 1\\%\\) for September departures, which are booked in July. This would be relatively consistent with comments made by management in July that the previous few weeks had seen pricing on seat- only soften in the previous 4- 6 weeks. For FY26, we forecast \\(8\\%\\) capacity growth, with flight bookings/ price \\(+20\\% / + 1\\%\\) respectively and package holidays bookings/ price \\(+4\\% /2.6\\%\\) respectively, ie implying a further reduction in FY26 package- flight mix (- 4.8ppt to \\(63.5\\%\\) ). Whilst we only forecast flat PBT at 568m, this reflects lower interest income, with our EBIT forecast reflecting a much healthier \\(+9\\%\\) yoy.",

For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Unlike an actual performance record based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.",

Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within the Deutsche Bank Group. Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in research reports published by Deutsche Bank AG. Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of Deutsche Bank AG. It should be noted that the decision to incorporate ESG factors into any investment strategy may inhibit the ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with your investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.",
