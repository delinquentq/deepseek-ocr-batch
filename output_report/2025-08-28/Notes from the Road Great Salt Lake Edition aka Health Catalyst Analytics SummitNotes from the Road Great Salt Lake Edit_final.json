Our key takeaway from the event was that there is a lot going on under the surface as the company continues to roll out Ignite, evolve its portfolio of offerings to better meet clients' needs in the current environment, and right- size the cost structure. While our revenue estimates remain unchanged vs. 2Q earnings (- 1.6% org in '25, 1.7% in '26, and 3.0% in '27), we are raising our EBITDA estimates as HCAT's current cost cutting program materializes, which should result in \\(\\sim\\) 60 MM of EBITDA in 2026. Given this improved margin profile, we are raising our price target to \\$4 (6x '26 EBITDA), but retain our In- Line rating on shares given the still- challenging demand environment.",
