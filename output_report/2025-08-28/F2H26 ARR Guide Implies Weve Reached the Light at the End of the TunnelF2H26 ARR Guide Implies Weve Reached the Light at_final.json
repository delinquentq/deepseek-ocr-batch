The number of deals with total deal value over \\(\\) 10M\\(doubled yoy, and the average Flex customer account remains above\\) \\ \\(1M\\) in ARR. Flex contract utilization exceeded \\(75\\%\\) with Reflexes occurring just five months after initial Flex subscriptions, on average. In one example, CRWD completed a \\(\\) 10M+\\(reflex of a contract with 18 months remaining. Additionally, management's comments implied >50 new Reflex customers in F2Q, which now make up nearly 10% of the Flex customer base. Reflexes are resulting in a \\~50% increase to Flex customer ending ARR. We view these developments as a bright spot on CRWD's earnings and expect Flex/Reflex to drive continued momentum.",
