Delta, for example, spoke of tourists putting off visits to Europe in peak summer, deferring travel to the autumn given high temperatures and high peak hotel prices. For travellers who can avoid school holidays, they suggest demand for autumn is robust. TUI's commentary was also notably more robust for winter tour operator trends than for peak summer, although it is worth noting that the TUI winter commentary was weighted to UK travel, which books earlier than Germany and has proven brighter through the summer.",

The advantage of our three- stage DCF model is that it takes into account our explicit forecasts for the coming five years, rather than just as single year. The valuation is also explicit about the assumed mid- term profitability of the business. The valuation method does not include a terminal value. Our Ryanair €28.0 price target is based on a mid- term EBIT margin of \\(15.0\\%\\) and a WACC of \\(7.3\\%\\) .",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
