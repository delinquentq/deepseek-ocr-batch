      "text": "We reiterate our Neutral rating and raise our Price Target to \\(\\) 320\\(vs.\\) \\ \\(300\\) prior) following Autodesk's F2Q26 results that saw Revenue come in \\(+2.2\\%\\) above Consensus, Oplnc \\(+6\\%\\) , EPS \\(+7\\%\\) and FCF \\(+103\\%\\) . The stock is indicated \\(+11\\%\\) AH, reflecting the stronger- than- expected outperformance, particularly core accelerating to \\(11\\%\\) CC growth ex. Transaction Model (TM), as well as upward revision to both F26 CC Revenue growth guidance (from \\(8 - 9\\%\\) to \\(9 - 10\\%\\) ex. TM) and F26 CC Billings growth guidance (from \\(16 - 18\\%\\) to \\(17 - 19\\%\\) ex. TM). We acknowledge several positives from the quarter: 1) Autodesk's continued momentum from the new Transaction Model (7pp. growth contribution in 2Q vs. 5pp. in 1Q), 2) Improving new business momentum from channel partners on the back of GTM optimization phased in at the start of the year, 3) AI prioritization and adoption momentum, with Autodesk's AI model delivering \\(>1.2M\\) dimensions via AutoConstrain and Fusion. While we take credence in Autodesk's initial F29 OpM guide of \\(41\\%\\) and see potential for the company to execute on this goal, we prefer to await further clarity around other elements of the long- term strategic framework (upcoming Investor Day on Oct. 7th). We further look for proof points that Autodesk can sustainably accelerate core Revenue growth above high- single digits and solidify a healthier growth trajectory. Specifically, we see the following factors as key to the path for reacceleration: ACC and Fusion 360, AI product velocity and monetization, and increased cross- sell and upsell momentum post Transaction Model implementation.",
