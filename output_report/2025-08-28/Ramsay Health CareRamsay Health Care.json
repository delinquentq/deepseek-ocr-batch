The UK was also a miss due to a weaker result from Elysium. These results were offset by better numbers from Europe, the business which we expect to be sold. No meaningful guidance was provided for the operations but a new public hospital at Joondalup Hospital in WA is expected to reduce EBIT by \\(\\) 37m\\((- 6.4\\%)\\) of FY24 underlying AUS EBIT).
