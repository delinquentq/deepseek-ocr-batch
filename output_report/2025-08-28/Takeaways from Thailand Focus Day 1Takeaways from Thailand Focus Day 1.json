On the country's competitiveness, the Board of Investment (BOI) highlighted Thailand's current strengths on infrastructure (energy & digital readiness), FTAs, STEM talents, and tax incentives. CP Group and Huawei echoed strong demand for data center investment and digital services in Thailand. Although tariffs and trans- shipment are ongoing, they see this as an opportunity to rebalance local supply chains. Regulators are trying to improve investor confidence in capital markets by focusing on better governance, stronger surveillance, and more consistent enforcement, as well as promoting tax- saving funds and mandatory provident funds to support long- term participation. Addressing household debt requires both short- term and long- term strategies as interest rate cuts alone cannot solve the problem. In the near term, the panelists discussed that targeted measures such as expanding the capacity of AMCs, offering soft loans, and providing regulatory flexibility can help restructure distressed debt.",

The panelists agreed that the root causes lie in (1) low financial literacy, (2) weak information transparency, (3) the large share of informal workers who cannot access formal credit, (4) inadequate social safety nets (e.g., high medical costs driving informal borrowing), and most importantly, (5) slowing income growth, which prevents households from servicing their debt.",

The sales volume decline manifested in 2022- 2023 suggests the existence of volume risk. PTTGC is also exposed to forex swings and regulatory risks (via its refinery unit and its ethane contract with PTT).",

We ascribe a target P/E of 12.7x on core 2025E EPS while our target EV/EBITDA is 8.2x on 2024E EBITDA. Both are the average of the global oil retail comp with a 15% discount, reflecting PTTOR's lower- than- peers non- oil exposure. Our DCF is based on WACC of 9.3%, a beta coefficient of 0.9, and zero terminal growth rate (which we think is appropriate given the long- term threat of EV proliferation). The average oil retail marketing margin and oil commercial margin are Bt1.01/liter and Bt1.0/liter respectively. The average oil retail volume sales is at 17,715 liters/year (15- CAGR of 2.6%). The effective tax rate is assumed at 20%.",
