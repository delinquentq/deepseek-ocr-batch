But conversations in New Delhi at the end of last week make it clear that the tariffs are primarily the consequence of the American president's \"personal pique\" that he was not allowed to play a role in seeking to end the long running acrimony between India and Pakistan following the four- day military conflict between the two countries in May. India has never accepted third party intervention in its relations with Pakistan and this remains a \"red line\" despite the economic costs of depriving the \\(47^{\\text{th}}\\) American president of one of his opportunities to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The other point is that no Indian government, including the current government, is going to open up agriculture to imports given the devastating impact it would have on many poor people. As noted by Jefferies' India office recently, nearly 250m farmers and related labour derive their incomes from agriculture with the sector accounting for nearly \\(40\\%\\) of India's workforce (see Jefferies research Indo- US Tariffs Tensions Escalating, 6 August 2025).",

So the draconian tariffs India now faces is the result of an unfortunate series of events, compounded by the fact that Trump has not ended the Ukraine conflict as he stated he would do. As a result, India's continuing purchases of Russian oil has again become an issue, as also previously discussed here. But the reality is that everyone in the Indian capital understands that the real issue is the refusal to allow Donald Trump's personal intervention in the Pakistan issue. This is a classic example of where the \"conceptual vacuum\" in Washington (see GREED & fear - Conceptual vacuum, 14 August 2025) is not in the national interest since it is surely not in America's interests to push India closer to China, a trend which was already happening with direct flights between the two countries due to resume as early as September after more than five years. Meanwhile India needs China's cheap goods, for example solar panels, with China imports into India now running at an annualised US\\(118bn or 16\\%\\) of India's total imports and growing by \\(13\\%\\) YoY in the 12 months to July (see Exhibit 2).",

He also noted, as previously discussed here, that China remains the bigger buyer of Russian oil. Meanwhile, the latest sign of Trump's desperation for a meeting with President Xi Jinping is his announcement on Monday of his sudden willingness to allow 600,000 Chinese students into American universities (see New York Times article: \"Trump Says He Welcomes Chinese Students, as His Administration Blocks Them\", 26 August 2025).

A good example is air conditioners where the rate is due to be cut from 28% to 18%. The last time GST was adjusted in January 2019, albeit in only a very small way, it proved self- financing. It is worth recalling that GST, first introduced back in July 2017, has been one of many benchmark reform achievements in Narendra Modi's 11 years in government. Total GST collections have risen by an annualised 11.1% from Rs11.8tn in FY19 to Rs22.1tn in FY25 ended 31 March and are up 10.7% YoY to Rs8.2tn in April- July 2025 (see Exhibit 10).

While deposit growth has been stable in recent months running at around 10% YoY (see Exhibit 16). Meanwhile, the view of Jefferies' India banking analyst Prakhar Sharma is that CASA ratios have bottomed and should rise as term deposits are low and liquidity levels have improved. The CASA ratio of the ten large banks under Jefferies coverage has declined from 45% in 4QFY22 to 37% in 3QFY25 and 1QFY26 ended 30 June (see Exhibit 17).",

Meanwhile the positive point in India, relative to other large Asian economies such as China and Indonesia where nominal growth has disappointed of late, is that there has been no popular disengagement from the Indian stock market. Contrast this with Indonesia where equity mutual fund assets have declined by \\(57\\%\\) since peaking at the end of 2018 (see Exhibit 18).",
