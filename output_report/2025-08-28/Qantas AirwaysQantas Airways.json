Full- year EBIT of \\(\\) 2.64bn\\(was 2.4\\%\\) ahead of our estimate, while NPAT was a 5.7\\% beat. A special dividend of 9.9cps was announced, taking the full- year DPS to 52.8cps. There does appear to be sharper cost pressure in areas such as \"Same Job, Same Pay\" (SJSP), Entry- Into- Service (EIS) and industry costs (airport fees and infrastructure). Operating guidance suggests another year of headline growth, with capacity and RASK set to grow across the business. These positives should be sufficient to offset any nascent concerns around emerging cost pressures.",
