Third party insurer direct % of exchange GPW was in- line with our estimates at 27%, while ARX retained GPW of 6% was 2pp lower than our 8% estimate. The Underwriting segment net loss ratio of 72.7% missed our estimate of 53.9% by a material amount, but the ceded loss ratio (underwriting performance passed on to risk capital partners) was not provided in the release. Overall, we see the key positives as GPW continues to be very strong and ARX retained premium % of 6% is better than expected, with the negative being the loss ratio and the extent to which this level of losses was passed onto risk capital partners.",
