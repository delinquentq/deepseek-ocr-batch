Importantly, management cited 4 key drivers supporting operating margin expansion YOY in FY26 relative to FY25's \\(\\sim 16.7\\%\\) base, including (1) YOY dual tailwind from tariffs, as FY26 will no longer be burdened by \\(145\\%\\) China tariff rates nor Canada reciprocal tariffs based on current trade policy; (2) revenue growth acceleration opportunity under CEO Heaf (packaging/labeling, marketing, digital, distribution) with a firm commitment to cost discipline holding the fixed cost leverage points in the business at 2.5-3.5% revenue growth supporting favorability on flow-through on revenue growth upside; (3) YOY tailwind within SG&A expenses cycling 1x costs associated with the leadership transition/strategic investments (i.e. consulting fees); and (4) continued opportunity to drive improved merchandise margins over time (w/ FY25, by our math, already executing \\(\\sim 90\\) bps of improvement in merchandise margin expansion YOY).

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analyst's coverage universe.
