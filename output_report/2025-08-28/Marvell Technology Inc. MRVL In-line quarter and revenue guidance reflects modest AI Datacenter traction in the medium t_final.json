      "text": "Key stock takeaways: We expect the stock to trade lower following an in- line quarter with guidance that was in line with the Street on revenue, but modestly above on margins and EPS. We believe investor expectations were low heading into the quarter and positioning was likely cautious; however, we believe the lack of revenue upside in guidance reflects a lack of near- term traction for Marvell's Datacenter custom silicon products. From here, we believe stock performance is likely to hinge on the magnitude of Marvell's custom compute ramp in 2026. We remain Neutral rated on the stock as we think Marvell is likely to gain limited traction through 2026 as a result of content loss in its largest customer silicon customer (Amazon), and ahead of the anticipated product ramp with Microsoft. We could be more constructive on the stock if we gain more visibility into the company's Al revenue trajectory over the next two years.",
