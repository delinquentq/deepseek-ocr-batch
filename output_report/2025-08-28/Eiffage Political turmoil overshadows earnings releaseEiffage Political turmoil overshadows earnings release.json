FCF was lower due to higher seasonal WC outflows of £892m in 1H25 (vs £672m in 1H24, and vs our estimate of £750m). 4) Eiffage ended 1H25 with net debt of £9.9bn (£9.4bn as of end-Dec 2024),reflecting DPS payments and the slightly negative FCF due to the seasonal effect. 5) The Contracting backlog was robust at £29.5bn (+2% ytd; -0.7% vs 1Q25).",

      "text": "Bemstein view. The 1H results published yesterday after market close were mixed, combining a beat on NP but a slight miss at EBIT level on higher holding costs (see Exhibit 2). The slightly negative 1H FCF was explained by larger WC outflows and increased growth in investment in Concessions (new infra projects). In our view, the short- term focus remains on the domestic political uncertainty (Bayrou, vote of confidence on 8 September) on which visibility remains very limited at this stage. In last few trading days, French stocks have been under pressure as renewed political uncertainty is weighing on investor sentiment. For the second consecutive year, late August has brought turbulence to Paris, with looming budget negotiations once again highlighting the differences between the various blocs. On Monday, Prime Minister Mr Bayrou unexpectedly announced a vote of confidence for early September, raising fears that the government could collapse if it fails to secure parliamentary backing (central scenario). We do not see the 1H results driving a significant change in Street consensus' annual estimates. We have an Outperform rating on the stock with a €158.9 PT. For our investment case, see our report of 18 Mar 2025 - Eiffage: We still see a substantial value gap.",
