Income \\((+4.3\\%)\\) and FCF \\((+3.1\\%)\\) . The price action likely reflects the shortfall on ARR vs. Consensus \\((- 1.1\\%)\\) and tempered initial Revenue/FCF growth outlook. Yet, NNARR would have been higher if not for a small minority of larger deals with atypical contract terms that can defer ARR contributions and create Q/Q volatility. This is purely mechanical, not reflective of degradation in underlying business momentum. Note the new ARR methodology implies \\(+14\\%\\) NNARR growth vs. \\(- 8\\%\\) under the prior. Stepping back, results and guidance validated our thesis that Nutanix is primed to benefit from a multi- year displacement cycle and extend its lead in hybrid multi- cloud. New logo adds were robust \\((+19\\%\\) on a tough compare) and Dell PowerFlex contributed two G2K logos just one- quarter into launch. Further, initial FY Revenue guidance was solid despite contending with a slower ATR pool, Fed uncertainty and duration headwinds; a repeat of large, longer- duration land/expand deals (akin to FY25) would be a mechanical upside lever re: duration. We view the guidance as a compelling launch point with room to the upside given: 1) Scaling partnership opportunities with Cisco, Dell and Pure Storage (likely F2H26), 2) VMware customers that renewed pre- Broadcom acquisition are approaching the renewal window, potentially benefiting Nutanix's pipeline generation and conversion, and 3) Broader cross- sell opportunity with NCM, NKP, NC2, etc. With prospects for mid- to- high- teens growth and compounding FCF/Share, we see an attractive risk- reward at 19x FY27 EV/FCF.

      "text": "Our ThesisWe view Nutanix as a key modernization play for enterprises navigating legacy infrastructure transitions. Nutanix's Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) platform delivers a cloud- like operating model to on- prem environments by unifying compute, storage, and networking into software- defined stack – offering \\(40\\% + \\text{TCO savings}\\) , faster provisioning, and hybrid deployment flexibility. Nutanix is well- positioned to extend its HCI level with a large base of three- tier enterprise environments ripe for modernization and a multi- year tailwind from VMware disruption post- Broadcom. Pricing, support, and packaging changes have prompted many customers - especially outside top- tier accounts - to explore alternatives. We estimate a \\(300 - 600M ARR capture opportunity over four years (+3 - 6\\% \\text{CAGR, FY25 - FY29})\\) from this displacement. A ramping partner ecosystem (Dell, Cisco, Pure Storage) is accelerating enterprise reach and reinforcing platform maturity. More compelling is Nutanix's evolution into a hybrid multi- cloud orchestration platform with a growing portfolio addressing key IT priorities - cloud mobility, infrastructure automation, and AI enablement. We believe Nutanix is poised to become a hybrid multi- cloud standard, enabling broader workload coverage, higher multi- product attach, and deeper consolidation - all supportive of at least mid- teens ARR/revenue growth with a strong FCFM profile (28\\% +).",

Addressing a \\(76B TAM (CY26)\\) across both core HCI and various adjacent market opportunities - Kubernetes, database automation, cloud portability, on- prem Gen- AI inferencing - we believe the company is uniquely positioned to sustainably capture incremental share of a growing market opportunity. Our view is predicated on several dynamics: 1) Nutanix is already the industry standard in HCI Software ( \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) market share, per Gartner); the company can build upon its pole position as enterprises increasingly look to NCI to modernize their data center footprints, translating to hard dollar cost savings and increased flexibility, 2) Broadcom's acquisition of VMware is driving customers to re- evaluate their relationship with the company; Nutanix is uniquely positioned to take advantage of increased VMware churn risk with its enterprise- grade hybrid multi- cloud portfolio, and 3) Nutanix's product velocity is unlocking new wallet share expansion opportunities that can complement its core HCI motion (incl. multi- threaded expansion motion). More broadly, we believe Nutanix's core unified stack, vendor neutrality (across hardware and cloud providers) and ease- of- use are key platform characteristics that resonate with customers, translating to consistently high retention rates (GRR \\(>90\\%\\) ). Lastly, we point to Nutanix's strong unit economics (FCFM expanded from \\(1\\%\\) in FY22 to \\(28\\%\\) in FY24), which we believe will continue to fuel steady margin expansion mid- term (+100 bps), particularly as Nutanix recoups incremental leverage from an expanding renewals mix (still \\(",
