We model 2,000 B300 and 100 GB units in 2026 ( \\(\\sim\\) 68MW server power in total), a capacity that can be easily absorbed within Malaysia's expanding 6GWD C pipeline. Meanwhile, stronger general server demand in 2H25 (47K units for FY25 vs 30- 40K guided) and moderating R&D expenses should partially cushion near- term softness. The ramp- up of optical transceivers (200- 400G modules) from 4Q25 is on track and could provide a slight uplift in product mix. We moderate our forecasts and extend our PT timeframe to June- 26 with a lower price target of RM2.40, based on 23x 12M EPS. Maintain OW.",

With the Hopper series (i.e., H200) approaching end- of- life, and another small batch (we estimate c.500 units based on inventory levels) of B200 deliveries in 3Q25, we anticipate an air pocket in 4Q25 for AI server contributions, given that the qualification process for the B300/GB series will take time and may only materialize in 1Q26. We are modeling 2,000 units of B300 and 100 units of GB series in our 2026 estimate, translating to 68MW of server power (or 42MW actual server power excl. redundancy).
