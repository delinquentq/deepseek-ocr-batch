Fully- year guidance is unchanged as drawing down of the cost buffer and changes in FX assumptions help offset tariff effects that are now reflected in the plan. In real terms, the firm has lowered its forecasts for sales relating to printing (DWP/PP; FY assumptions for hardware are - 3% for office use, flat for production). 2) DWP/PP: Tariffs had a limited impact on office printing in 1Q, when sales of 1st- party products increased, but effects on demand will bear watching from 2Q following price increases. PP business felt the effects of a wait- and- see stance on investment by customers. 3) Industry: The fall in sales revenue in 1Q was due to dropping out of accelerated demand for functional materials seen in F3/25 (confined to 1Q) and lower demand for IJ components for China. 4) Imaging solutions: Losses contracted due to lower depreciation following last year's writedowns, and effects of restructuring.
