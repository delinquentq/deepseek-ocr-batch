We attended the company's on- site briefing and mgmt meeting on Aug 28. The company updated guidance which now looks for a MSD%- HSD% decline for full- year 2025 amid still slow consumption recovery into 2H and prolonged raw milk S/D cycle, while expecting high value- add new products (nutrition drinks/HMO products etc.) and category development (cheese/ice cream's sales/margin both improved YoY) to drive long- term profitability. Mgmt also maintained guidance for a largely flatish core OPM for full- year 2025 vs. 2024 (1H25 expansion at 150bps, 2H25 lapping tough comp). The company also plans to make an additional HK\\\\$1bn share repurchase while maintaining a largely stable dividend payout in the near term. With the stock trading at 11.4X/10.5X on 2025E/2026E recurring P/Es on updated GSe with improving FCF yield (8.4%/11.4%), and dividend yield at 3.6%/4.6% (or 5.5% in 2026 factoring share buyback), we maintain our Buy rating.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
