Operating profit was flat y/y, \\(9\\%\\) below GSe, mainly impacted by lower gross margin at \\(59.1\\%\\) , vs \\(60.6\\%\\) in 1H24, due to revenue mix from VBP- ed product, now at \\(66.3\\%\\) of domestic sales, vs \\(57.0\\%\\) in 1H24, that carries slightly lower margin, where (1) weaker spine/trauma sales (- \\(26.5\\%\\) y/y), 2) price cuts in certain knee SKUs, e.g. uni- compartmental knee replacement (单髁), (3) deferred high- margin overseas sales due to custom clearance delays. SG&A ratio remained stable at \\(16.9\\%\\) , versus \\(17.2\\%\\) in 1H24, where the cost saving from an operating efficiency gain offsets the one- off relocation costs for new factory. Net profit of Rmb161mn, compared to higher than GSe Rmb154mn, mainly supported by higher government subsidy income and grants for research and development projects received at Rmb18.3mn vs Rmb2.9mn in 1H24. Operating cash flow at Rmb200mn, improved versus 1H24 of Rmb96mn, on better working capital management, mainly on lower inventory days (301, from 368), offsetting lower payable days and higher receivables days. Management reiterated FY25 earnings guidance (in line with Bloomberg consensus, at Rmb330mn- 340mn), citing expected acceleration in revenue and margin recovery in 2H, implying \\(+26\\% - 33\\%\\) growth for NP in 2H25.",
