We find Bharti & Jio best placed in the space and maintain Buy on Bharti and RIL (parent- co of Jio). We consider potential mobile tariff hike (est. in 1HCY26) to be a catalyst for the sector. At our POs, Jio trades at FY27E EBITDA of 12.2X vs Bharti at 13.3X. The likely discount for Jio vs. Bharti is due to better margins and FCF for Bharti vs Jio. As FCF of Jio starts to improve, we expect the valuation gap to narrow.",

This is because, the RWA permissions, cable deployment etc takes time. FWA allows telcos to circumvent these issues & meet the increasing demand. This is because high- speed 5G service gives similar speeds as fixed broadband without any deployment issues. We hence believe FWA would be able to expand the TAM for home broadband. We believe FWA potential market size could be \\(100\\mathrm{nm + }\\) homes vs c. 30- 40nm TAM of fixed broadband. Jio & Bharti are the only two telcos who are offering FWA services in India.",

FWA is mainly offered in areas where there is no fixed broadband - especially beyond the top 50 cities. Our checks indicate that between Jio & Bharti, Jio is currently leveraging UBR technology with point-to-multi-point radios. The key advantages of deploying UBR include: 1) Dynamically adjust between uplink and downlink capacity. This especially helps FWA as downloads are higher; 2) Risks of running out of capacity is not there as UBR has sufficient capacity; 3) It is economical cost-wise is UBR band is an unlicensed one. As per Jio, many of its FWA users are using UBR technology now and get c.1 Gbps plus speeds.

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least \\(10\\%\\) and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0- 12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).",
