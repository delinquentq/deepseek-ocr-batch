Despite a supplier's increased forecast, we think this is due to OUS demand, not a US return. Speaking with PHIA, competitors, distributors, and other contacts, we think an early-/mid- '26 return is unlikely, seeing '27+ as more reasonable.",

As a reminder, PHIA recalled certain ventilators, bi- level PAPs, and CPAPs in June '21, and a federal court entered a consent decree with Philips Respironics in April '24. KE noted it was selected as the sole supplier for PHIA's respiratory care and higher- level assemblies business, with most production occurring in Thailand. Previously, KE was doing printed circuit board assemblies but is now doing full and final assembly, noting PHIA previously had its own footprint in the US. KE will be doing this for all of PHIA's manufacturing now, with PHIA not doing 'any of it'. KE expects 'modest growth' in the medical business.",

Contract mfgs like KE would also still be subject to the consent decree. At the same time, in our discussions with other industry players, there have been no signs from customers that PHIA is coming back (soon) or building a salesforce. At this stage, we do not expect PHIA to come back for at least another 1- 2 years. Other experts have noted it could take 5- 7 years, with PHIA referencing an average consent decree has a 5- year window, but an injunction could be lifted earlier; see our deep dive here.",
