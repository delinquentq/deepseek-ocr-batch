Its plan expected €150-250m EBITDA for a 200MW fully operational datacentre, of which Iberdrola was to own 20% in exchange for a powered land. Assuming the \\(20x+\\) EV/EBITDA multiples at which global data centres trade and the €2bn+ capex required by the JV to build the datacentre, we estimate a €1.5m/MW+ equity upside for Iberdrola from the JV stake, as contributed assets (real estate, grid connection permit, substation) should have a marginal book value in comparison.",

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least \\(10\\%\\) and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).",
