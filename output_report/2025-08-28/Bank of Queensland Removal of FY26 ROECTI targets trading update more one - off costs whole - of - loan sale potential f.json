Unfortunately, the trading update provides no insight into how much of the better profit performance relates to lower credit costs vs operational performance. A capital- efficient transaction had previously been discussed by the company, but there is no detail and such a transaction is unusual for a bank that is not growing quickly and does not have a strong distribution capability.",

The mid-point of this guidance is \\(-2\\%\\) ahead of Bloomberg consensus of \\$374m and JPMc \\$371m. BOQ also anticipates FY25 cash ROE uplift of between 50bps and 70bps on FY24 levels \\((5.7\\%)\\) , still a very long way from the previously expected \\(8\\%\\) for FY26. The trading update is very high level so we cannot pinpoint what drove this slightly better outcome, however we suspect it was driven by a more benign impairment expense outcome consistent with the BEN result earlier this week. JPM View: We currently forecast 4bps BDD/GLA for FY25 due to a pick up hoh from 1bp in 1H25 to an estimated 8bps in 2H25. We estimate that if the BDD/GLA was \\(\\sim 5\\) bps in 2H25 (and we didn't change our other assumptions), this would put profit slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range.",

This is in line with the guidance previously issued of \\$115m to \\$125m pre tax. BOQ will also see restructuring costs of \\$25m post-tax driven by ongoing operating model simplification. From FY26, all restructuring costs driven by simplification and transformation of the business will be included in ordinary operating expenses. Finally, BOQ will see a \\$14m post-tax increase to the provision relating to works required under the 'Enforceable Undertaking with Austrac. This follows an updated assessment of remedial activities to complete the program. JPM view: The two new provisions are large in the context of BOQ and we estimate the two new provisions would take \\(\\sim 10\\) bps off BOQ's CET1 ratio. This would further pressure BOQ's capital position, and may actually necessitate the capital efficient transaction flagged by management.",

BOQ has a bold cost- out plan (productivity program, OMB conversion) and transformation program, which should support good NPAT growth in FY25. However, beyond this, earnings growth flattens out given headwinds such as: 1) negative mortgage growth as BOQ pulls back from Broker; 2) normalisation of credit costs from very low levels. Stepping back, we see a very real risk that the disruption will have a meaningful impact on the franchise and revenue generation. Management's FY26 ROE and cost/income ratio targets still look very unrealistic to us, relying on an improvement in mortgage market competition that we do not expect to occur. In addition, cost programs/OMB conversions increase risks/uncertainties, especially with quite a tight capital position.",
