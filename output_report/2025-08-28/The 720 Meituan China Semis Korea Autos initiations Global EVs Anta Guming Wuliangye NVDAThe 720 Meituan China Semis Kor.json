On the positives, we note 1) Meituan's food delivery/instashopping volume growth have accelerated further, and its food delivery unit economics advantage has widened further vs. other players, and 2) the 'intensity' of competition is showing signs of peaking in 3Q for the industry, where we note Meituan has seen improved unit economics for Aug (vs. July).

Shenzhou reported a slight 1H25 revenue beat (3% higher) but OP miss by 1% due to lower- than- expected GPM /OPM from labor cost hike (miss GSe by 0.3pp/0.9pp respectively). We came away from the analyst meeting with mixed takeaways: on the positive side, we are encouraged by the company's still on- track order book thanks to solid wallet share gain at key accounts and a low sales exposure to US market etc., which demonstrates Shenzhou's resiliency compared to the broader OEM universe. On the other hand, a key investor focus - GPM recovery trajectory appears slower- than- expected, which in our view reflects the labor cost hikes in China that can't effectively be passed through to customers, unfavourable product mix/customer mix, and the company's efforts to solidify relationship with customers amid the choppy global demand environment. 12m TP of HK\\$74.
