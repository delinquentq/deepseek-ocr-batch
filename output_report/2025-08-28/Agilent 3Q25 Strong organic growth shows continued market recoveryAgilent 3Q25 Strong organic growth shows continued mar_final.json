Often, LC instruments are attached to a Mass Spectrometer that identifies the purified component by measuring its mass-to-charge ratio.GC &amp;amp; GC-MS (19%, $750M)Gas Chromatography is like LC, but it separates a mixture of gases rather than liquids. GC is common in industrial/applied applications.(59% $4.0B)Spectroscopy (15%, $600M)Spectroscopy helps identify compounds by measuring the spectra produced when matter interacts with or emits electromagnetic radiation.Cell Analysis (11%, $450M)Cell analysis instruments are generally designed to study living cells. This includes cell counters, cell analyzers/imaging systems, and flow cytometers. Built primarily from M&A since 2015 and is applicable to many novel modalities.Consumables (25%, $1.0B)Agilent offers a variety of consumables to go along with their instrument offerings, including reagents, chromatography columns, and sample prep kits.Diagnostics &amp;amp; Genomics GroupOligo Manufacturing (21%, $300M)Agilent produces oligonucleotide APIs for clinical and commercial purposes for over 30 Pharma and Biotech partners. The Train B expansion project is coming online now (adds ~$150M in annual rev.) and the company announced Train C&amp;amp;D expansions to come online in 2026/27 and add ~$450M in rev.Cancer Diagnostics (41%, $575M)This portfolio is largely a result of the Dako acquisition in 2012. Includes pathology, specific proteins and flow cytometry reagents, and companion diagnostics (~14% market share)(20% $1.4B)Genomics Solutions (38%, $525M)This includes target enrichment, cytogenic research solutions and microarrays, PCR and qPCR instruments and molecular biology reagents, and automated electrophoresis and microfluidics solutions.ServicesWhile the majority of Agilent&#x27;s service offerings are break-fix for their own instrument systems, ~10% of ACG is enterprise services where they manage the lab for customers and provide services for competitors products as well.Agilent CrossLab Group (21%, $1.5B)",
