JPM Nvidia take is HERE and our team note that revenue guidance was at the upper end of our expectations with Blackwell/Blackwell Ultra Rack volumes driving the upside. From a Capital Goods Point of view, therefore, we see little in the Nvidia print that undermines the positive growth outlook for Data Centre capex for our European coverage.",

The note is cross asset and incorporates work from our Healthcare team to look at what fundamental fair value is for SHL. We note that Siemens has, over the past decade, closed its conglomerate discount versus peers and this note asks whether it can now start to trade at a premium. With ongoing portfolio simplification likely to be announced at December's CMD (SHL) and the potential for the core 'New Siemens' to outgrow its peers we believe that this is possible. There's a huge amount of work in the note so let me know if you'd like to connect with Phil to go through it. NOTE IS HERE.",

He also notes that the stock is cheaper than it has been over the past couple of years despite growth forecasts being higher. We are encouraged by the breadth of growth opportunities across multiple end markets, as is also reflected in at least HSD% OSG seen across all the key divisions in 1H25. The key mantra remains to stretch the core by leveraging its enviable technological edge (9%+ R&D/sales) and its ability to customize offerings (which also drives higher differentiation and pricing power) to increase penetration of its existing and new products, while also exploring growth from potential new applications/markets. This also partly explains the higher than expected capex/sales guidance of LDD% for the next three years (vs. our previous estimate of \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) ) as the company is building a platform to be able to deliver faster growth (up to 9% CAGR) than seen in the past ( \\(\\sim 6\\%\\) OSG CAGR over the past 10 years) with an underlying post-tax ROIC of \\(>20\\%\\) . We cut our FY25-28E adj EPS by 4-5%, largely to reflect the incremental FX headwinds and as a result we also trim our Dec 2026 PT to DKK 512 (DKK 545). That said, with a potential 10%+ adj EPS CAGR over the next 3-5 years with high underlying ROIC, we see the recent derating - FY25/26/27E P/E of 28x/26x/24x vs. the historical long-term multiple of \\(\\sim 30x\\) - as an attractive entry point, with our DCF model suggesting an upside potential to DKK 590.

Current trading is largely unchanged from the Q2 print although the CEO noted that 'Germany is becoming more confident' - even if they do not expect to see project announcements on the back of the stimulus package until early 2026. The likely debate point from the event revolves around strategy - with the Company indicating it is pursuing acquisitions (could be up to CHF1bn) in light(ish) side materials. It wants to become a solutions provider to the construction industry with an offer of Roofing, Walling, Flooring and Foundational materials alongside the concrete it supplies. Commentary regarding the medium term consolidation of the European cement market was supportive - and, in the near term, the Company expects European pricing to move up in early 2026. We are awaiting the new carbon benchmark from the EU and the Company expects it to be Eur40 or higher which would prompt double digit price increases. Further support comes due to industry consumption of existing carbon credits. Note that these are spec sales views - not yet properly discussed with my research colleagues.",

      "text": "Global Autos Driver - Robotaxi Rides Weekly- Jose M Asumendi here Please find below the latest developments on autonomous driving across the world:Shanghai has introduced a driverless Robotaxi service that provides passengers with connections between Shanghai Disney Resort and Pudong International Airport. The service is operated by IM Motors, SAIC Motor's mobility service platform Xiangdao Chuxing, and SAIC AI Lab, as reported by the Shanghai Observer, citing IM Motors. Passengers can book rides from designated pick- up points through Xiangdao Chuxing's mobile app, with the journey from the resort to Pudong International Airport taking approximately 30 minutes. Since part of the route includes highways, a safety operator will be in the driver's seat. In emergencies, the Robotaxi can be switched to manual mode to allow the operator to take control. Honda Motor Co. has signed a multi- year agreement with US AI startup Helmi.ai Inc. to develop self- driving capabilities. The collaboration aims to produce advanced driver assistance systems for Honda's mass market vehicles by 2027. Mahito Shikama, head of Honda's software defined vehicle business, stated that the joint development supports Honda's goal of realizing safe and affordable automated driving technologies for global customers. Self- driving vehicle startup Nuro closed its latest funding round on Thursday, raising \\(203 million at a\\) 6 billion valuation from new investors Uber and Nvidia, alongside returning backers. The latest tranche of \\(97 million follows the\\) 106 million announced in April, which included investors such as T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Tiger Global. Nuro has partnered with EV maker Lucid and Uber to launch a global robotaxi service. Uber plans to deploy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's system across dozens of markets over six years starting in 2026. Kodiak Robotics, an autonomous vehicle technology maker, has integrated NXP Semiconductors' automotive processors and in- vehicle networking interfaces to enhance the performance and reliability of its autonomous trucking system. The partnership, announced Wednesday, incorporates NXP's automotive solutions into the Kodiak Actuation Control Engine (ACE). ACE is Kodiak's custom- built computer that manages vehicle actuation, or more simply, turning the electric or mechanical signals into motion. The integration supports Kodiak's AI- powered autonomous system, known as the Kodiak Driver, and enables the system to execute a safe fallback maneuver and bring the vehicle to a stop if either a safety- critical component or the Kodiak Driver fails. Waymo has started testing its new Robotaxi equipped with sixth- generation self- driving hardware. The new hardware features over 13 cameras, 6 radar systems, and 4 LiDAR sensors onboard according to media platform X, along with a video showcasing the autonomous vehicle in action. The video displays the vehicle driving on the road with a safety driver on board. Additionally, the new Waymo Robotaxi is equipped with heaters, wipers, and sprayers to maintain the cleanliness of the self- driving technology. RoboSense Technology and Hesai Technology, two leading Chinese manufacturers of light detection and ranging sensors, have reported a triple- digit surge in robot product sales last quarter. This segment is beginning to replace advanced driver assistance systems as the main growth driver for both companies. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating delays by Tesla Inc. in reporting details of crashes involving driver- assistance technology. According to NHTSA, the delays were \"due to an issue with Tesla's data collection, which, according to Tesla, has now been fixed.\" NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation has opened an audit query to assess the cause of the late reports and the mitigation efforts to prevent future occurrences.",
