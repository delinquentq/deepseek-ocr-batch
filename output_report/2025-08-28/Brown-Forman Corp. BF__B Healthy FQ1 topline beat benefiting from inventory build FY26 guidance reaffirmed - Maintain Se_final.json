      "text": "Our View - Expectations were low heaing into BF's FQ1 results, dragged largely by global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties - coupled with category trends which remain pressured. Although FQ1 results were better than feared, as organic net sales growth that was up \\(+1\\%\\) (ahead of our/Visible Alpha Consensus Data estimates of \\(- 3.8\\%\\) ), the stock was pressured today \\((- 5\\%)\\) - likely given concerns that: (1) FQ1 sales were inflated due to an inventory build ahead of the distributor transitions in 13 states (which took place August 1st), with shipment growth \\((+6\\%)\\) outpacing depletion growth \\((+3\\%)\\) ; (2) Underlying EBIT trends were under pressure, \\(\\sim - 8\\%\\) y/y in FQ1 - considering the estimated net change in distributor inventories had a \\(\\sim +10\\%\\) impact on EBIT growth, though organic EBIT was only \\(+2\\%\\) ; and (3) There continues to be concerns that the alcohol category headwinds could be more structural (vs cyclical) in nature. That said, BF's stronger FQ1 topline growth helped drive healthy gross margin expansion, though adj. EPS of \\(\\) 0.35\\((- - 11\\% y / y)\\) was broadly in- line with cons ests \\((\\) 0.36\\$ ), but slightly below our \\(\\) 0.38\\$ est. Looking ahead, mgmt maintained its FY26 guidance - which we think is prudent given it's still early in the year - with expectations for growth to be weighed by continued headwinds from global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties (per mgmt). With that, mgmt expects FY26 organic net sales and operating profit growth of - LSD% (below mgmt's l.t. +MSD target on the topline) - which taking into account the FQ1 results, implies - LSD topline/operating income growth declines throughout year- end. Along these lines, mgmt noted that they expect F1H topline results to be in- line with their FY26 guidance (- LSD%), which suggests that growth in FQ2 will be under some pressure - likely following the inventory build ahead of the distributor transitions and following the initial channel fill of Jack Daniel's Tennessee BlackBerry (which just recently hit shelves). That said, we think guidance this year should be broadly achievable - particularly given the stronger FQ1 results provide some flexibility to still deliver on guidance should category/consumer pressures become even more onerous in the back half of the year.",

      "text": "inflationary pressures continue to weigh on purchase decisions. Looking ahead, key themes remain: (1) Distributor inventory levels - US distributors continue to target the low end of their normal ranges, with depletion trends in FY26 expected to broadly mirror underlying trends in FY25 (i.e. - 2%) - with FY26 shipments & depletions expected to be in- line; (2) Tariff risk - Still lots of uncertainty around tariffs - with mgmt's FY26 guidance assuming the current tariff impact on BF's products will remain unchanged. However, mgmt noted that they remain optimistic based on recent developments related to tariffs under the USMCA - though Canada's organic sales decline by nearly 60% as American spirit products largely remain off the shelves in the majority of the Canadian provinces. Lastly, it's important to note that tariffs have had a direct impact on BF's P&L, as COGS inflation (and lower production levels) was a \\(\\sim 90\\) bps headwind to gross margins in FQ1; (3) Whiskey outlook - with Woodford Reserve being just one of three growing brands within the top 20 spirits brands (according to Nielsen, per mgmt) - though we recognize that Woodford Reserve OSG was down - 1% in FQ1 (vs +8% in FY25); (4) Pricing/Promotions - Mgmt previously highlighted today their desire for +LSD% pricing company- wide, despite distributor inventory levels which have broadly normalized and the implied FQ1 price/mix of \\(\\sim - 5\\%\\) (largely a negative mix impact from RTDs growing faster) - with mgmt further noting that pricing industry- wide remains broadly rational. However, given slowing consumption trends globally - we wouldn't be surprised to see the promotional intensity pick up in an effort to drive a reacceleration of volume growth; and (5) Cyclical vs potentially structural headwinds - with mgmt continuing to make their case for why challenges today are more cyclical (inflation- driven consumer pressures), not structural (GLP- 1, Gen- Z drinking habits, cannabis and increasing health & wellness trends), in nature. However, mgmt did note today that the eventual outcome in the cyclical vs structural debate is likely somewhere in the middle.",

      "text": "All in, we continue to remain cautious given ongoing pressures on consumption - which we think could ultimately prove to be a bit more structural in nature (i.e. the historical \\(\\sim + MSD\\%\\) industry growth rate will realistically be lower moving forward) - and we see increased risk for greater promotional activity. That said, longer term BF sees spirits continuing to take share from beer/wine (which has been going on for a long time, per mgmt) with additional benefits from premiumization. Given the slight FQ1 EPS miss (vs our sets) and mgmt's FY26 guidance - which continues to incorporate the impact from used barrel sales expected to be down by more than \\~half ( \\(\\sim\\) \\$87M last FY) - we lower our FY26/FY27 EPS sets by \\$0.04/\\$0.01 to \\$1.62/\\$1.71 (- 9.2%/+5.3% y/y). That said, we maintain our price target of \\$25. Bottom line - While we expect BF to benefit from l.t. premiumization trends and improved inventory levels, we remain concerned about visibility improving on category trends and long term growth rates moderating (i.e. possibly more structural vs cyclical), which will likely weigh on sentiment near term and therefore see a negative risk- reward. As such, we maintain our Sell rating.",

Herradura's net sales declines were driven by lower volumes in the US as the tequila category remains competitive, per mgmt. Finally, the Travel Retail channel reported net sales growth of \\(+8\\%\\) (organic \\(+7\\%\\) ), driven by higher volumes of Jack Daniel's Tequila. See Whiskey & Gin Mare (partially due to the timing of shipments), as well as a positive FX impact. Elsewhere, gross margins expanded \\(\\sim 40\\) bps y/y to \\(59.8\\%\\) (vs our/cons sets of \\(60.0 / 59.3\\%\\) ), driven by the positive impact from acquisitions & divestitures - albeit partially offset by higher costs, unfavorable price/mix, and the negative effect of FX.

In addition, American whiskey is continuing to gain share in a number of markets outside the US including Germany, the UK, and Poland, which provides BF with a long runway for growth. BF is also the only scaled, publicly traded company with sizable exposure to whiskey, which could make it an attractive acquisition candidate for a larger spirits company looking to increase exposure to the important American whiskey segment, though we see a low likelihood of any deal given BF's family ownership and control structure - as the Brown Family controls the majority of BF's class A voting shares.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
