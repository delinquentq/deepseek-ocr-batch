Some companies, such as Microsoft, have implemented price increases in Japan, mainly for services with low price elasticity, due to significant JPY depreciation, which has also contributed to the expansion of the digital deficit in JPY terms. However, with the reversal of JPY depreciation in 2025, the digital deficit has expanded more slowly in JPY terms. The digital deficit came to JPY3.4trn through end- June, similar to that in H1 24, and is likely to remain on a similar scale as last year for the year as a whole.",

The strengths of each economy in IT services are accumulated through years of know- how, investment, and innovation, making it difficult for other economies to catch up easily, so this divergence is likely to remain as a structural factor for current account improvement (or deterioration). In Japan's case, AI- related payments are expected to increase in the future, and Japan ranked 11th in the 2024 Global AI Ranking1, indicating that delays in the AI field are likely to continue expanding the digital deficit as a trend. Obviously, economies with substantial surpluses in net digital service exports, such as the US (1st), China (2nd), and the UK (4th), are ranked high in the AI rankings, while Switzerland, like Japan, has a low ranking of 12th among advanced economies.",

If the significant JPY depreciation seen in 2024 persists, there is a risk that the digital deficit could expand to JPY11trn by 2030. On the other hand, if JPY depreciation corrects, the pace of digital deficit expansion may slow somewhat. Of course, exchange rate fluctuations also affect other items in the current account (eg, travel receipts mentioned later), so the expansion of the JPY- denominated digital deficit due to JPY depreciation does not necessarily mean that the external balance will deteriorate.",

Since 2013, the trend of the JPY's FX supply and demand (excluding flows unaffected by FX such as reinvested income and FX- hedged investments) has been in a deficit trend due to outward securities and direct investments slightly exceeding the current account surplus centered around the income balance (Figure 5). Even after COVID, as outward investments exceeding the current account surplus continued, the impact of FX intervention (4q moving sum) slightly tilted the supply- demand towards JPY buying, but with the fading of past effects, it is now turning back to JPY selling. The main reason for the improvement in the income balance is JPY depreciation and the rise in overseas interest rates but it looks toppy now that the JPY depreciation trend has paused while the trade balance is near zero and the service balance continues to show a slight deficit (Figure 6).",
