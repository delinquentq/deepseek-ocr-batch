The company notes that it \"continued to trade well during the fourth quarter, supported by further conversion of larger solutions projects\".

This is up from its \"low teens\" guide given at the 3Q25 stage (which was a raise from low- double digit growth before that). We note that consensus is currently forecasting \\(4.3\\%\\) y/y gross profit and \\(13\\%\\) operating profit growth for FY25.
