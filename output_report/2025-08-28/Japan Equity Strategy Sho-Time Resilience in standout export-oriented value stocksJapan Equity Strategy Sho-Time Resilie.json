If dovish expectations for the Fed fade and US rates and USD/JPY rise, export- oriented value stocks are likely to gain relative strength: While the Jackson Hole meeting was initially seen as dovish, Powell later noted that a longer- run inflation rate of 2 percent as most consistent with Fed's dual- mandate goals, committing to this target is a key factor helping keep longer- term inflation expectations well anchored. If CPI stabilizes toward \\(2\\%\\) , rate cuts toward the neutral level may be justified. However, if inflation remains sticky or shows signs of reacceleration—such as from tariffs—dovish expectations may be reassessed. In that case, rising US rates and USD/JPY could further support export- oriented value stocks.",

As noted in Sho- Time: A New Game Begins, past cases suggest an LDP leadership election would likely follow within 2–3 weeks. Even if the current administration remains, the ruling coalition still lacks a majority in both houses, requiring cooperation with opposition parties on economic policy. Expansionary fiscal measures could benefit bank stocks via a steeper yield curve, though short- term correction risks remain, as bank stocks appear to have overshot market- implied BOJ rate expectations.",
