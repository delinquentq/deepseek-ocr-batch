      "text": "Aug-2025Jul-2025The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. With inflation remaining stable, economic growth, while there is still high uncertainty surrounding the economic growth outlook, has shown modest improvement, mainly driven by domestic demand, and movements in housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas and in household debt need to be further monitored. The Board, therefore, judged that it is appropriate to maintain the current level of the Base Rate and to assess any changes in domestic and external conditions.The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Economic growth is forecast to remain low for some time and there is high uncertainty related to trade negotiations, while the inflation rate remains broadly stable. However, as it is also necessary to assess the impact of the recently strengthened measures for household debt management and given the significant acceleration in housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas and household debt, the Board judged that it is appropriate to maintain the current level of the Base Rate.Global economyCurrently available information suggests that, despite progress made on trade negotiations between the U.S. and major economies, the global economy is expected to gradually slow in growth and experience a divergence in inflation trajectories across countries, as the impact of tariff increases starts to materialize. In global financial markets, long-term U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar index rose, and then fell due to the heightened expectation of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Stock prices in major economies have risen as uncertainty regarding tariff negotiations eased. Looking ahead, the global economy and financial markets will be influenced by developments in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, by the prospects for product-specific tariffs, and by changes in monetary policies in major economies.Korean economyIn terms of the domestic economy, despite continued sluggishness in construction investment, growth has improved due to a recovery in consumption and due to a better than expected increase in exports, mainly driven by semiconductors. The increase in the overall number of employed persons has continued, but some major industries, such as manufacturing, have continued to decline. Going forward, domestic demand is expected to sustain a modest recovery, affected by the implementation of a supplementary budget and by an improvement in consumer sentiment. Exports are likely to show favorable movements for some time, but are likely to gradually slow as the impacts of U.S. tariffs expand. Consequently, the growth rate is forecast at 0.9% for this year, slightly above the May forecast of 0.8%. The growth rate for next year is expected to be consistent with the previous forecast of 1.6%. High uncertainty remains along the future path of economic growth concerning trade negotiations between the U.S. and China and concerning the imposition of product-specific tariffs, as well as the pace of recovery in domestic demand.InflationInflation has remained stable, with consumer price inflation falling slightly to 2.1% in July, while core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) held steady at 2.0%. Short-term inflation expectations among the general public have increased slightly to 2.6% in August from 2.5% in the previous month. Looking ahead, despite rising agricultural, livestock, and fishery prices, inflation is projected to remain at around 2% due to subdued demand-side pressure and due to the stabilization of global oil prices. As a result, consumer price inflation is forecast to be 2.0% for this year, slightly above the May forecast of 1.9%, and core inflation is expected to be consistent with the previous forecast of 1.9%. Next year, consumer price inflation and core inflation are both forecast to be 1.9%, slightly above the previous forecast of 1.8% due to the continuing recovery in consumption. The future path of inflation is likely to be affected by economic conditions at home and abroad, by movements in exchange rates and in global oil prices, and by the government&#x27;s price stabilization measures.Financial StabilityFinancial and foreign exchange markets have generally remained stable. Long-term Korean Treasury bond yields have fluctuated within a narrow range. The upward trend of stock prices has somewhat weakened due to corrective pressure from the increases so far and due to changes in expectations concerning regulatory reforms in the capital market. The Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate rose due to expectations that residents&#x27; demand for overseas investment funds would continue. The increase in household loans has significantly lessened, affected by the government&#x27;s household debt measures. In Seoul and its surrounding areas, housing price increases and transaction volumes have decelerated, but the expectations for rising housing prices remain high.Monetary Policy OutlookThe Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over the medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth while paying attention to financial stability. The domestic economy has shown some improvement in growth, but uncertainties surrounding the future path of economic growth remain high due to U.S. tariff policies, while inflation remains on a stable trajectory. Regarding financial stability, it is necessary to further assess whether it will remain on a sustained path of stability while housing price appreciation in Seoul and its surrounding areas and household debt growth have moderated, and to remain cautious about the possibility of increased exchange rate volatility. Therefore, the Board will maintain its rate cut stance to mitigate downside risks to economic growth and adjust the timing and pace of any further Base Rate cuts while closely monitoring changes in domestic and external policy conditions and examining the resulting impact on inflation and financial stability.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
