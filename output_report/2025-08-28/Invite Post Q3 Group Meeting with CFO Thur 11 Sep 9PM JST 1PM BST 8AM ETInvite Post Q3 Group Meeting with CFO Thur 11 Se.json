      "text": "Timee, Inc. operates a matching service for short term spot work for venues such as restaurants or distribution centers. The company is headed by a young CEO called Mr Ryo Ogawa who started this service while at University. This matching service has grown to be the number one spot work company in Japan. The benefit of spot work is flexibility when companies are struggling for workers. The clients are mainly restaurants or logistics or distribution centers. The benefits for restaurants are that it can fill a vacancy in a short period of time. As a market leader, Timee has workers review data after the shift. This is important as the workers do not require interviews or resume submission to get spot work. Therefore, the first few shifts are essentially interviews which makes the follow- up job offers likely or less likely. The right level of matching is essential. For example if there are too many registered workers to the number of premises, there will not be enough jobs where the registered workers get annoyed. Equally, if there are too many premises compared to registered workers, the premises run the risk of being understaffed. This can be the difference between not having a dishwasher available for a restaurant and the manager having to work this spot, which probably affects the day take for restaurants.",
