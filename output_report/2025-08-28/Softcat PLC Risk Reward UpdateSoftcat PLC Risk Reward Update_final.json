Continued conversion of larger deals drove further upside to FY25 growth estimates, with the company now expecting high teens growth in gross profit and mid teens growth in operating profit, up from low teens previously. We align our forecasts to this updated guidance and now look for \\(18\\%\\) gross profit growth and \\(15\\%\\) operating profit growth in FY25. This drives FY25 EPS c. \\(2\\%\\) higher. We also align our FY26 forecasts to Softcat's new guidance (high single / low single- digit growth in gross profit / operating profit) which results in a c. \\(3\\%\\) cut to our FY26 operating profit and EPS forecasts. We assume a return to low double / high single- digit gross profit / operating profit growth from FY27. Altogether, these changes result in our FY27 EPS being cut by \\(5\\%\\) . We roll forward our DCF 1 year (striking valuation from end of FY26), which offsets the underlying cut and results in a \\(2\\%\\) increase to our PT to 1620p.",
