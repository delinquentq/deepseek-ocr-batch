      "text": "BSP cuts by 25bp as widely expected; tone has become less dovish - The BSP reduced the policy rate by 25bp, from \\(5.25\\%\\) to \\(5.0\\%\\) during the Monetary Board (MB) meeting today, in line with JPM and consensus expectations. Interest rates for overnight deposit and lending facilities were also lowered to \\(4.50\\%\\) and \\(5.50\\%\\) accordingly. The central bank left its inflation forecasts over the policy horizon largely unchanged (2025: \\(1.7\\%\\) ; 2026: \\(3.3\\%\\) ; 2027: \\(3.4\\%\\) ), while highlighting some upside risks from possible electricity tariff adjustments and higher rice tariffs. Compared to the previous MB meeting in June, the tone on growth is marginally more constructive. The statement mentioned that domestic demand has \"held firm\", likely in response to the decent 2Q25 GDP print, although US policies are still expected eventually to weigh on global and domestic growth. The phrase \"the need for a more accommodative monetary policy stance\" was removed as well, replaced by a neutral statement that future monetary policy responses will be based on the \"evolving outlook for inflation and growth\".",

      "text": "Inflation trajectory hinges on impact of temporary rice imports suspension - To the extent that inflation remains the marginal driver of future policy rate decisions, the impact of the upcoming two- month rice imports suspension effective September 1 on overall inflation is pivotal. As mentioned in the July CPI note (see link), we think that the inflationary impact of this policy is likely not significant. Setting aside the temporary nature of the import suspension, domestic rice stocks (Figure 1) are ample to meet demand. Based on FAO's projections (Figure 2), we estimate that the shortfall caused by a two- month import suspension is around 690k metric tons. \\(65\\%\\) of that shortfall can be covered by the National Food Authority (NFA)'s inventories (450k), while the other \\(35\\%\\) can be met by private sector inventories, with the enforcement of the Anti- Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act (signed into law in September 2024) working to stamp out hoarding/profiteering behaviour. In the worst- case scenario, if rice prices go up by the same magnitude as the last two months ( \\(2.5\\%\\) /m) during the suspension period, we estimate that headline CPI would rise from \\(1.6\\%\\) / \\(2.3\\%\\) to \\(2.5\\%\\) / \\(2.9\\%\\) / \\(2.9\\%\\) / \\(2.9\\%\\) / \\(2.9\\%\\) in the Sept 25- Aug 26 period and in 2026, respectively.",

As such, we think that there is still policy space for further easing and maintain our terminal rate estimate of \\(4.5\\%\\) . However, we have decided to push out the next two rate cuts from October/December 2025 to December 2025/February 2026, considering the BSP's cautious tone on near- term rice inflation and the growing view that tariff- related growth headwinds could be delayed.",
