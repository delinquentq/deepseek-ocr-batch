      "text": "NetApp delivered to its own forecasts relative to both revenue and margins in F1Q, but given typical management conservatism early in the year, the company reiterated its full- year guidance. While within the earnings results investors might be concerned about the modest gross margin miss to consensus expectations, the product- mix led deviation from the midpoint of the guide is only modest (71.1% vs. guidance of 71%- 72% and consensus of 71.5%), and additionally not material enough to lead the management team to change its expectations for the full year (FY26); although the reiterated gross margin guide for the full year is likely helped by better outlook for Public Cloud gross margins where the company is raising its long- term gross margin expectations from 75%- 80% prior to 80%- 85%. On the flip- side, missed by investors within an earnings print that otherwise looked in- line at the surface was management's acknowledgment that the performance in the quarter in relation to revenue was better than expected by the company for F1Q, including revenues tracking modestly higher than midpoint of the guide for the quarter ( \\(1.56 bn vs. guidance of\\) 1.53 bn). Additionally, management highlighted higher confidence in its 2H FY26 guide relative to 90 days ago, hinting at higher visibility through its pipeline, leading us to expect potential raises to the full- year revenue guide in the coming quarters if performance continues to track above company guidance. The primary investor concern relative to FY26 remains relative to the implied acceleration from low- single digit growth y/y in revenues in F1H26 to mid- single digit growth in F2H26, but we believe 2H expectations are still broadly in line with typical seasonality with potential for upside from conversion of large datacenter modernization projects that the company is engaged with multiple customers on; additionally, the implied acceleration in y/y growth in 2HFY26 relative to 1HFY26 is largely explained by easier comps as well as lower headwinds on a y/y basis from Spot divestiture in 2H Y26. Moving away from the financials, following earnings reports from Storage companies today, we believe the demand backdrop for Storage remains resilient with potential easing of cautious spending from Enterprise customers evidenced in the first half of the calendar year, except for demand within the Public Sector, which remains challenged. We expect the growth outlook for NetApp to remain healthy in FY26 and the company is positioned to deliver upsides through the datacenter modernization projects prioritized by Enterprises as well as AI- related projects with Enterprise customers which are just starting to ramp. Reiterate Overweight on the combination of potential revenue upsides as well as robust margins that are underappreciated in the inexpensive valuation multiple (NTAP shares are trading at 13x NTM P/E vs. long- term historical multiple of 14x).",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
