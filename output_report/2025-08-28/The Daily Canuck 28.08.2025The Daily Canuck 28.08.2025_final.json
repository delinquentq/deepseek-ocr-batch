      "text": "With RY and NA reporting Q3 earnings that can be categorized as a hit and a miss, valuations diverged in yesterday's trading. Below are our key thoughts coming out of the quarter: For National, disappointing top- line growth, led by trading, resulted in the first miss of the quarter. While NA will likely lead the group with its regulatory capital ratio as concerns ease about the potential economic downside, this is no longer the benefit it was previously, on top of a relatively disappointing announced repurchase plan. That said, we do expect a recovery to profitability over the medium term, with a likely commensurate lift in its valuation. For our full report, see \"NA 3Q25 Earnings Review: More Than One Step Back\". For Royal, while a fair number of dominoes fell in the bank's favour in the quarter, it is hard to argue against the earnings diversity and strength that can produce a better than \\(17\\%\\) ROE (on a better than \\(13\\%\\) regulatory capital ratio). While it would be foolhardy to assume that Q3 represents a new run- rate in earnings, we fully anticipate that the top line and efficiency surprises will support a lift to consensus numbers and entrench RY's premium multiple against its peers. For our full report, see \"RY 3Q25 Earnings Review: Asserting Why It Deserves Its Premium Valuation\". Last night, EQB reported Q3 results that missed expectations for the second consecutive quarter, as personal lending credit weakened and NIMs compressed. We expect the company eventually to be able to navigate through this difficult patch, but the significant management transition following the unexpected passing of its former CEO leads us to suspect that the market may take a 'wait and see' approach towards EQB's valuation before pricing in a potentially premature recovery in profitability. For more on our initial take, see \"EQB 3Q25 First Look: (Negative) Personal Lending Provisions Take Their Bite\". As for the remaining banks, today, CM and TD are due out this morning, while LB closes out the week tomorrow. On the macro front, later this morning, Statistics Canada will release average weekly earnings (Y/Y) and current account (Q2) data. That said, the headline focus remains tomorrow's June and Q2 GDP numbers Jefferies Global Bank Valuation Comps - 26/08/2025 Jefferies Global Brokers, AMs & Exchanges Valuation Comps - 30/06/2025",

StatsCan's Survey of Business Conditions for the third quarter of 2025, released on Wednesday, found that \\(39.4\\%\\) of businesses were either very likely or somewhat likely to pass cost increases due to U.S. tariffs onto their customers over the next 12 months. That's compared with \\(15.4\\%\\) of Canadian businesses who were very unlikely or somewhat unlikely to do the same, while \\(27.2\\%\\) of businesses did not expect any cost increases due to tariffs over the next 12 months. Although costs are expected to increase for many Canadian businesses in the coming months, \"the proportion of businesses with a positive outlook has remained comparable with previous quarters,\" StatCan said in its release. The survey found that \\(53\\%\\) of businesses expect to be able to operate for the next year or longer if the tariffs and counter tariffs imposed by the U.S. and Canada remain at current levels. That's compared to \\(5.8\\%\\) of businesses who anticipate being unable to continue operating in the current environment beyond the next 12 months, and \\(41.3\\%\\) of businesses who said they are unsure how long they'll be able to continue operating if tariff pressures do not ease. \"Furthermore, \\(51.6\\%\\) of businesses across Canada anticipate being able to maintain their current level of staffing over the next 12 months or longer if the tariffs imposed by the U.S. and Canada remain at their current levels,\" StatCan said.",

An advance tally of manufacturing sales points to a solid \\(1.8\\%\\) improvement in trade in July from a month prior, while wholesale sales are estimated to have risen \\(1.3\\%\\) for the month, data released from Statistics Canada showed. The advance in factory sales was led by improved trade in transportation equipment, as well as in petroleum and coal, the data agency said. The improvement for the wholesale industry reflected higher sales by the motor vehicle and parts and accessories industry. The article notes that trade- exposed sectors of Canada's economy have faced the brunt of the fallout from the abrupt shift in the U.S. approach to trade and frequently changing import tariffs, though there have been some signs of stability returning and recent polls indicate business and household confidence is improving from record lows in the spring",

The article notes that data from Statistics Canada underscores the rise in costs, as grocery prices climbed over \\(27\\%\\) between July 2020 to July 2025. And, while rent and housing costs may have slowed down in recent months, asking rents remain elevated from 2019 levels, up \\(71\\%\\) in Montreal, up \\(27\\%\\) in Vancouver, and up a more modest \\(5\\%\\) in Toronto. Harris & Partners states that \"we are seeing a pattern where rising prices are outpacing income growth and people are being forced to make increasingly difficult choices. It is not about cutting back on luxuries anymore; it is about whether you can cover rent, keep the lights on and put food on the table.\" And, those hoping for relief in the form of a pay raise may need to wait, as a recent report by Mercer LLC said annual compensation budgets, the budget allocated for salaries, are expected to continue their downward trend into 2026.",

RY did benefit from lower provisions, as we have seen consistently this quarter with its peers, but, from our perspective, what was more impressive was the top line growth and the bank's ability to leverage that into a solid performance on efficiency.
