We believe even some of CEE's lower growth business units increased expenditure. (2) Competition: competition intensified as new competitors entered the vocational education industry to enjoy government subsidies. CEE management, upon noticing the issues in 2022, started to proactively tackle them. Management focuses more on the ROIC on marketing expenditures. By 2024, most of the low- ROIC campaigns had ended and were replaced by higher- ROIC marketing. We witnessed a meaningful recovery in CEE's margins.
