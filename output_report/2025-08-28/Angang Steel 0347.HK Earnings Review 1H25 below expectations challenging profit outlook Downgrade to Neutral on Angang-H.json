While ongoing disciplined steel production, albeit not consistent, is leading to mild recovery in unit steel profit in the industry, we expect recurring net profit to remain challenged for Angang with net loss in 2025E. Accordingly, we downgrade Angang- H to Neutral from Buy with a target price unchanged at HK\\$2.40. Since adding Angang- H to our Buy list on Mar 31, 2025, the share price has risen by 24% vs. HSI up 5.9%. Maintain Neutral on Angang- A with 12m target price of Rmb2.60 (unchanged).",

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
