Our revenue estimates contemplate 2Q hardware revenue remaining fairly flat with 1Q, despite it being a historically stronger quarter due to seasonality, taking into account the mixed impacts of potential pre- buying in the first half of this year ahead of anticipated tax credit phase- outs or tariffs, which could result in incremental deliveries landing in 2Q, or, customers doubling down on pausing new orders due to a worse EV sales and market penetration outlook in the years to come. While we expect to eventually see revenue uplift from ChargePoint's channel partnership with Eaton, this is set to be more impactful from F3Q onward once the partnership is operationalized and new offerings are announced in the coming weeks. We expect gross margins to improve slightly on a sequential basis, though largely still weighted to the 2H of the year as existing inventory is sold through before we see the benefit of ChargePoint's new, lower- cost hardware roll through. Although management has remained committed to turning EBITDA breakeven exiting this year, this will largely depend on meaningful H/H revenue and margin growth; based on our calculations, ChargePoint would need to reach \\(\\sim\\) 140M+ of revenue, \\(20\\% +\\) hardware gross margins, and maintain relatively flat opex to achieve this on a run- rate basis in F4Q, which still feels highly ambitious to us. We think investors would be disappointed, but not surprised, if profitability guidance were to be withdrawn or postponed. We tweak our out- year estimates and remain below the Street throughout the course of our modeling period as we think the hardware- software EV charging providers will continue to face competitive pressures from commoditization, which could be worse for revenue growth and margin trajectory. We remain Underweight rated CHPT and establish a \\(\\) 9\\(Dec 2026 price target after updating our estimates and accounting for the recent 1 - for - 20 reverse stock split.",
