Comp delivery of \\(+5\\%\\) accelerated meaningfully vs. 1Q at - flat (despite tougher compares) and came in well ahead of FactSet consensus at \\(+1.5\\%\\) . BURL noted weather-driven pressure in May gave way to stronger trends in June/July, with management calling out solid back- to- school (August MTD) performance. Performance is strong across consumer cohorts, with slight outperformance vs. the chain at stores in lower income trade areas as well as high Hispanic consumer trade areas (excluding Puerto Rico and Southern border states). BURL also discussed capitalizing on strong buying opportunities which drove reserves up Y/Y to \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) of total inventories, where management noted they were pleased with the quality / composition and are well- positioned to chase into demand into 3Q. The company was also able to navigate tariffs well in the quarter, where management discussed its mitigation strategies focused on vendor negotiations, mix shifting the assortment, selective pricing increases, driving faster inventory turns and lower markdowns, and various cost saving initiatives. Net, the company's guidance assumes BURL will be able to mitigate most of the incremental pressure from tariff rate changes since its prior FY25 guidance.",
