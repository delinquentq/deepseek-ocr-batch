The positive surprise on the full year outlook aligns with our forecasts and reflects higher than planned surgeon adds in 2Q and the flow through effect to forward revenue performance. In this context, we think it is important to consider the impact of key business drivers with both new surgeons and ramp of experienced surgeons serving as major inputs to the model. Given favorable reimbursement economics, we expect pricing to remain stable for 2025, although we do forecast industry standard LSD% declines starting in 2026, which given the differentiation of the Aprevo technology, could end up being a conservative assumption. As for new product launches, we continue to project cervical volumes contributing in 2026 with a more meaningful step- up in 2027+. From a financial and operational perspective, all metrics are tracking in- line with our view that the company's recent capital raise represents sufficient resources to turn adjusted EBITDA and cash flow positive without additional financing needs. Putting this all together, we maintain our Buy rating and \\(\\) 19\\$ price target (39% upside potential) and view current valuation (4.3x GSe 2026E sales) as offering compelling risk/reward.",
