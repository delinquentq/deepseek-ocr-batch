Back to Song Lyrics this week, and your lyric is \"I wouldn't, if I were you / I know what she can do / She's deadly, man, she could really rip your world apart\".

We believe today's and last week's EIA print corroborate strong weather-aided demand with estimated gas power burn above 49 Bcf/day for the reference week and the week ending August 15.

Daily gas power burn appears to be on track to fall nearly 5 Bcf/day week-over-week, and this decline is the main driver of that substantially higher injection rate (Figure 1). We also note that EIA 930 data point to lower week-over-week coal-fired power generation more in line with levels last seen in May and June (Figure 2). Pipeline data suggest that production is up week-over-week, and we have built in a 0.6 Bcf/day week-over-week increase versus the reference week. The Pacific region storage sample is showing a higher week-over-week withdrawal compared to the reference week. EIA 930 data for CAISO through yesterday show a 1 Bcf/day increase week-over-week in power burn for the region. Beyond the forecast injection for the week in progress, decidedly more shoulder season injections are on the horizon as cooling load dissipates both seasonally and on current weather forecasts",
