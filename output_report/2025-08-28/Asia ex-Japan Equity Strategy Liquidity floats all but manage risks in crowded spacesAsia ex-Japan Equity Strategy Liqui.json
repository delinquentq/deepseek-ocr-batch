While this would normally be considered a significant headwind, the global policy easing and China liquidity surge currently underway is providing a strong counter force. In this context, we believe the equity bull market will remain intact and any correction/ consolidation will present a buying opportunity. However, it is important to manage risks where positioning is particularly crowded. Looking across LO, HF and Quant investors, we note the highest crowding in Taiwan Tech/Semis and Indo Financials, followed by China Growth stocks (semis, consumer and biotech). Alongside this, ongoing support from monetary policy should eventually warrant a widening of the leadership and outperformance of Cyclicals. We are upgrading the Materials sector to Ow in the AxJ region following our recent allocation changes in India (see report). Within the AxJ region, our pecking order is Korea > India > China > Taiwan > ASEAN. Our key OwS are: China Tech, Internet, Healthcare, Materials, select Financial/Industrials; India Financials, Consumer ex Auto, Materials, Real Estate, Hospitals, select power/defense; Korea Financials, Tech, Holdco; TSMC in Taiwan; and ASEAN Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Healthcare, IT.",

For HFs, net positioning is currently most elevated in Cap Goods, Tech (Hardware and Semis) and Financial Services (Figure 11). For AI and Semis overall, JPM Prime book data show record high net positioning in both Mag 7 stocks and in US Semiconductors sector (Figure 12-13). From a factor lens, Growth is starting to look crowded in China after the recent strong performance (Figure 16). Crowding in Momentum in Korea is starting to unwind, but still elevated. Quality/Growth looks extremely crowded in Taiwan. Across all of North Asia, Defensives and Value look extremely uncrowded. No factor looks particularly crowded or uncrowded in India.",

(2) Taiwan: With EM/Asia investors starting to hit mandate constraints on TSMC again, we note that global funds, global TMT funds, hedge funds and sovereign investors are likely all unconstrained in terms of room to buy. For the largest of these cohorts, global funds have so far only neutralized previous UWs in the stock.

This is because the launch of the Nextrade (NXT) trading venue in Korea in March has had a substantial impact on market structure.
