Performance YTD (- 27%) has been driven primarily by compressing multiples (Exhibit 5), in our view, linked to a growth slowdown in FY25 with Biscoff capacity constraints. We believe 1H26 should be the turning point for growth momentum (Exhibit 1) with a sequential pick- up after the Biscoff Thailand plant starts production (which we expect will boost supply by +16%) while brand equity continues to improve (Exhibit 12). Additionally, partnerships with Mondelez (Europe Chocolate, India Biscuits) and Froneri (Europe Ice Cream then global roll out) will kick- in fully in 2026. Meanwhile, Natural Food International (Nakd, Trek, BEAR) continues its global expansion underpinned by the strong >30% OG in 1H25.",

We expect margins to increase to ca. 18% by FY28E (Exhibit 3; well ahead of cons. at 16.4%), supported by COGS deflation and operating leverage (+150bps), the Thailand factory opening (benefitting labour and transportation costs), local spread production in FY26 and partnerships (accretive phaseout of Ice Cream and Chocolate). However, we see a partial offset higher A&P and D&A spend (from capex plans) to fuel growth. This, combined with ca. 10% OG, will underpin a solid 13.6% EPS CAGR FY25- 28E (vs European Staples at ca. 8%).",

The recent derating (FY26 33x P/E; 5% discount to Lindt & Sprungli) provides an attractive entry point ahead of a clear 2026 acceleration. Additionally, limited exposure to cocoa (ca. 5% of COGS) allows Lotus to benefit from consumer trading out of chocolate confectionery to other snacking categories without cannibalization, especially in the US. We notch down EPS by - 1% pa for FY25- 26E, as we incorporate latest actuals, update for FX, and adjust margin forecasts- We are O/6/9% above consensus on FY25- 28 EPS.",

In our view, the minimum volume targeted by Lotus should be equivalent to current sales, i.e. 1.9bn units, or a 16% supply increase for Biscoff in FY26. Additionally, the capex program in FY25-26 to make the three key factories self-sufficient in spread production should push Biscoff volume capabilities across all 3 regions. Another way to think about it, is that, in our understanding, the Chonburi factory should start with four production lines (compared to five in the US and ca. 20 in Belgium). Considering that with five production lines, the US sells the equivalent of 2.4bn cookies, the rough assumption that each line should be able to produce 400-500m cookies looks reasonable and confirms our view that Thailand could boost production by 16% in 2026-27.",

We therefore consider Lotus a defensive stock, set to benefit from snacking and confectionery trends and improving margins. Beyond COGS stabilization, we believe co- manufacturing costs should come down, especially as Biscoff ice cream and chocolate are phased out in the next 12 months (ca. EUR30mn of sales) and replaced by ingredient sales to Froneri and Mondelez, which will generate better margins.
