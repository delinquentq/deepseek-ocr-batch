      "text": "Further out, ASM International is holding a CMD on 23 September. ASM guided 2027 at €4- 5bn at its last CMD. Since then, FX has devalued materially whilst the customer landscape has also shifted meaningfully. Updating for FX would suggest a new range along the lines of €3.5- 4.5bn. However, ASMI was assuming a WFE market of \\(120bn o/w\\) \\(\\) 50b\\(was related to GAA. We currently expect WFE to be flatish in 2026 but see reasons for 2027 to be a growth year (\\) 8\\%), potentially growing towards\\) 110bn. We estimate the main delta to ASM's previous expectations though is in the NAND market where ASMI has limited exposure. Thus a cut for a weaker WFE outlook could have limited impact on ASM. Given how many things can change between now and 2027, ASM may choose to only update for FX, in our view. We estimate the mix of revenues for ASM in 2025 to be roughly 40% leading edge, 20% lagging edge, \\(< 20\\%\\) memory and 20% spares/services but this has fluctuated drastically between 2022- 2025. At the last CMD, ASM helpfully provided a SAM of \\(\\) 400m\\(for the move from FinFET to GAA. In Outpacing the rest (3 June 2025), we estimated that ASM has captured 60%. We also estimated that a SAM for A14 vs N2 could be\\) \\ \\(400m\\) again (including backside power) - highlighting the continued growth from ALD and epitaxy. We also expect ASM to flag opportunities around molybdenum (although tangible wins are needed to reassure on growth here given competition), CFET (GAA stacked which could increase the SAM materially again), DRAM moving to 4f2 (we estimate could double ASM's DRAM TAM). We hope for some colour on 2026 but expect ASM to focus on these long- term drivers. (ASM International N.V.: Thoughts ahead of CMD, 21 August 2025)",
