Regional performance was varied: the Nordic region and Western Europe saw positive growth, while Eastern Europe & CIS declined, and North America was impacted by currency effects despite organic improvement in the US.The Middle East, Asia, Australia, and Africa rebounded strongly, with organic growth of 14.3% as supply disruptions in India were resolved. Gross margin improved to 36.4% due to restructuring and favorable product mix, but operating profit was affected by one-off costs related to a capital loss (SEK 5.7m) and CEO transition (SEK 14.6m). Despite ongoing market uncertainty, management remains optimistic about long-term growth, supported by a diversified footprint,strong balance sheet, and continued investment in energy-efficient solutions.",
