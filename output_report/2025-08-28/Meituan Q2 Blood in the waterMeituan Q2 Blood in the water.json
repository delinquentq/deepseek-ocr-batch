RMB10-12bn in incremental spend in Q2. Meituan management made multiple references to \"irrational\" competition, but the evidence from this quarter arguably adds to peers' resolve to keep upping the ante. A repeat of the July 5 debacle is probably unlikely, when the platforms tried very publicly to run up order volume records. But we doubt government regulators mind that a trio of large Internet platforms are subsidising consumers on its behalf. Alibaba has already guided to higher spend in Q3; we'd guess they sound more on the front foot when reporting on Friday.",

Note also that Meituan's user incentives recorded contra revenue are typically double of that booked in marketing spend... suggesting the total quarter on quarter increase in marketing spend was closer to RMB15bn. The fact Meituan lost just as much as JD in Q2 asks awkward questions on the value of its customer loyalty, and the company's ability to outlast the competition. Sequential increases in rider costs were explained as necessary spend to maintain order network density and delivery times... and felt indicative of the network effects in Meituan's food delivery business working in reverse, in the face of competitive pressure.",

On the analyst call, Meituan management tried to project a sense of business as usual, and keep the focus on in- house developments, things the company is building. Speaking around the quarter though they did also acknowledge that competitive intensity in food delivery will remain high in the next \"few quarters\". For what it's worth, August was said to have brought a slight moderation in competitive intensity versus July, but the company declined to make comparisons with June, when Alibaba entering the competitive fray led to Meituan's food delivery unit profit turning negative. The fact Meituan is expanding membership benefits in its IHT business as a way to fight back competitively probably means margins here will remain structurally lower too.",
