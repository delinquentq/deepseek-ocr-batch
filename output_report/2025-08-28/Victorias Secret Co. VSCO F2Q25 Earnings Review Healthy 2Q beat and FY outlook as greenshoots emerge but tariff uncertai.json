In the quarter, comps improved sequentially to \\(+4.0\\%\\) Y/Y from \\(- 1.0\\%\\) in 1Q, driven by improvements in both North America stores and digital while international retail comps remained consistent at \\(\\sim \\mathsf{HSD}\\%\\) . Importantly, comp growth accelerated in July and this momentum has sustained into August MTD. Management spoke to a meaningful inflection in core intimates as a result of strengthening consumer engagement with recent bra launches, supported by stronger marketing and new customer acquisition. Panties growth also inflected to \\(+MSD\\%\\) from - LSD% in 1Q. Beauty and PINK apparel commentary was also constructive. Margins outperformed expectations, driven by lower discounts ( \\(\\sim 70\\) bps), B&O leverage and stronger full price mix, partially offset by gift- with- purchase events ( \\(\\sim 30\\) bps), tariff and freight headwinds ( \\(\\sim 80\\) bps), incremental marketing investments and higher incentives. Net, the company raised its FY sales guidance and maintained its adjusted EPS forecast despite incorporating \\(\\sim\\) 50mn of incremental tariff headwinds.",

In particular, core intimates inflected materially in 2Q. Investments behind recent product launches, marketing, and customer experience are driving healthy new customacquisition, particularly with younger consumers. This suggests that the company's Path to Potential strategy is beginning to take root. That said, we note tariff uncertainty remains a key overhang on the stock and the company is set to navigate tougher compares into 2H25 and 2026.",
