      "text": "Our Take: PZU's Q2 net profit reached PLN 1.47bn, marking a 23% YoY increase and surpassing the company- compiled consensus by 3%. This positive result was primarily driven by a 32% increase in insurance operations, which constitute 64% of the group's earnings. The banking operations, including Pekao and Alior, which account for 36% of the group's earnings, had a 10% rise in earnings. Within insurance activities, insurance service result (underwriting result) saw a 11% increase, with the Poland non- life insurance combined ratio improving from 95% in Q2 2024 to 93% currently. Meanwhile, Poland life insurance maintained a strong profit margin of 26%, unchanged YoY, and had positive growth of 2% in the contractual service margin (CSM). Results from investment activities allocated to the insurance segment rose by 24%, further bolstering earnings. Overall, we view these results positively for PZU, although we maintain a Neutral rating on the stock, as we find limited upside potential for the shares at this time. We believe investor focus will remain on the execution of the proposed merger with Pekao, and we look forward to the earnings call at 13:00 CET for more details.",
