Last Q management remarked on a step change in demand from Cloud Providers - not just in terms of applications but also in terms of the number of cloud provider customers. Continued telco recovery along with MOFN ops also contributed to the beat last Q, and Routing & Switching strength expected in 2H as 1H order volume converts into revenue. We continue to look for more details around how CIEN is planning to play in the datacenter with its interconnect portfolio. Additionally, we look for updates on the pluggables business, and if there's upside to current FY forecast given (for revenue to at least double this FY vs FY24).",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
