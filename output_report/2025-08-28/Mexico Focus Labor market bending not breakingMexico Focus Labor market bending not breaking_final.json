The markers were that despite a steady unemployment rate, participation and employment were falling, and wage growth was slowing considerably. The March data, however, seem to have marked a low point and since then most indicators signal improvement. Employment is growing again and the participation rate has recovered. Other complementary indicators also underpin this sense of a turnaround in the labor market.",
