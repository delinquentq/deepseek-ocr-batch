While we were previously cautious about the demand outlook for loaders in China due the normalization of the user preference (from preferring loaders to excavators during 2008- 11 to excavators over loaders since 2016) that has led to a significant underperformance of loaders vs. excavators, we believe the trend of \"excavators substituting loaders\" in China seems to have largely come to an end, as evidenced by a normalized excavators/loaders ratio compared to the global ex- China level and the fact that loader demand has started to grow largely in tandem with excavators in this cycle. While Lonking's exports and margins positively surprised the market, we see a more balanced risk- reward after the ytd rally fueled by the near- term earnings upgrades and broad- based H- share rating. We are Neutral rated on the stock.",
