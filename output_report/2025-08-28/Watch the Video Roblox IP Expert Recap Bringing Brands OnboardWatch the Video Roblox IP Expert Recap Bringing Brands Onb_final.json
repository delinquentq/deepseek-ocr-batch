Brand budgets have grown from innovation spend to traditional marketing budgets, often part of broader campaigns as brands see spending on RBLX similar to social channels. Replay Here.",

Much of the IP related content on RBLX is unofficial, with RBLX giving brands better tools to identify and manage the use of their IP. Like with YouTube and others, brands may decide even unofficial content is positive for engagement with their brand, but when they do want to take action, the IP platform lets them do so. It also gives a more formal avenue for brands to identify and chose developers to partner with. The license fees are bespoke negotiations, not a standard rate, but are likely in the ~15% range. He believes these efforts legitimize RBLX as a more serious media and engagement platform. It's still in the testing phase, but brands are already starting to use it.",

GEEIQ has tracked over 1,050 brand activations on RBLX since 2022, and another 564 on Fortnite. The first activations were brands working with RBLX developers to build bespoke experiences for their brands, the cost could range from &#36;1M-&#36;2M, and be very hit or miss given the quality of the experience itself. Since the cost to create a branded experience has come down to ~&#36;200k due to competition among devs and better dev tools including AI.",

These can range from entire themed updates, to just some branded items, but moves branding in RBLX more similar to existing social channels. Most bullishly, Mr. Hambro is seeing brands shift RBLX spend from their innovation budget to their always-on marketing and social media departments, with localized teams increasingly giving decisions. This places RBLX closer to the media alongside TV, ping,and social media often part of broader campaigns. Separately, he said GEEIQ has not seen a large reaction from brands to the recent child safety headlines.",
