We see improving visibility in execution of the industry control on unauthorized capacity in 2026E, post the grace period in 2025E, given the industry execution guidelines recently published. We expect improving domestic cement unit profit in 2026E and 2027E, leading to \\(34\\%\\) and \\(3\\%\\) earnings growth for the period. We view risk reward as attractive - an implied valuation of HK\\$16.5/sh at the industry bottom (assuming Rmb55/t in unit GP for conch), and HK\\$37.0/sh (assuming Rmb105/t in unit GP, if strong execution of the industry supply work comes through).

The company's sales are in the eastern, central, southern and western regions, supplying the construction market in infrastructure and property. We see improving visibility in execution of the industry control on unauthorized capacity in 2026E, post the grace period in 2025E, given the industry execution guidelines recently published. We expect improving domestic cement unit profit in 2026E and 2027E, leading to \\(34\\%\\) and \\(3\\%\\) earnings growth for the period. We view risk reward as attractive - an implied valuation of \\(\\mathsf{HK}\\$ 16.5 / \\mathsf{sh}\\) at the industry bottom (assuming Rmb55/t in unit GP for conch), and \\(\\mathsf{HK}\\$ 37.0 / \\mathsf{sh}\\) (assuming Rmb105/t in unit GP, if strong execution of the industry supply work comes through).
