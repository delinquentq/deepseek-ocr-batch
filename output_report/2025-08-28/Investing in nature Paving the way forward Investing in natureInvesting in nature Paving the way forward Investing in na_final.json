Instead, investors have increasingly prioritised discrete topics where data availability is most complete and financial materiality is clearest. The two themes on which we have seen growing convergence have been water (Adapting to Water Risks: Tech Solutions for Mining and Chemicals) and deforestation (Deforestation, company impacts, and a palm oil case study - in 16 slides).

However, restricting the universe to only those bonds that have allocated to nature projects shows average allocations of 29% and 44% of proceeds, respectively1. We have seen a sharp increase in the average allocation of these bonds towards nature-related categories, with green and sustainability bonds issued in 2024 seeing average allocations of 44% and 86%, respectively.2 This suggests that corporate issuers are increasingly recognising the importance of natural capital to their operations, with ESG bonds emerging as an important instrument to finance these projects.

While we note that companies are talking about biodiversity more, this is often surface- level. We see more companies talking about the importance of nature; however, disclosures of a company's specific biodiversity footprint using a metric such as mean species abundance (MSA) remains very low. Given the challenges for corporates in accurately calculating metrics such as the MSA, in our view, this is unlikely to be the pre- eminent data point that investors should be relying on.

Blue bonds have also emerged as a subset of the green bond market geared towards ocean- economy projects (ICMA publishes Blue Bond guidance), although issuance has been slow to take off (Corporate ESG bond issuance: Q2 25 update). More recently, the Nature Bond designation has been introduced by ICMA as an instrument geared towards raising capital specifically for nature projects (Weekly Spotlight: ICMA introduces Nature Bonds, clarifies position on defence).",
