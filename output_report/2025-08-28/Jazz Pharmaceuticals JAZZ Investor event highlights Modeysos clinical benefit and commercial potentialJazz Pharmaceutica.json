Per scientific literature, intracranial DMGs originating in patients' brainstems were, historically, diagnosed solely radiographically (due in part to the locations of the tumors introducing considerable risk to the use of surgical biopsy), causing a dearth of tumor tissue available for molecular testing and creating a hurdle around research efforts in understanding the disease biology/viable therapeutic options. Thus, DMGs represent the number one cause of pediatric cancer death, with pediatric high- grade gliomas (HGGs) in the brainstem comprising \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) of all pediatric brain tumors (80% of which are located in the pons) and resulting in death in nearly all patients within two years of diagnosis (median survival \\(\\sim 9\\) months). Moreover, the H3 K27M mutation—first discovered in approximately 2012 (following surgical advancements in biopsy methodologies which may have spurred a reclassification of DMG from its previous categorization of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG); link)—has been associated with increased mortality versus wild- type tumors in both pediatric and adult patients. Because the tumors are largely resistant to traditional therapies due to their location and molecular features (associated with the tumors' aggressive nature), radiation therapy remains the primary SoC therapeutic option, though is primarily palliative (link) and has demonstrated little- to- no benefit on patients' risk of disease progression (research suggests \\(\\sim 70\\% - 80\\%\\) of patients respond initially with transient improvement in their neurological symptoms, though most experience disease progression after roughly six months post- treatment).",

(Exhibit 1) In the study, patients are randomized to receive either dordaviprone 625mg BIW, dordaviprone 625mg QW (in addition to placebo QW), or placebo BIW. The trial's primary endpoints are OS and progression- free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including (but not limited to) the incidence of AEs, corticosteroid response, and performance status response. Per JAZZ, the trial is designed as an opportunity for patients to receive treatment preemptively to prevent disease progression and, as a result, experience the greatest opportunity for benefit (management cited its similar rationale for the Ph3 IMforte trial of Zepzelca in the 1L ES- SCLC setting). With respect to the possibility of differences in the split of adult versus pediatric patients between ACTION and the integrated analysis which supported the approval in the recurrent setting, JAZZ noted that although there may be some variance in the former from the latter, it does not expect any such variance to create challenges given dordaviprone's activity across age groups. Additionally, the KOL at the event shared expectations of a larger effect size in the ACTION trial versus in the recurrent setting (based on a historic precedent in which targeted therapies demonstrate less efficacy in recurrent compared to 1L treatment settings).",

Regulatory Risk: With many, albeit promising, assets undergoing preclinical and clinical development, any threats to regulatory approval including delayed and/or unsatisfactory clinical trial results would create downside risk. Competitive Risk: Despite existing patent and orphan drug protection for many commercial and pipeline assets, the threat of market entry by branded or non- authorized generic competitors following the expiration of patents/exclusivity periods produces additional downside risk.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
