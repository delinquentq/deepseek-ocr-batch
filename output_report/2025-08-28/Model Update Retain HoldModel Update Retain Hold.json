The key points are 1) The company is preparing to add another bank for the provision of group credit insurance, 2) The company estimates that online insurance accounts for around \\(1 - 2\\%\\) of which Lifenet has \\(30 - 40\\%\\) market share vs around \\(10\\%\\) in car insurance, so there is room to grow, 3) Currently there is enough capital without immediate fundraising. Equity issuance will depend on future big projects and there is no point in just increasing equity as it will be a hindrance to ROE, 4) From the competitive market, Lifenet is not trying to be the cheapest provider, but it wants to be the best at UI and UX.",

However, if growth in individual insurance and adding another bank to provide mortgage insurance do not occur quickly enough, management may come under pressure. The company has a mid- term target of \\(200 - 240bn\\) in comprehensive equity and a \\(3,000\\) share price for FY28 (i.e., three years' time). We believe that the share price target in particular will probably have to be revised up to meet current investor expectations.",
