Overall, 1H25 EBITDA beat prospectus/MSe due to higher settlements (119 actual vs 117 MSe), higher price, and lower OHs, while D&A also came in below guidance. We have extended some of these savings (OHs, D&A) into 2H25+, however, we retain a conservative approach to settlements with no change to our original forecasts (214 lots in 2H25, 382 in FY26, 432 in FY27). Our FY26e OPAT is now A \\(86.5m\\) (was A \\(82.9m\\) ).",
