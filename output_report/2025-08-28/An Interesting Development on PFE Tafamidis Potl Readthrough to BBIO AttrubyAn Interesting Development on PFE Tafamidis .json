The motive is unclear, but Bulls argue PFE may be defending its TAF franchise ( \\(6.2B+\\) runrate) against generic Vyndaquel in 2028.

(1) Currently at a \\(\\) 6B+\\(runrate, PFE's Vynda family includes Vyndaquel (4x/ day) and Vyndamax (1x/day). (2) In March 2025, PFE stated its base case for tafamidis was a 2028 loss - of - exclusivity (LOE), even though Vyndamax (QD dosing) has a'441 polymorph patent expiring in 2035, (3) Should gVyndaquel be introduced as early as 2028, a key question is how BBIO sales could be impacted (i.e. whether a cheaper generic will create step - edits for Attruby), (4) That said, if BBIO Attruby proves to be superior/differentiated in the real - world over the next 1 - 2 years (solidifying its place as 1L therapy), then PFE generics could become a moot point.",

(2) Specifically, with PFE now marketing only Vyndamax and Vyndaquel volumes potentially declining to zero over the next 2- 3 years, generics could face challenges in marketing gVyndaquel (4x/day) over other potentially better options, such as BBIO Attruby (pot'I suppler efficacy), PFE Vyndamax (1x/day convenience), and ALNY Amvuttra (different MOA). (3) Vyndamax's script volumes are 80- 85% of PFE's overall mix, suggesting 1x/ day option is meaningful for 4x/day, (4) Said another way, PFE did not need to pursue a patient migration strategy to Vyndamax in the first place. (5) We wonder if a portion of 15- 20% Vyndaquel patients could consider switching to Attruby (instead of Vyndamax), given an additional touchpoint with HCs who may lean towards a potentially more effective option. (6) To be clear, we do not think PFE's move delays the possibility of Vyndaquel generics entering in 2028.",

We expect BBIO to continue generating real - world data to elucidate Attruby's differentiation. Contrary to some investor thinking, we believe an H2H study against tafamidis is unnecessary to prove differentiation. Our docs expect to know within the next 6- 24 months, by assessing 3- 6 month serum biomarkers (e.g., NT- proBNP, troponin, albumin) and tracking 2- year efficacy outcomes. BBIO also has ATTR stabilization, serum TTR (switching), variant, and reduced AFib data to suggest Attruby is more potent.
