While this does stoke the Alchip share loss debate, MRVL was clear that everything remains on track. For us, MSFT is a much bigger driver for the story but that is a late C26 storyline.",

Optical strength follows similar commentary from transceiver/component providers seeing strength. Initial volume shipments for 1.6T DSPs have already begun and the stronger optical market commentary on 1.6T ramping should be a continued tailwind for the business. The big recovery in Enterprise/Carrier helps fill some of the gap with ASICs expected to snap back in Q4. While the business ex-ASIC sounded better and commentary around XPU attach is seeing continued momentum, there was little on the call to help equal the fears on the ASIC roadmap with the major customers.",
