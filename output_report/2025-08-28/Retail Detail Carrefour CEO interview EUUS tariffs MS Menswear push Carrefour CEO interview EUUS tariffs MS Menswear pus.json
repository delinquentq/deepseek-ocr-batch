We use a common DCF methodology for all our companies (formulaic fade rates, capex fading towards depreciation, etc). The two key inputs - apart from WACC, which is necessarily somewhat subjective - are for the terminal margin and growth rates. For Carrefour we assume a terminal EBIT margin of \\(3.4\\%\\) , slightly up compared with the level we forecast in 2027E. We think this is realistic given the structural constraints on the company's margins (formats, real estate, franchises). We assume \\(1.5\\%\\) terminal sales growth, which is at the lower end of the \\(1.0 - 2.5\\%\\) range that we use for companies in the sector - reflecting its exposure to a mix of mature European markets and developing markets. 'Sum- of- the- parts. We apply different EV/sales multiples on the various segments, reflecting their expected profit margins and growth rates. We are most generous with the French convenience business ( \\(35\\%\\) ), Spain ( \\(35\\%\\) ) and Brazil ( \\(35\\%\\) ) and most cautious with French hypermarkets ( \\(22\\%\\) ). Both methodologies generate a value of approximately €15.75 and we use this as our price target.",
