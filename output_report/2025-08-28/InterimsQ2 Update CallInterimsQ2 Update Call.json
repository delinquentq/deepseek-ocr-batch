Average LTM EBITDA growth was 10% as at 30/06/25, against 12% as at 31/03/25. Here we continue to note the valuation multiple looks stretched relative to the level of growth from the portfolio, although appreciate the potential for distortions within the average numbers. To this end, the Chairman's statement in the interim report highlighted that 'over the past twelve months portfolio companies with positive EBITDA growth accounted for over 75% of NAV, and those growing EBITDA in excess of 10% represented close to half of portfolio NAV'. In turn, this indicates there are some holdings with declining EBITDA that are materially dragging on the portfolio average. We expect this relates to the 'underperforming positions' as mentioned on the Q1 call.",

Deducting the gross cash of €8.3m, but adding the €20m of RCF drawings, results in a current hurdle of €82m for activation of share buybacks under the capital allocation policy. This is against expected distributions (net of reinvestment amounts) of €85m from PCI Pharma and Techem, both of which are due to close in H2. In reality, some additional distributions from other holdings are likely to be received, so we would expect share buybacks to be activated at one of the next two quarterly testing points for the policy, depending on the exact timing of the PCI Pharma and Techem completions.",
