      "text": "Message from the conference Call was mixed, with on the positive side reassuring that it can deliver a sequential acceleration in growth and sustain margin though in all fairness management was non- committal on organic growth or organic EBIT progression. Net net as we wrote this morning, despite the FY25 beat we see pressure on FY26 earnings drivers and would expect LSD cut to FY26 on higher FX and perimeter impact while we also see some slight downside to consensus organic sales and EBIT. Key points: 1) very weak start to FY26 with weak Q1 likely \\(- 5 - 6\\%\\) (aligned with Q125 - 5.9%) due to inventory destocks in China, the US and weak India, and tough start in Europe/Poland 2) sequential recovery throughout the year given India normalization, H2 stabilization in China, China Travel retail resuming, competitive performance in Europe, 3) management aims to protect margin, though it remains unclear to us whether organic margin will be at least flat \\((\\cos +20\\) bps appears optimistics) given CFO mentioning GM pressure from tariffs, high bar from FY25 efficiencies and higher COGS from wet goods, 4) overall spirits market remain sudd, with limited potential to raise prices in major markets including the USA, where we expect inventory destocks to linger throughout the year. While the market has cheered FY25 beat and potential for sequential acceleration in organic performance in FY26, we believe the potential negative earnings momentum in FY26 with risk of LSD cut to consensus and a very weak start the the year reducing FY26 visibility may dent some of this after the stock re- rated to c16x PE26E calendar since June lows.",

RTD) with only Tequila growing but early greenshoots in Irish Whiskey category led by Jameson back into growth. Management noted distributor inventory adjustments post sell- in ahead of tariffs will be skewed to Q126 but will occur throughout FY26 as distributors work to avoid being too lean into OND. It has not seen price increases post tariffs to date given the environment is pressured with purchasing power weakness and consumer perceiving that prices remain high. Pernod is narrowing the gap to market with continued investments behind brands, innovation and expects a solid OND season. Pernod has also signed new distribution agreements with US partners designed to increase execution capabilities.",

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.",
