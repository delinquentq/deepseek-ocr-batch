SPDB would be able to promote a full conversion of its CBs if its share price stays above RMB13.761 by maturity (28 Oct 2025) or promote a mandatory conversion of its CBs if its share price stays above RMB16.263 for at least 15 out of 30 consecutive trading days. SPDB is now trading at one of the highest P/B to ROE multiples and offering one of the lowest dividend yields among banks under our coverage. It will likely see notable dilution and its profit growth advantage over peers will likely narrow notably post its potential CB conversion. Maintain Underperform.",
