      "text": "On 8/22, the US Court for International Trade declared the two- year moratorium on collecting duties on solar imports from Southeast Asia was illegal. As a result, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) could immediately start collecting retroactive duties on cells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam during the two- year period, per the release. While the case could be appealed, our illustrative scenario implies CSIQ may have more potential negative exposure to retroactive duties as a result of this ruling compared to JKS. We provide more details on the decision below.",

      "text": "Background. On June 6, 2022, President Biden issued Proclamation 10414 to support continued deployments of solar in the US by enacting a two- year moratorium on the anti- dumping (AD) and anti- subsidy (CVD) duties on solar imports from Southeast Asia from June 6, 2022, through June 6, 2024, with imported products during that period needing to be installed in projects by December 3, 2024. During this two- year pause, as a result of this moratorium the CBP was directed by the U.S. Department of Commerce to not collect duties. However, Auxin Solar and Concept Clean Energy challenged the decision, alleging that it exceeded presidential authority and was unlawful. On 12/29/23, plaintiffs filed a complaint to contest the two- year moratorium on the anti- dumping (AD) and anti- subsidy (CVD) duties on solar imports from Southeast Asia.",

As a result, we believe the retroactive duties could cause financial uncertainty for the importers of the products as well as the project developers/utilities.",
