The new datapoints are broadly encouraging, supporting prior updates in July (here and here) where Louise flagged that she sees the region stabilising in the 2H. A key positive is the recovery in handbag imports from Europe, which has the highest correlation to sector underlying growth (Europe to China Leather handbag imports are \\(+7\\%\\) in July, the first positive month since Jan 2024). Data has some negatives too, including July total retail sales missing expectations, but the categories most correlated with underlying sector growth showed sequential improvement. Louise maintains the view that we have seen a bottom and China can stabilise in 2H, albeit off a low base. Stocks: Her relative preference remains for LVMH (Buy, on Conviction List) which typically outperforms the industry as the cycle recovers (as discussed here). From high end exposure, Buy BCU and ZGN. Remains cautious on turnarounds against tough backdrop (Sell Kering).",

With this acquisition, Halma has committed c. £2bn of capital across 95 acquisitions over the last 20 years, funded out of FCF.
