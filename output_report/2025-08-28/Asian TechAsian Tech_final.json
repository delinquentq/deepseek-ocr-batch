Although some China customers have acquired US government licence approval with H20 production readiness, management said they have not shipped any H20 chips to China customers since the H20 ban in April and continue to work on geopolitical issues. We have highlighted continued H20 uncertainty as the China government has been increasingly concerned about H20 procurement by local customers.

Management said Nvidia has already booked tens of billions of dollars of GB300 revenues in Jul- Q with smooth rack- level system ramp now. This echoes our research that board production has kicked off in CY2Q with initial GB300 system ramp from late July to August. We expect improving GB200/300 rack unit shipments in the next few months. For the next generation, Rubin platform chips, including Rubin GPU, Vera CPU, CX9 SuperNIC, NVLink 144 scale- up, Spectrum- X scale- out, and Silicon Photonics processor, have all been taped out at TSMC and volume production remains on track for next year (we expect TSMC to start production in 2Q26). Given the similar rack architecture, we expect a smooth transition from GB300 to Vera Rubin, which bodes well for key AI server ODMs (Hon Hai, Quanta, and Wistron). We expect chip mass production in mid to late 2Q26 and system mass production in 2H26. The strong performance upgrades also bode well for component vendors such as power (Delta), substrate (Unimicron), and CCL (EMC).",

Nvidia's networking revenue grew \\(+46\\% / + 98\\%\\) QoQ/YoY to a record high US \\(7.3bn\\) in Jul- Q, mainly driven by strength across Spectrum- X, Infiniband, and NVLink switches. Nvidia's near- term revenue momentum is likely to sustain given continued GB200/300 NVL72 ramp in 2H25. In the mid to longer term, as GPU clusters continue to grow (e.g., from NVL 8 to NVL72 in single node, from 100k to 1mn GPU clusters in AI datacenters), we expect to see rising demand for GPU interconnection (both inside- rack and inter- rack), driving secular networking TAM expansion (both scale- up and scale- out, as well as scale- across multiple GW scale datacenters).

This approach enables customers to maximize AI output from limited power budgets and drive the highest margins from AI token sales. While aggressive ASIC developments are going on in the market, we believe that NVIDIA's comprehensive solution remains a strong contender, as not every ASIC will succeed in the market. We thus would suggest investors to focus on the supply chain of Nvidia or established ASIC vendors (e.g. AWS, Google, etc.). For 2026, we expect the GOOG TPU supply chain to see the fastest growth among AI Accelerators.",
