While the EUR rally seems to have stalled (and is unable to break above 1.18), we believe a new dimension in the form of RMB appreciation has entered the market that could result in re- anchoring of EM Asia FX vs the USD and EUR. Moreover, our tariff table indicates that most EM Asian currencies aren't necessarily overvalued, maybe with the exception of CNH and TWD. But adjusting for the DXY move, even the overvaluation in these currencies reduces. IDR and KRW remain two of the most undervalued currencies in the region. RMB appreciation could also have an impact on MYR, given the outsized correlation and beta seen.",

Camp 1 where we see monetary policy space as well as favorable supply/demand dynamics having a positive impact on duration - Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia. Camp 2 where the policymakers' bias is shifting away from monetary stimulus towards fiscal stimulus by choice or by a lack of choice. Korea and India fall in this camp and in the next few months, maybe Thailand would join this camp as well. China, Singapore and Taiwan are in camp 3 where there is nothing common that binds them but more like idiosyncratic stories are driving the narrative in these places.",

We believe US rates can adjust further, allowing for positive EMFX developments. That said, a stubborn 5- 30s steepening bias may persist. EMFX carry strategies remain positive, cushioned by interest rate differentials. Key economic data over the next few weeks may suggest a Fed cut in September, but the US economy could reflate faster than expected, challenging EM assets. Our view remains positive interest rate risk in EM, supported by EMFX contributions to total returns in portfolios. We remain positive on EM interest rate risk, expecting EMFX to contribute to portfolio returns. Reduced net non- commercial VIX contracts suggest potential vulnerability to a US equity risk correction. Constructive energy inflation contribution is expected to remain dominant until the beginning of 2026. See: Emerging Markets Strategy Weekly - Carefully Trudging Along in EM Risk",

BoK's recent rate cuts in February'25 and May'25 were preceded by one dovish minority opinion for a rate cut as well as six MPB members' rate cut guidance in January'25 and April'25, respectively (see Figure 1). However, we continue to assume only one 25bps cut during BoK Governor Rhee's term till April 2026 as we believe the governor would remain concerned about over- delivery of monetary easing compared to under- delivery of monetary easing. We maintain our view of a slow- paced BoK rate cutting cycle, with expectations for a 25bps cut each in October'25, May'26 and October'26 towards a \\(1.75\\%\\) terminal rate.

We believe there is room for RMB to appreciate in the next few months for the following reasons: 1) Sentiment around Chinese equities seems to be running high driven by liquidity; 2) PBoC&#x27;s fixing bias has clearly been towards RMB appreciation since May; 3) FX hoarding from Chinese exporters has reduced considerably since Q2. 4) political need for RMB appreciation to show some goodwill as we head into possible US-China summit in the next few months. Risks to this trade: 1) re-escalation of trade war; 2) fading away of positive sentiment around Chinese equities due to poor domestic data.0.84%1.6%0+20bpPay 3m fwd 1s 5s INR NDOISWe like to pay 3m fwd 1s 5s INR NDOIS at 28.3 bps targeting a move towards 52bps and a stop of 10 bps with a size of 10k in dvo1. Risks to the trade include: 1) stronger growth or inflation data that pushes back against further rate cut expectations; 2) de-escalation in current US-India tariffs situation; and 3) lack of fiscal response.27.3bp52bp10bp-1bpAdded USD/HDK forward longWe add our 1y USD/HDK outright (now about 10m remaining, link to original trade) at 7.7300, so that our average entry is 7.7375. We target a move to 7.80 on the outright but adjust the top to 7.68. USD/HDK has moved lower significantly in the last few days, despite a lower HSI, and 1y outright USD/HDK has moved to the lowest since 2008. Risks to the trade: 1) stronger equity sentiment driving demand for HKD, 2) tight short term funding cost causes carry unwind.7.7507.807.68+0.16%Long China 1y NCD with FX and front end payer hedgeWe buy 1y NCD at 2.01%, with 1y USD/CNY FX hedge at -2042 (spot ref 7.2690) with target and stop adjusted to 250bp and 170bp respectively. China&#x27;s front-end has sold off rather significantly with recent tight funding conditions. With big banks not lending aggressively but instead raising liquidity via NCDs at higher yields, supply of liquidity on repo was rather limited. As investors onshore had to sell bonds to gain access to liquidity, bonds have underperformed swaps. As funding conditions are expected to marginally improve from March onwards, there is room for NCD and bonds to outperform swaps. With 1y NCD now around MLF levels, and 1-3y CGBs near policy rate levels, the absolute level of yields has become more reasonable in our view. Risks to the trade: 1) further tightening of banks&#x27; funding conditions driving NCD yields disproportionately higher than repo; 2) sharply lower USDCNY points.1.63%250bp170bp+288bpReceive TWD 2y1y NDIRSWe recommend switching TWD NDIRS receiver from 1y to 2y1y. We close 1y1y receive at 1.31% and receive 2y1y at 1.42%, with target of 1.2% and stop of 1.6%. The roll is -10bp in 1y. Risks to the trade: Rapid de-escalation of tariff situation reducing rate cut expectations. We recommend going short SGD vs basket of USD (26%), CNH (16%), EUR (12%), IDR (7%), JPY (7%), AUD (7%), THB (5%), KRW (5%), INR (5%), TWD (5%), GBP (5%). We enter this trade at 100 with a target of 98 and stop of 100.5. Estimated entry is +9bps per month (exclusive of slope). Size: USD 50mio notional. Risks to the trade: 1) Tariff exemption extension with no sectoral tariffs might delay the need to move in policy settings; 2) Given the strong fiscal position, Singapore policymakers might use fiscal policy more aggressively especially as ongoing trade negotiations might limit the flexibility on FX; 3) Ongoing FX hedging flows as well as Singapore safe-haven status might mean that operationally, a weaker SGNEER might be more difficult to achieve.1.66%1.20%1.60%-20bpShort SGD vs. BasketWe recommend receiving 1y KRW NDIRS – Entry: 2.365%, Target: 2.10%, Stop: 2.55%. We engage with size: 10k DVO1. Front end rates have been stuck in a narrow range of 2.34-2.40% given the tug of war between trade tariffs and expansionary fiscal policy impact on growth and consumption. Worries around the housing market have complicated the narrative. Overall, we believe this narrative will get resolved in favor of rate cuts and (consequently lower front end swap rates). Risks to the trade: 1) Longer than expected stabilization in housing prices pushing back a rate cut; 2) If KRW weakness goes beyond 1400 again, it could pose risks to easing especially if the Fed were to remain on hold this year.100.2198100.5-0.21%Receive 1s 3s 10s Thai NDOISWe recommend receiving 1s 3s 10s Thai NDOIS – Entry: -48bp (Swap Ref: 1y: 1.313%, 3y: 1.213%, 10y: 1.59%), Target: -65bp, Stop: -35bp, Carry is estimated at +2.5bp/m.

      "text": "AllocationBrief Description of Rationale and Risks-1% (CNY)We retain (-1%) u/w CNY in our EM bond portfolio. We believe there is room for RMB to appreciate in the next few months for the following reasons:1) Sentiment around Chinese equities seems to be running high driven by liquidity; 2) PBoC&#x27;s fixing bias has clearly been towards RMB appreciation since May; 3) FX hoarding from Chinese exporters has reduced considerably since Q2. 4) political need for RMB appreciation to show some goodwill as we head into possible US-China summit in the next few months. We express this view by going long 2m USD put/CNH call ATM. However, we prefer to keep u/w CNY as a nice offset to MYR and IDR o/w, while maintaining a net short USD view.+0.1CTD (IDR)We retain o/w Indonesia duration (+0.1CTD) to the EM bond portfolio. Bl cut policy rates which was a surprise to consensus view for a hold. We latest Bl headlines as incrementally dovish and expect the OMO curve to remain flat to alleviate funding pressures and support growth. Together with potential spillover demand into IndogGBs and further policy rate cuts, we remain o/w duration (+0.1CTD) to the EM bond portfolio.+1% (IDR)We add (+1%) o/w IDR in our EM bond portfolio. IDR NEER continues to trade cheaply despite the return of foreign portfolio inflows into bonds. This has been mostly offset by a similar degree of foreign selling in local equities. But foreign ownership of equities at 46% likely already reflects lightened foreign investor positioning. IDR has lagged the move when compared to 10y IndogGB. Global risk on sentiment as well as potential dovishness from the Fed could cause IDR to rally. As a result, we like to express a long IDR view through long USD put/IDR call (2m expiry: 25 Sep&#x27;25) with strike 16,300 and European knock out at 16,000 at 0.21% premium paid (link).+1% (MYR)We add (+1%) o/w MYR in our EM bond portfolio. Despite subdued commodities prices and continued signs of exports payback, the latest trade surplus for Jun continues to hold up, and was in fact still large on imports compression. We also expect the USD to turn weaker in the coming months with Ringgit&#x27;s beta to the broad USD leaving the MYR as an attractive overweight, in our view.",
