Of note (i) Yesterday saw a record \\(\\mathrm{HK}\\) 20.4bn of SB outflows - and historically, periods where we saw a big \\(>HK\\) 10bn outflow print have preceded sideways moves in both HSCEI and SHCOMP the next 2x and 4x weeks, (ii) Margin finance has increased by \\(58\\%\\) y/y, and the last time this figure exceeded \\(50\\%\\) (July- 2020), both the HSCEI and SHCOMP traded sideways the next 3- 4 months. This doesn't change our underlying constructive view on China - based on a looser policy backdrop a focus on improving the S/D balance, but it does imply a near term breather is quite likely. Elsewhere, highlighting (i) Rajiv & Mixo have published an excellent strategy note updating on positioning across the region - they remain constructive but also warn to about crowding in certain pockets of the market, (ii) Hannah & Alan publish timely note on APAC's clean energy transition, discussing the 5x key themes and 2x emerging technologies, (iii) Senior US economist Joe Lupton will host a call at 8am HK today - well worth joining.",

India's 2Q GDP is expected to show strong real GDP growth of near \\(7\\%\\) y/y, driven by the services sector - which is anticipated to grow \\(>8\\%\\) . This growth is supported by a low GDP deflator due to a significant drop in WPI inflation. However, nominal GDP growth is expected to soften to \\(8\\%\\) - the lowest in several years. This softening has implications for tax collections, debt dynamics, and expectations for credit growth and corporate earnings. Looking forward, Sajjid expects the GDP deflator to remain low, leading to a convergence in real and nominal GDP growth the next few quarters. A near \\(7\\%\\) GDP growth rate later this week may give the impression India has been immune to the building global uncertainty in 2025 and the \\(10\\%\\) tariffs imposed in April, however challenges such as tariffs and global uncertainty may impact future growth.

      "text": "APAC MARKET THEMATICS - TOP IDEASStrategy/ EcoHeading into a Fed \"restart\" rate cut cycle, the global liquidity backdrop remains supportive - with lower rates and a lower US dollar. Looking at the past 6x times the Fed re-started cuts, the USD drifted 4-5% lower the next 6m and EM equities outperformed by 5%/15% the next 6/12m. And this is not a typical Fed easing cycle... the Fed is set to ease into rising inflation, and at a time when independence concerns are growing. Lower real yields = a lower dollar, which remains 10-15% overvalued on REER. At the same time policymakers in China &amp;amp; Korea are starting to address deep-rooted economic and policy headwinds, and Asia valuations &amp;amp; positioning remain relatively attractive. Stay constructive.Strategy/ AnalystJAPAN BANKS - Inflation running hot, BOJ needs to hike... Japan is running a highly negative real yield policy (10Y JGB less CPI = -1.8%) policy, driving inflation. The BOJ was purposely behind the curve, but is falling too far behind, creating JGB and JPY risks. Expect +25bps hike in Oct. Topix Banks at 1x P/B are leveraged into front-end yield hikes.Strategy/ AnalystCHINA CONSUMER - Bullish into Oct Plenary... China&#x27;s Oct Plenary will see Beijing discuss its upcoming Five Year Plan for the first time. This likely focuses on improving S/D including via lifting Consumption. Position ahead of the event in attractively valued consumer leaders, e.g. Anta, Yum-C, Galaxy, CR Beer all trade &amp;lt;10x 26 EV/EBITDA.Strategy/ AnalystKOREA VALUE - Mid-cycle optimism... Post the rip, the grind higher. Valuations are now back at the LT average (KOSPI at 10.9x PE), but with 50% upside to global peer comps! Post mean-reversion, the key Q is much of the &quot;Korea discount&quot; will be removed. So far = are pricing zero. JPM 25-50% upside to TP in Shinhan, Samsung Life, Hynix.Strategy/ AnalystAPAC INTERNET - Adopting AI at scale... The integration of AI into digital platforms with huge distribution reach has the potential to be a game-changer for mid-term growth rates - both via Cloud growth acceleration (to support IaaS and AI workloads) and through leveraging ad-tech to boost ad effectiveness and click-through rates. Bullish BABA/Tencent.Strategy/ AnalystASEAN - Trough valuations, time to buy... Valuations are at &quot;close eyes and buy&quot; levels in Indonesia, and parts of Thailand &amp;amp; Philips. Get paid to wait for the cycle to turn, with high div standout = KBANK (10%), BBRI (9%), SCB (8%) &amp;amp; Telkom (6%) - all paying elevated dividends and at/near trough valuations. High yield plus re-rating opportunity.Strategy/ AnalystHIGH DIVIDEND - About as cheap as it gets (into a Fed cut)... High dividend as a style is undervalued, trading at near 10y wide spreads on High vs Low Div P/B across Asia. While High Div is not the style to own if cyclically bullish, it&#x27;s a good hedge especially into a Fed cut cycle. Favour non-China yield plays... HK property, Indo banks, Korea banks, Korea autos.Strategy/ AnalystCHINA PIVOT - Structural policy shift... China could be on the verge of a significant pivot, with a greater focus on demand (leading to a more balanced S/D framework), while keeping policy loose (see equity vs yield disconnect). Expect ERP to compress and Growth expectations to be revised higher. Longer-term, favour ChiNext vs CSI-300.Strategy/ AnalystFINANCIAL DISRUPTION - Multi-year change... Wall Street is belatedly embracing digitalisation - via digital deposits. This is occurring alongside the proliferation of stablecoins and digital asset tokenisation. Is this as big as fiat&#x27;s gold delink in terms of unleashing innovation. Key impact (i) Exchanges vs brokers - blurred lines? (ii) Payments - Rails disruption?",
