Both CCL and PCB sectors have seen very robust share price moves in the past weeks (MTD shares up 20- 25% for the major names; vs. 3% for Taiex), driven by increasing discussions of supply tightness, plus the concerns for rising raw material supplies tightness (copper foil, glass fiber, etc) in the coming year. Across the board, the shares are trading at practically all- time high multiples since early 2023 (the inception of Al boom). While we expect the tightness for PCB and CCL to continue in the coming year (and likely beyond) on robust spec migration, we do wish to highlight that a potential moderation in rerating could take place in the next 1- 3 months.

Our revenue estimates contemplate 2Q hardware revenue remaining fairly flat with 1Q, despite it being a historically stronger quarter due to seasonality, taking into account the mixed impacts of potential pre- buying in the first half of this year ahead of anticipated tax credit phase- outs or tariffs, which could result in incremental deliveries landing in 2Q, or, customers doubling down on pausing new orders due to a worse EV sales and market penetration outlook in the years to come. While we expect to eventually see revenue uplift from ChargePoint's channel partnership with Eaton, this is set to be more impactful from F3Q onward once the partnership is operationalized and new offerings are announced in the coming weeks. We expect gross margins to improve slightly on a sequential basis, though largely still weighted to the 2H of the year as existing inventory is sold through before we see the benefit of ChargePoint's new, lower- cost hardware roll through. Although management has remained committed to turning EBITDA breakeven exiting this year, this will largely depend on meaningful H/H revenue and margin growth; based on our calculations, ChargePoint would need to reach \\(\\sim\\) 140M+ of revenue, \\(20\\% +\\) hardware gross margins, and maintain relatively flat opex to achieve this on a run- rate basis in F4Q, which still feels highly ambitious to us.

For the Oct- Qtr, the team guided revenue to \\(\\) 54B\\(above consensus\\) \\ \\(53.4B\\) and towards the high end of our expectation of \\(\\) 53- 54B\\(. We see a sufficient ramp in the supply chain for Blackwell/Blackwell Ultra rack volumes (affirmed by NVDA's indication that it is now run- rating \\~12k racks/quarter) to comfortably support the incremental \\~\\) 5B of Compute revenue implied by NVDA's guide (based on our model). Overall, we believe NVIDIA's 12- month forward order book continues to outstrip supply. H20 potentially provides a \\(\\) 2- 5B\\(or more) upside revenue lever to FQ3, though this remains in question pending the resolution of \"geopolitical issues,\" despite certain Chinese customers having already been granted export licenses by the US government. Networking growth has certainly been a standout recently, with revenue up \\~140% in the span of just two quarters, driven by a combination of higher networking content per rack (primarily NVLink scale- up networking) for Blackwell relative to Hopper, and NVDA's expanding portfolio of networking solutions, which now includes \"scale across\" Spectrum- XGS ethernet (for which CoreWeave has been announced as an initial customer). All in, the playbook remains the same here for NVDA - a solid beat and raise with multiple levers at play to drive upside, against the backdrop of a multi- year runway of growth for AI infrastructure spending, with NVDA in our view continuing to capture a",
