The recent Independent Expert has concluded the Scheme is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of GOR shareholders in the absence of a superior proposal. The GOR Board continues to unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme. GOR intends to declare a fully franked special dividend should the Scheme become effective, where based on the franking account balance (A\\(185mm in Jun- 25) the special dividend would equate to \\~A\\)0.40/sh (from \\~A\\)0.353/sh on announcement). We do not reflect the pending deal into our estimates and currently see capacity for up to \\~A0.36/sh on cash balance and interim cash generation; record date 1 October. The independent expert report also notes GOR Shareholders will receive the proportional market value of GOR's shareholding in Northern Star (NST; \\~3.44% stake) based on the prevailing day VWAP of Northern Star Shares immediately prior to the Scheme becoming Effective.",
