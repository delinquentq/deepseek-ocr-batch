Coming out of August, oil edged lower on course for a monthly loss, with trading dominated by concerns about a looming glut and geopolitical issues, including US - led efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Russia - Ukraine peace talk continued, and US and Russian officials discussed energy deals alongside according to Reuters. Henry Hub gas prices rallied, reversing partial loss from last week. TTF gas prices declined during the week, reversing strong gains seen last week. With gas demand in Asian markets sagging, Europe gas markets escaped what could have been a hectic LNG summer reinjection/ storage race, expecting a surge of LNG imports over the coming months. During the week, ExxonMobil released its Global Energy Outlook 2025, estimating global natural gas demand to rise more than 20% by 2050 from last year's level. Dropping from the top on last week's scorecard, Refining margins declined during the week, reversing partial gains from previous week.",

      "text": "The European energy sector continued to outperform the broader European market. European indices edged lower as investors assessed the latest political development in France. In addition, German inflation inched up more than expected in August, disappointing investors. UK supermajors BP and Shell were the best performers during the week, outperforming their European peers. BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana was back to operating at normal rates after taking multiple units offline due to a thunderstorm last week. Galp also outperformed the sector and the broader market during the week. \"Refiners\" (Orlen, Neste, both not covered), which led the scorecard last week, dropped along with the declining refining margin during the week. Norwegian player's performance diverged during the week; AkerBP outperformed the sector and general market (although absolute return was muted), while Equinor underperformed and posted negative returns. The divergence could be partially explained by Equinor's exposure to Orsted and US offshore wind, which continue to suffer from the US administration stopping construction at its offshore Revolution Wind project. Equinor has not as yet stated whether it will support Orsted's c. \\(\\) 9\\(bn rights issue. Our view is that Equinor is between a rock and a hard place: (1) throwing good money after bad would likely not be welcome by equity markets even though it can clearly afford the c.\\) \\ \\(900m\\) ; equally (2) it would be seen as an admission of defeat and a strategic mistake (to have bought the 10% stake) were it not to support the rights issue. Either way, the incident coupled with weaker TTF gas prices, depressed Equinor during the week. Meanwhile, behaving as a French domestic equity rather than a global super major, TotalEnergies was the worst- performing large cap in light of the political uncertainty in France where the PM faces a new no- confidence vote over the country's debt crisis. TotalEnergies of course, is a global rather than French company in terms of its cash generation; it did not pay in 2024 French corporate tax, because it was in a loss making position in the country (no upstream of course); nevertheless, as a very large constituent of the CAC 40, the stock will behave temporarily as a French domestic equity and will suffer any capital outflow from the index, triggered by this political/financial crisis.",
