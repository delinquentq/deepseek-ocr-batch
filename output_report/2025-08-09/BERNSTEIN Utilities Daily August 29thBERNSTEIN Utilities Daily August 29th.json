EDF will make 6GW of hydroelectric capacity available to third parties through competitive auctions supervised by the CRE, as part of an agreement with the EC, the prime minister's office said on Thursday. France will shift from a concession to an authorization system for hydropower exploitation, though details are pending. The plan may allow current operators to remain, but it is unclear if foreign utilities can participate. A bill to implement these reforms will be introduced soon. The shift from a concession to an authorization system will impact EDF and SHEM (Engie subsidiary), but excludes infrastructure owned by Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR, subsidiary of Bngie) which has a unique legislative status. This agreement should resolve a 20-year long dispute between the EC and the French commission over the renewal of hydropower concessions that blocked investments in new hydropower capacity. The transfer of ownership of dams from the state to energy companies has been ruled out by a report of the French parliament. To avoid the need for competitive bidding for dams and to reduce EDF's dominant position, EDF will make 6GW of hydroelectric capacity available to third parties (equivalent a third of its capacity). In parallel, EDF's new CEO, Bernard Fontana, told the Parliament that he wanted to increase the group's hydroelectric power in France by \"20%\" or 4 GW, including pumped-storage stations. He later mentioned €4- 4.5bn to modernise hydropower plants.",

Les Echos reports that before the likely fall of Bayrou's government on 8 September, the ministry of energy is working to publish several highly anticipated decrees. Several measures in the pipeline concern solar PV installations. One in particular plans to lower the VAT applied to the installation of solar panels on residential roofs to \\(5.5\\%\\) , starting October 1. This reduction is intended to partially offset two measures decided in the spring: the reduction in installation subsidies and the division by three of the feed-in-tariffs for retail producers. The reduced VAT is conditional on environmental criteria which exclude Chinese material. Some industrials also hope that the government will publish the decree establishing the country's new energy roadmap, which is already two years behind schedule.",

Sweden has proposed to lift its ban on uranium mining to support nuclear energy expansion and reduce reliance on imports. The legal reform, effective January 1, according to Bloomberg aligns with the country's energy transition and the threat of non-compliance with the Paris Agreements. Currently, six reactors supply a third of Sweden's electricity, with state company Vattenfall planning more in coming years. Environment and Climate Minister Romina Pourmokhtari stated, \"I want to reduce this vulnerability in our energy supply and start extracting the uranium that we have here in Sweden.\"",

Hyperscalers, including Oracle, Google, and Microsoft, recently selected as official cloud providers, are investing \\(28bn in the sector. Peak data center demand will reach 6.6-7.7GW, about 4% of Japan's total peak load. However, development lags five years behind the US due to a mismatch between demand and supply timelines, delaying major projects until 2029.

South Korea is not allowed to reprocess spent nuclear fuel without US consent under an agreement. Changing that agreement would mark a major policy change for the US, which has long sought to limit the number of countries with this capability as part of non-proliferation efforts. \"We operate 26 nuclear power plants, buying and bringing in fuel for them every time ... We have been feeling the necessity of being able to reprocess it and to make our own fuel through concentrates,\" Cho said.",
