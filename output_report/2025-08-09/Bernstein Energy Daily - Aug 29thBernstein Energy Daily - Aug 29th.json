U.S. President Donald Trump could quickly lift some sanctions on Russia as a reward to Moscow if peace talks with Ukraine go well, but only Europe can take the bigger steps needed to significantly ease Russia's cash crunch. Trump in recent days has renewed a threat to impose more sanctions and tariffs on Russia and buyers of its oil if there is no progress toward a peaceful settlement in the 3-1/2-year-long war in Ukraine. But it talks go well, he could begin to lift some of the punitive measures. Among Trump's options are releasing seized Russian assets, reopening U.S. lending to Russian banks and corporations, and allowing U.S. oil services companies to return to Russia's far-flung oil and gas fields. Without Europe's cooperation, however, those measures would have limited effect and the most damaging sanctions - including massive restrictions on Russia's global oil trade, the lifeblood of its economy - would stay in place.",

The projections provide the basis for the top U.S. oil producer's long-term strategy and investment.

European gas traders have faced a stressful race against the clock in recent summers as they have scrambled to refill depleted gas storage facilities ahead of winter. But with demand in Asian markets sagging, Europe can expect a surge of liquefied natural gas imports over the coming months, giving the continent's traders and governments a lot more breathing room. Ensuring that European gas supplies were at near- maximum levels before cold weather sets in was once a relatively niche concern, but it became a political imperative after the region sharply reduced pipeline gas imports from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",

(3) Shell's 'net zero by 2050' strategy is to slowly diversify into new low- carbon businesses whilst preserving profitability. Whilst Shell has de- emphasised renewables, as long as all the new low- carbon markets remain tiny (green hydrogen, etc.), and their technologies have yet to be scaled up to commercial scale, uncertainty will remain over whether these new industries' value added (returns minus WACC) will be similar or inferior to that of the legacy oil and gas business. And the answer to that requires time as the company first needs to establish a track record of actual low- carbon returns, in our view. (4) M&A: Shell needs only c. \\(\\) 12- 15bn\\(of cash on the balance sheet to run its business, and currently has c.\\) \\ \\(40bn\\) . This provides it the option, should there be a suitable opportunity, of growing via M&A, be it in the legacy oil/gas business (like Exxon and Chevron mega mergers of 2023), or in the new low- carbon divisions it aspires to build. M&A always carries the risk of value destruction by overpaying/overestimating future cash generation.",
