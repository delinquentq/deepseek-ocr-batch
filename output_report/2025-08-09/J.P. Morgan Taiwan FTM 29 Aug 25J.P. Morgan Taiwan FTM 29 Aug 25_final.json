While this would normally be considered a significant headwind, the global policy easing and China liquidity surge currently underway is providing a strong counter force. In this context, we believe the equity bull market will remain intact and any correction/consolidation will present a buying opportunity. However, it is important to manage risks where positioning is particularly crowded. Looking across LO, HF and Quant investors, we note the highest crowding in Taiwan Tech/Semis and Indo Financials, followed by China Growth stocks (semis, consumer and biotech). Alongside this, ongoing support from monetary policy should eventually warrant a widening of the leadership and outperformance of Cyclicals. We are upgrading the Materials sector to Ow in the AxJ region following our recent allocation changes in India (see report). Within the AxJ region, our pecking order is Korea > India > China > Taiwan > ASEAN. Our key OwS are: China Tech, Internet, Healthcare, Materials, select Financial/Industrials; India Financials, Consumer ex Auto, Materials, Real Estate, Hospitals, select power/defense; Korea Financials, Tech, Holdco; TSMC in Taiwan; and ASEAN Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Healthcare, IT.",

However, we believe the weaker 2025 growth is well- known to the market and demand should gradually pick up in 2H25. For 2026, we see stronger growth potential from its automotive business, driven by meaningful content value increases from new products (e.g. MCU).
