      "text": "The announcement of trade deals and new tariffs rates (19- 20% reciprocal tariffs in general, except 10% for Singapore) - has cleared uncertainties and improved sentiment in ASEAN, bolstering an \\(\\sim 8\\%\\) rally over the past two months. This performance has been led mainly by domestic investors whilst foreigners continue to remain on the sidelines. Only Indonesia received sizable inflows (US \\(\\) 262m\\$ ) whilst the rest of ASEAN continued to see outflows, bringing net outflows to surpass US \\(\\) 12bn\\(YTD, in - line with our previous cautious view. We believe the equity bull market will remain intact in the ASEAN region. In our base case, we expect lower interest rates, stimulative fiscal policies to boost domestic growth, seasonality (4Q - 1Q) and inexpensive valuation to support markets over the next 6 months. This should keep domestic investors favoring risk assets and remaining the key buyers. As foreign investors reassess U.S. exceptionalism and seek broader diversification, ASEAN equities should not be overlooked as potential portfolio diversifiers. Lastly, J.P. Morgan's FX team expects the U.S. dollar to likely weaken after a prolonged period of strength since 2010, which aligns with the interests of the current U.S. administration. A weaker U.S. dollar can further improve debt- servicing capacity by lowering dollar import bills and attracting foreign investment. We reiterate our new targets for ASEAN markets, preferring cyclicals over defensives. Our top picks are: DBS SP, CIMB MK, BDO PM, BBRI IJ, TCB VN, MPACT SP, CIT SP, ICT PM, CPALL TB, KTB TB, ANTM IJ.",

However, a series of recent events, as detailed below, are positive indicators that this long- awaited revenue stream may soon be revitalized. We recently upgraded BH to OW (link) as we believe the revenue momentum from the Middle East market could be reaching its lowest point and is poised for an upswing.

Over the past 1M/3M, CTRA/PWON have delivered 5- 12%/3- 13% outperformance vs MXID (see Indonesia Property: Better 2H25 Outlook). We believe this outperformance is likely to persist as the resumption of BI and Fed rate cuts fuels the narrowing of NAV discounts, which are still at historically low levels of 68/60% for CTRA/PWON despite the recent rally. Idiosyncratic factors could provide further boosts to returns, in our view. CTRA's fundamentals have been resilient and the stock is set to be a key",

However, valuations are elevated, in select cases. Hence, we recommend staying invested for the medium term (link) but would re- position given recent moves.

We are increasing our PT to VND28k, but downgrading to UW. We are increasing our PT for TCB to VND45k, as the bank's ROA advantage (2.5% average in next 3Y) is not fully reflected at current valuations.
