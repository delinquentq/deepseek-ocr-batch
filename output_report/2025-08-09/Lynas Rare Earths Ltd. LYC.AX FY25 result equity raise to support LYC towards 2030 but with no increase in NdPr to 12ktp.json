This includes A\\$150mn to be spent on studies at Mt Weld on further expansion options (carbonatite ore), \\(\\sim\\) A\\$300mn on the further expansion of the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant (LAMP) in Malaysia to 12ktpa of NdPr and a further expansion of the Heavy Rare Earth (HRE) circuit to also produce Samarium (Sm) and Yttrium (Y) in addition to Terbium (Tb) and Dysprosium (Dy), and A\\$200mn on the possible partnering and investing in magnet capacity, noting LYC recently signed an MoU with Korean permanent magnet manufacturer JS Link to collaborate on the development of a 3ktpa capacity NdFeB permanent sintered magnet manufacturing facility near LAMP. The US Seadrift refinery ( \\(\\sim 5.4\\) ktpa of MREC; 2.9ktpa SEG including TbDy, 1.25ktpa of NdPr) appears now on permanent hold with LYC flagging significant uncertainty of the refinery proceeding. This results in LYC losing their free carry on the \\(\\sim\\) US\\$260mn of capex, but LYC is now negotiating off- take with the DoD (and mentioned other countries) who may already be taking some HRE from LAMP, and could take Sm and Y. We note that Mt Weld is rich in HRE with reserves containing 166kt of HREs including 13kt of Dy and 3kt of Tb, and 96kt of Samarium/Europium/Gadolinium (SEG).",

LYC is long Cracking & Leaching (C&L) with \\(\\sim\\) 250ktpa of capacity (kiln feed) between As and Malaysia, has a growing high grade resource at Mt Weld, but we question if LAMP and Mt Weld can be expanded easily beyond 12ktpa of NdPr based on water, power and tailings/waste capacity constraints. That said, our channel ckeks suggest the two European based refineries might be seeking Mixed Rare Earth Carbonate (MREC), that LYC could supply considering their C&L long position, which could be a pathway to increase NdPr to >12ktpa.",

We have included the fully underwritten equity raise, capex for the expansion of LAMP, removed the US refinery from our base case, and have lifted our price assumptions for Tb and Dy and Other HRE slightly (to US \\(350/kg and US\\) 1,200/kg respectively), which has increased our NAV \\(13\\%\\) to \\(\\sim\\) A \\(8.8 / sh\\) .

Past performance is not a guide to future performance, future returns are not guaranteed, and a loss of original capital may occur. Fluctuations in exchange rates could have adverse effects on the value or price of, or income derived from, certain investments.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
