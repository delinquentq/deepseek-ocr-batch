      "text": "Leveraged Credit Forecast Update: Moving the Goalpost: Growth indicators have been resilient with 3Q US GDP tracking above our economists' already upwardly revised estimate of \\(1.5\\%\\) . As well, the Fed has been pulled forward with our economists now forecasting a 25bp cut at each of the next four meetings (Sept, Oct, Dec, Jan). The forecast adjustment by our economists away from an initial cut at the December meeting has also been driven by softer- than- expected inflation readings. Recently, Powell's Jackson Hole remarks confirmed market expectations for the FOMC to cut the funds rate by 25bp at its next meeting in mid- September. And away from Jackson Hole, the Fed has made headlines for a very different reason: the administration's efforts to reshape the Fed. For reference, OIS forwards are fully pricing in only two cuts cumulatively over the next four Fed meetings because of the strength of growth- related data (PMIs, Retail Sales). Meanwhile, 2Q was one of the strongest earnings season in years for HY companies with guidance also very strong in aggregate (High Yield Earnings Tracker). And with the lowest yields for leveraged credit issuers since 2022, HY/LL companies have accessed capital markets in droves with the past 3 months' refinancing in- line with 2024's record pace (\\$56bn per month Jun- Aug). Recently, we raised our FY issuance forecasts with the window of opportunity for issuers expected to extend post Labor Day (Credit Strategy Weekly Update). Our 2025 new- issue forecasts (HY \\$300bn/\\$90bn, \\$985bn/\\$190bn) incorporate a very active capital market backdrop in September and into October, that said we do expect softer growth and firmer inflation data to raise market volatility and constrain activity as we progress through 4Q. But with the slowdown in growth and rise in inflation indicators incorporated in our economists' forecast taking longer to materialize, we use this opportunity to adjust our YE25 HY/LL spread, yield, and full- year return targets. Specifically, revise lower our YE25 high- yield bond and leveraged loan spread forecasts to 375bp (from 450bp) and 475bp (from 550bp), respectively. For high- yield bonds, this translates into a yield of \\(7.5\\%\\) (+50bp versus now) and a FY25 total return of \\(7.5\\%\\) (or \\(1\\%\\) from now through YE25). This forecast incorporates a year- end 5- year Treasury yield of \\(3.65\\%\\) (- 5bp). For leveraged loans, this translates into a \\$- price of roughly \\$96.0 and FY25 total return of approximately \\(5.5\\%\\) (or \\(1.5\\%\\) from now through YE25). This forecast incorporates a year- end 3- month SOFR rate of \\(3.65\\%\\) (- 55bp). We still expect 50bp of spread widening as markets progress through 4Q as we do believe the full impact of tariffs on growth and inflation are yet to be fully reflected in business and consumer behavior. Despite a expected economic slowdown into early 1H26, we continue to believe leveraged credit spreads will remain inside their long- term average (25yr avg. HY/LL spread",

      "text": "In July 2025, \\(74.4bn of leveraged loans traded per LSTA which was up +1\\% m/m and up +16\\% yoy. Notably, July's volume follows June's\\) 73.7bn, May's \\(79.0bn and April's second highest monthly loan volume on record (\\$109.2bn). 2Q25 posted a record\\) 261.9bn of loans traded which compares to 1Q25's \\(254.2bn and a 10 - quarter average of\\) 205.3bn. YTD loan trading volume of \\(590.5bn is up +24\\% y/y and compares to\\) 477.1bn YTD24. For context, July has historically ranked as the fourth weakest trading month of the calendar year averaging \\(49.6bn since 2007. For reference, the most active trading months for loans in 2024 were October (\\$79.4bn), April (\\$72.5bn), and May (\\$72.5bn) with December and June (\\$62.7bn) the lightest. And loan trading volume averages\\) 84.4bn per month YTD compared to \\(68.5bn and\\) 59.6bn per month in 2024 and 2023, respectively. What is the monthly turnover rate for the leveraged loan asset class? We calculate the monthly turnover rate for leveraged loans in July as 4.90\\%, compared to a monthly average 4.77\\% in 2024 (or 57\\% per annum). How does this compare to high- yield bonds? We calculate the monthly turnover rate for high- yield bonds at 14.79\\% in July which follows 14.75\\% in June, and compares to an average monthly rate of 13.62\\% in 2024 (or 163\\% per annum). What accounts for the differential? A few reasons loans trade less than bonds include the holder base for leveraged loans (heavy CLO, bank participation) and the inability to short which limits hedge fund participation. Lastly, the median bid- ask spread in July was 50bp according to LSTA versus 53bp in 2024, 75bp in 2023, 84bp in 2022, 48bp in 2021, 120bp in 2020, 67bp in 2019, 53bp in 2018, and 51bp in 2017. In other words, in pricing environments where the \\% above Par is elevated (2021 and 2017/18) the bid- ask spread has tended to be narrower. Notably, July's BAS tightened 38bp since April's bid- ask spread (88bp) which was the widest since the regional banking crisis.",

We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used.",
