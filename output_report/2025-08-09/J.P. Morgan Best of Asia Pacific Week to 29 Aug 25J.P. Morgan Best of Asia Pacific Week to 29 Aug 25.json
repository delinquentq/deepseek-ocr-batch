      "text": "In the last week, the market has started to worry again about whether AI capex growth is likely to peak out in 2026, given elevated capex and some concerns resurfacing over (1) a lack of ROI from AI deployments and (2) the ability of companies to keep funding AI capex. Coupled with the lack of near- term upside from NVDA/ AMD's GPU shipments into China, we believe that investors are starting to take a more guarded approach on AI stocks in the near term. Our view is different: (1) We do not see any signs of excesses in the AI trade, the top 4 CSPs are still funding capex from their growing operating cashflows, and have ample ability to keep driving a growing capex budget well into 2027; (2) Large Private AI Labs and sovereigns are also joining the fray to keep driving AI investments (2) AI use- cases have proliferated substantially, especially in consumer AI (not so much in enterprise AI so far), with reasoning models adoption still at a fairly early stage (only 6 months in, since Deepseek R1 launch), resulting in very strong growth in token consumption. (4) China's capex growth has not even started in earnest, presenting another vector for demand growth. We believe that AI capex is poised to grow at least \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) in 2026, with the potential for further growth into 2027, as reasoning model adoption continues to grow and early signs of enterprise/ agentic AI workloads emerge through 2026- 27. Within AI, we continue to stay positive on core AI leaders (TSMC, SK Hynix, Hon Hai, Delta), while also seeing some new opportunities in substrates, OSAT (ASE), and in China AI buildout. Into 2026, the GOOG JPU foodchain appears poised for the strongest growth, followed by NVDA, AMD and AWS. Beyond AI, we are starting to see broader discussions on price hikes (BT substrates, T- Glass, some elements of ABE substrates, power management, legacy DRAM, high end OSAT etc), which may drive the next leg of tech EPS revisions.",

Re- rating in sector; remain selective on stocks The A- share semiconductor sector rallied by \\(13\\%\\) last week and outperformed the CSI300 index by \\(13\\%\\) in August. We attribute the rally to sentiment improvement with: (1) the debut of DeepSeek V3.1 model based on the new data format to support next generation local AI chip, (2) China Mobile unveiling the supplier list for its Rmb5bn AI server tender offer, and (3) stronger than expected WFE imports in July. While valuations in the sector are likely to re- rate, we prefer local AI, China WFE, and Apple supply chain with positive catalysts, but are more selective on Android smartphone component and IDM suppliers with demand/pricing uncertainty.",

Nio has seen a sharp share price rally lately (25% since beginning of Aug, vs MSCI China autos 6%), led by robust order flows from two new launches - Onvo L90 and Nio ES8 SUVs. Both are priced competitively, as Nio offers a unique BAAS (battery as a service) option that effectively lowers the purchase price by \\(\\sim 25 - 30\\%\\) , hence attractive vs comparable models in the same segment (Table 1).

Over the past three months, key sector issues have been shifting from uncertainty over tariffs to 1) the rising likelihood of tariff impact easing, 2) earnings improvement from lower environmental regulation costs, and 3) an increased likelihood of market share gains for Japanese autos. Under a \\(15\\%\\) auto tariff, we calculate the net tariff impact for major automakers such as Toyota and Honda will be only \\(8\\%\\) of FY2024 operating profit, and combined with a decline in compliance costs from recent regulatory easing, the net impact could be almost nil. A relaxation or elimination of environmental regulations could create a demand shift back from BEVs to HEVs and ICE vehicles and contribute to market share gains for Japanese autos. Toyota remains our top sector pick, and we upgrade Nissan from Underweight to Neutral.",
