We believe the Chinese and Korean governments' chemical rationalization efforts target the right goals, and while the impact on core earnings might take time to materialize, the direction is clear and might help the sector recover gradually over the next two years. We recommend buying higher- quality chemical names like LG Chem, Kumho, Hengli and PetroChina (all rated OW), while potentially revisiting lower- quality chemical names if more sustainable rationalization measures take root.",

This, coupled with limited capacity expansion has resulted in meaningful price hikes, increase in margin and earnings revisions for relevant equipment makers, and hence strong share performance (Figure 5). Apart from transformers and switchgears, we believe the tight supply of HVDC equipment is another key bottleneck in the ongoing energy transition. HVDC systems allow the efficient transmission of large amounts of power across long distances, which is essential to renewable development and cross- border electricity interconnection. While demand is surging globally, the Western market is dominated by three players (Hitachi, GE Vernova, Siemens Energy) and supply of key components is tight ( \\(\\sim 10\\) years of lead time for converter valves). Looking ahead, we believe Asian players have the potential to gain market share, given their plans for capacity expansion and development of local technology. Key names we would highlight are LS Electric, Hyosung Heavy, Nari Tech and Xuji.",

      "text": "We reiterate our UW rating on MDL as the risk- reward remains adverse despite the stock price correction. 4QFY25 and 1QFY26 results were very weak due to provisioning related to cost overruns. More importantly, the large order award for P- 75 Scorpene submarines (3 Nos) is yet to materialize and has been delayed versus earlier guidance. If these awards get delayed further, it would pose a risk to FY28 revenue estimates given it takes \\(\\sim 2\\) years for revenue to start being recognized. As of now, there appears to be little incremental positive news flow on the P- 75I (6 Nos) submarine award either. We think all of these negative factors will weigh on stock price performance in addition to existing concerns about the underlying margin structure. Longer- term, margins (as seen over the past few years) may not be sustainable, posing risks to medium- term earnings growth. Reiterate UW with reduced PT of Rs2468 (from Rs3027). We cut our FY26E/FY27E/FY28E EPS by \\(8\\% /11\\% /12\\%\\) .",

      "text": "In the last week, the market has started to worry again about whether Al capex growth is likely to peak out in 2026, given elevated capex and some concerns resurfacing over (1) a lack of ROI from Al deployments and (2) the ability of companies to keep funding Al capex. Coupled with the lack of near- term upside from NVDA/AMD's GPU shipments into China, we believe that investors are starting to take a more guarded approach on Al stocks in the near term. Our view is different: (1) We do not see any signs of excesses in the Al trade, the top 4 CSPs are still funding capex from their growing operating cashflows, and have ample ability to keep driving a growing capex budget well into 2027; (2) Large Private Al Labs and sovereigns are also joining the fray to keep driving Al investments (2) Al use- cases have proliferated substantially, especially in consumer Al (not so much inenterprise Al so far), with reasoning models adoption still at a fairly early stage (only 6 months in, since Deepseek R1 launch), resulting in very strong growth in token consumption. (4) China's capex growth has not even started in earnest, presenting another vector for demand growth. We believe that Al capex is poised to grow at least \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) in 2026, with the potential for further growth into 2027, as reasoning model adoption continues to grow and early signs of enterprise/ agentic Al workloads emerge through 2026- 27. Within Al, we continue to stay positive on core Al leaders (TSMC, SK Hynix, Hon Hai, Delta), while also seeing some new opportunities in substrates, OSAT (ASE), and in China Al buildout. Into 2026, the GOOG TPU foodchain appears poised for the strongest growth, followed by NVDA, AMD and AWS. Beyond Al, we are starting to see broader discussions on price hikes (BT substrates, T- Glass, some elements of ABF substrates, power management, legacy DRAM, high end OSAT etc), which may drive the next leg of tech EPS revisions.",

Key discussion points in this quarter's results were 1) realization of higher priced alumina inventory in 2Q hampered margin gains in the smelting business; 2) lower alumina prices significantly reduced associate contribution from Nanshan (associates down \\(45\\%\\) q/q and \\(17\\%\\) y/y), while Nanshan has completed its \\(3^{\\mathrm{rd}}\\) 1mtpa capacity expansion and 3) PMAH's smelting volume is back to optimum levels of \\(- 97\\%\\) utilization rate. While we believe the results are relatively in line with expectations, the 2H outlook for the business remains bright. We believe smelting EBIT margins will sequentially improve driven by 1) realization of lower alumina priced inventory; 2) slight sequential improvement in carbon anode prices and 3) better all- in aluminum prices that have been observable QTD (QTD LME aluminum at USD2,600/t vs 2Q25 average of USD2454/t). PMAH has also over provisioned for taxes in 1H25 with regards to GMT (global minimum taxes) and is guiding for \\(- 11\\%\\) tax rate in 2H25 (vs \\(12\\%\\) in 1H25). We remain positive on PMAH and see better earnings delivery in 2H25 driving the share price higher.",
