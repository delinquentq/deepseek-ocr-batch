Notwithstanding that, industrial activity has remained relatively subdued, with the quarterly annualized momentum (3m/3m, saar) at \\(2.2\\%\\) in July. The upside surprise was driven by a much lower contraction in mining activity than presaged by the \"core IP\" released earlier this month. On a year- on- year basis, IP printed at \\(3.5\\%\\) oya, higher than expectations (J.P. Morgan: \\(2.5\\%\\) ; Consensus: \\(2.2\\%\\) ) Within IP, manufacturing performed better, growing \\(2.3\\%\\) m/m, sa in July after a modest contraction in June, pulling up the quarterly annualized momentum. Most of this pick- up in manufacturing is ostensibly because of car production in the run up to the festive season. However, the announced GST cuts may push back consumer durable spending to when the cuts materialize. If that process goes beyond a few weeks, there is likely to be some near- term auto production - and hence manufacturing - softness. More fundamentally, with US tariffs rising to \\(25\\%\\) and then \\(50\\%\\) in August, exports are likely to come under some pressure with a knock- on impact on IP in the coming months.",

While this would normally be considered a significant headwind, the global policy easing and China liquidity surge currently underway is providing a strong counter force. In this context, we believe the equity bull market will remain intact and any correction/consolidation will present a buying opportunity. However, it is important to manage risks where positioning is particularly crowded. Looking across LO, HF and Quant investors, we note the highest crowding in Taiwan Tech/Semis and Indo Financials, followed by China Growth stocks (semis, consumer and biotech). Alongside this, ongoing support from monetary policy should eventually warrant a widening of the leadership and outperformance of Cyclicals. We are upgrading the Materials sector to Ow in the AxJ region following our recent allocation changes in India (see report). Within the AxJ region, our pecking order is Korea > India > China > Taiwan > ASEAN. Our key OwS are: China Tech, Internet, Healthcare, Materials, select Financial/Industrials; India Financials, Consumer ex Auto, Materials, Real Estate, Hospitals, select power/defense; Korea Financials, Tech, Holdco; TSMC in Taiwan; and ASEAN Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Healthcare, IT.",

The event is organised by India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) which has outlayed Rs760bn to develop a semiconductor ecosystem in India across semiconductor fabs, display fabs, OSAT and design. The Indian government has already approved 10 semiconductor plants so far with cumulative investments of Rs1600bn of which one plant is of Kaynes where it will be investing Rs33bn. We will watch out for: 1) any potential announcement by the government around expanding the Rs760bn initial outlay given increased interest from companies in setting up semiconductor plants, and 2) any potential announcement by Kaynes on either offtake agreements or technology partnership on OSAT.",

Recent entry- level plan changes are steps in the right direction but won't have a material impact on ARPU on their own. Mgmt views Homes as a significant multi- year opportunity as a combination of fiber and FWA where Airtel's business can more than double should 100m households take this. The co's incremental focus areas for capital deployment are deleveraging, dividend increases, capex towards cloud and data centres and balance sheet leverage in digital lending.
