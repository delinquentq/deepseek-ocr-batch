The company did not disclose the trend on retail AQ, where peers are seeing rising pressure. On the negative side, BoBJ's 1H25 NIM contraction (- 16bps h/h) is larger than expected, and the trend is worse than CRB peers (- 6bps h/h for covered CBRs on average). In addition, its CET1 ratio was only 84bps above the regulatory minimum requirement, which may restrict the stability of its dividend policies. No interim dividend in 1H25 is disappointing to yield investors. We expect a muted to slightly negative market reaction given the capital pressure and lagging NIM trend. Maintain Neutral.",
