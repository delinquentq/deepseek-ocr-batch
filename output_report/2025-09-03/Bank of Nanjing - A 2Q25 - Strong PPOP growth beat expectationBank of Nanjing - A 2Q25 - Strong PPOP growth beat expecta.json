Strong PPOP growth was driven by robust NII growth (+27%y/y), milder-than- expected non- fee contraction (- 3% y/y) and improvement in cost efficiency, while the fee income came in slightly below our estimation. In addition, we like BoNB's stable asset quality and improved capital positions in the 2Q result. However, more significant h/h NIM contraction in 1H25 (- 6bps h/h) vs 2H24 (- 4bps h/h) might disappoint some investors. On net, this is a strong result, and we expect a positive share price reaction.",

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.",
