His comments suggested that employment would be more important than inflation, with the heads of the BoJ, ECB & BoE highlighting the challenge to economic growth posed by low birth rates (UK fertility rate is now 1.41 vs. a replacement rate of 2.1 - ONS) and ageing populations in the world's largest economies. With this posing a threat to productivity and prices thus the need for increased foreign workers to boost growth and maintain price stability.",

This leads to lower savings, increased government benefits spending, and affects the labour force, which might lead to slow growth and possibly deflation. \"Demography is destiny\" was coined by Auguste Comte (1798- 1857), who argued that the size and composition of a population determines a country's future.",

The business has expanded to 7.5k sqft & following acquisition by Unilever & will double its footprint to 14k sqft, moving into WKP's HQ at Kennington Park, with WKP moving to The Centro Buildings, NW1.

According to the Sunday Telegraph on 24 August 2025, some economists believe that the UK could be heading towards a debt crisis reminiscent of 1976, when the UK had a secondary banking crisis and office yields expanded from 5% to 8% (1973- 75, right), and potentially another IMF bailout. However, HM Treasury points to a credible fiscal strategy, a plan for economic growth and positive fiscal rules that have helped cut rates, and the IMF recently upgraded its economic forecast for the UK to the third fastest- growing economy in the G7. The cause for concern is that office yields trade in a long- term channel of 5- 9% (ignoring the 1990s property crash, with recessions in grey) and are pegged at their cyclical low yield/high rental expectation levels.",
