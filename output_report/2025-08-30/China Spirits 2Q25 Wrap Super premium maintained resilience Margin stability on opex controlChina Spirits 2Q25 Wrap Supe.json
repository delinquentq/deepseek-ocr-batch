      "text": "By Aug 29 after market close, all of our covered spirits companies had reported 2Q25 results. Overall, this round of results mostly trailed our expectation (highlighted in our 2Q25 preview) due to anti- extravagance policy impact. In line with our early- July spirits deep- dive, super- premium proved relatively resilient: Moutai/Wuliangye delivered in- line sales, and Laojiao came in better- than- feared (2Q25 sales/NP declined by \\(8\\% /11\\%\\) yoy, both above GSe at \\(- 17\\% / - 23\\%\\) ). Within upper- mid- end, Fen Wine managed to record in- line flattish sales (with help of low- end segment), whereas other upper mid end peers prioritized channel health via broad adjustments, resulting in major misses/significant topline/NP decline at Yanghe/King's Luck/ZJLD/Swellfun/Jiugui/Guijing (2Q25 sales/NP declined by \\(14\\% /12\\%\\) yoy, both below GSe at \\(0\\% / - 2\\%\\) ). The key highlights underscores 1) better than feared margin resilience despite of ASP decline /mix shift across brands likely on stringent expense control; 2) Deteriorating operating cash flow especially for upper- mid- end names; 3) mixed customer advances balance in 2Q end and we haven't seen significant customer advances plummet yoy in 2Q in most names except for Gujing/Jiugui.",

Moutai recorded the strongest sales growth across our coverage at 9% yoy in 2Q25; Wuliangye and Fen Wine were flattish; Laojiao declined a mild 8% yoy; other names fell 14% - 57% yoy. In terms of product mix, Moutai/Wuliangye's high-end segment outperformed their less high-end series spirits segment, while Fen Wine/Laojiao's more resilient topline vs. other upper-mid end spirits likely benefits from their diversified product portfolio, esp. with robust position in mid-to-low-end pricing segment (e.g. Bo Fen/Touqu). Gujing leveraged its market share gain capability to drive a more resilient performance for Nianfen Yuanjiang series (up 2% in 1H25) with help from low-end (Huanghelou up 7% in 1H25). In terms of volume vs. ASP, generally we saw more resilient volume with cost of ASP decline for more premium brands (ie. in 1H25, Wuliangye Spirits volume up 12.7%/ASP down - 7.2% yoy; Laojiao mid-to-high spirits volume up 13%/ASP down - 14%; Gujing Nianfen Yuanjiang volume up 11%/ASP down 9%).",

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
