      "text": "On Saturday 8/30, MLYS's competitor AZN presented results from baxdrostat's pivotal Ph. 3 BaxHTN study in \\(3L+\\) uHTN/HTN patients on two background anti- hypertensive therapies (including one diuretic), which were simultaneously published in NEJM. Although BaxHTN met its primary endpoint for 1- 2 mg QD doses, its placebo- adjusted SBP reduction and confirmed hyperkalemia \\(>6.0\\) mmol/L were numerically worse than lourndrostat's Launch- HTN results (Exhibit 1). After 12 weeks, baxdrostat's placebo- adjusted SBP reductions were 9.8 mmHg (15.7 mmHg absolute) for 2 mg QD and 8.7 mmHg (14.5 mmHg absolute) for 1 mg QD. By comparison, recall that lourndrostat showed an impressive 11.7 mmHg placebo- adjusted SBP reduction (19.0 mmHg absolute) at week 12 for the 50 mg dose in Launch- HTN. Baxdrostat's incidence of confirmed hyperkalemia \\(>6.0\\) mmol/L was \\(1.1\\%\\) for 1- 2 mg doses and higher than lourndrostat's \\(0.6\\%\\) incidence in Launch- HTN. While confirmed measurements were not reported for other thresholds, baxdrostat's single measurement of hyperkalemia for \\(K+ > 5.5\\) and \\(>6.0\\) mmol/L for 1- 2 mg QD doses were \\(- 6 - 11\\%\\) and \\(- 2 - 3\\%\\) , respectively (vs. \\(8.2\\%\\) \\(>5.5\\) mmol/L and \\(1.1\\%\\) \\(>6.0\\) mmol/L for lourndrostat 50 mg QD). Baxdrostat's \\(K+ > 6.5\\) mmol/L was \\(1.9\\%\\) for 1 mg and \\(0.4\\%\\) for 2 mg. Both were higher than lourndrostat's \\(0.2\\%\\) incidence (0% based on repeat measure) for 50 mg QD. Overall, we believe BaxHTN's results underperformed and Launch- HTN's \\(\\sim 2\\) mmHg higher reduction is considered clinically meaningful according to KOLs we consulted. The results were also consistent with our strong conviction that Launch- HTN's efficacy was a high bar and difficult to beat/match. While we acknowledge typical limitations in cross- trial comparisons, we believe lourndrostat's numerically/meaningfully greater SBP reduction with favorable safety supports a best- in- class profile and could give MLYS commercial/promotional advantages. We will further discuss BaxHTN's implications in our dinner NDR with MLYS mgmt + its KOL (Dr. Manish Saxena) on Sunday, 8/31.",

Per Endpoints news, AZN plans to submit baxdrostat's NDA by YE25, which would come before lorundrostat's expected NDA filing since MLYS has not yet guided (we expect early 2026). However, this timeline was not mentioned in AZN's PR. AZN confirmed it will share results from its Ph. 3 Bax24 study in 2H25, although we view the read- through from this study as less relevant and not comparable to MLYS's studies.",

Placebo- adjusted SBP reduction for zilebesiran \\(300mg\\) Q6M was only slightly statistically significant at 3 months (- 5.0 mmHg; \\(\\mathsf{p} = 0.0431\\) ). However, the higher \\(600mg\\) Q6M dose (- 3.3 mmHg; \\(\\mathsf{p} = 0.1830\\) ) failed to meet statistical significance. Overall, these results are not surprising since - 83- 84% of patients were already on background ACEi/ARB therapy where zilebesiran's mechanism was redundant in targeting the RAAS pathway. A post- hoc analysis of patients on diuretics w/ baseline SBP \\(>140mmHg\\) revealed higher placebo- adjusted SBP reduction of 9.2 mmHg at 3 months. However, given KARDIA- 3's underwhelming results and zilebesiran's overlapping mechanism, we continue to struggle in finding an apparent place for zilebesiran in the treatment algorithm since ACEi/ARBs are highly preferred generics in prescribers' armamentarium and payers' formularies. In our view, replacing ACEi/ARB in 1L or as a backbone therapy in subsequent lines is not realistic. Adding zilebesiran on ACEi/ARB seems redundant.",
