Management also indicated that they are cautiously optimistic on the scale up opportunity for ethernet. While ANET has not quantified this opportunity, they see potential for it to be meaningful in 2027 (especially if there is more compute silicon diversity).

Cloud titans and other compute vendors are developing custom silicon and prefer to use a non- proprietary solution for scale- up. The company currently does not have an announced product related to scale up ethernet and does not expect the opportunity to be meaningful until 2027 at the earliest (IB was once the standard for scale out and that has shifted to ethernet; there is potential for a similar dynamic to occur within scale up). Tomahawk 6 might be a good option for non- NVLink scale up as well - ANET indicated that there are limited sales related to T6 but expects shipments to occur in H2:26 and for revenue to potentially ramp in 2027. Worth noting that cloud titan customers have not made the decision on scale up ethernet vs. other solutions such as UALink.",

Specifically, STX is leaning into its leadership in HAMR technology, having already qualified three major cloud customers and expecting to qualify all top seven by next summer. Demand in the cloud segment remains strong with visibility extending 3- 4 quarters through BTO, while constrained supply ensures everything produced is sold, even as some demand shifts forward into future quarters. Margins are expected to expand with favorable mix and scale as HAMR adoption accelerates, while cost discipline, streamlined R&D, and a stable balance sheet support the company's commitment to returning \\(75\\%\\) of FCF to shareholders.

Notably, the HDD market is structurally different from previous cycles and showing better pricing than the \\(\\sim 7\\%\\) ASP base case decline outlined at their Investor Day. Not only has capacity tightened (\\~50M units vs. \\(\\sim 80M\\) during the peak), but the market is also shifting to EB- based terms. WDC also provided an update on HAMR, and that areal density development is ahead of plan. Though it's worth noting, that the company is also expanding their UltraSMR products - which provides \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) capacity uplift at no incremental cost. WDC expects UltraSMR to make up \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) of nearline by end- CY25, which should be margin accretive—though there may be some variability sequentially due to customer implementation and timing. Longer term, HDD growth is expected to remain favorable as they remain essential for cloud storage (\\~85% of data) alongside SSDs in tiered AI/inferencing architectures.
