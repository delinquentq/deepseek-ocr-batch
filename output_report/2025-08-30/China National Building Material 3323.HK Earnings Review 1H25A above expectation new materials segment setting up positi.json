CNBM's new materials operation, with glass fibre subsegment that related to China's energy transition, advance manufacturing, data centers, etc, are building track record in delivering more visible growth through a diversified product portfolio in our view, amid continued cyclical challenge including capacity imbalance. For cement, we expect near- term domestic cement margins to remain depressed, but we see improving visibility in execution of the industry control on unauthorized capacity in 2026E. We expect the cement margin improvement for CNBM is more moderate versus its major peers, due to less favorable exposures to most benefited regions. Maintain Buy with a revised 12- month target price of HK\\(6.7/shr (from HK\\)4.4/sh), implying 8.1x P/E of 2026E, versus a range of 4- 15x in past years.",

CNBM's new materials operation, with glass fibre subsegment that related to China's energy transition, advance manufacturing, data centers, etc, are building track record in delivering more visible growth through a diversified product portfolio in our view, amid continued cyclical challenge including capacity imbalance. For cement, we expect near- term domestic cement margins to remain depressed, but we see improving visibility in execution of the industry control on unauthorized capacity in 2026E. We expect the cement margin improvement for CNBM is more moderate versus its major peers, due to less favorable exposures to most benefited regions.
