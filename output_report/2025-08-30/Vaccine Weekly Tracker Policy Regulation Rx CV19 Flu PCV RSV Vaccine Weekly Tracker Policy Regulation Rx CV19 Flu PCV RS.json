As the vaccine space evolves on the policy/regulation side under new leadership, we provide our thoughts on recent landscape updates and watch for key upcoming catalysts Chart 1. This week brought unprecedented CDC turmoil with the leadership ouster of Senate- confirmed director amplifying a feeling of uncertainty ahead of the CV19 season. The CV19 BLA approvals for all vaccines (PFE/BNTX, MRNA, NVAX/SNY) gave assurance, but the upcoming Sept 18- 19 vote remains key hurdle for insurance coverage and pharmacy access. Rising CV19 wastewater levels and XFG sub- variant activity show a predicted seasonality pattern for CV19 with antigenic drift (and not complete lineage shift), favoring NVAX.",

Following an announcement on HHS's X account, Dr. Monarez's legal team stated she had neither resigned nor received notification from White House (stating only President Trump, who appointed her, could fire her) that she has been fired. RFK Jr emailed CDC employees appointing Jim O'Neill, HHS deputy w/ no medical credentials and prev anti-vaccine statements, as Acting Director. Dr. Monarez's removal triggered resignations of other senior officials (Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis, Daniel Jernigan) and a staff walkout at CDC HQ. This introduces governance instability and raises concerns about scientific independence.",
