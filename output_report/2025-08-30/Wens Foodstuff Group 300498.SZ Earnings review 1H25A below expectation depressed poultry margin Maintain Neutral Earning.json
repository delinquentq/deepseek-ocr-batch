We expect improving supply/demand fundamentals in China domestic hog market for 2026E, driven by potential improving industry supply discipline, related to control in sow herd, output weight and secondary fattening, amid demand likely to remain soft. Wen's increasing effort in cost cutting, through breeding development, more effective disease control, and optimizing feed formulation, is also expected to support unit profit in hog operations in 2026E. While yellow- feather broiler margin is depressed, we expect improvements in 2026E, as supply response from farmers emerges based on producer's feedback. Current share price implies 11x P/E on 2026E, versus its historical range of 10- 20x, fair in our view. Maintain Neutral with a revised 12- m target price of Rmb19.0/sh (from Rmb17.0/sh).",

We expect improving supply/demand fundamentals in China domestic hog market for 2026E, driven by potential improving industry supply discipline, related to control in sow herd, output weight and secondary fattening, amid demand likely to remain soft. Wen's increasing effort in cost cutting, through breeding development, more effective disease control, and optimizing feed formulation, is also expected to support unit profit in hog operation in 2026E. While yellow- feather broiler margin is depressed, we expect improvements in 2026E, as supply response from farmers emerges based on producer's feedback. We are Neutral rated on Wens as we believe its current valuation fairly reflected its earning growth outlook in poultry and hog segment.",

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
