      "text": "This past week was relatively quiet in the sector, although investor attendance on our bi- weekly Digging Deeper global call was surprisingly high given the time of the year. Sector fundamentals are likely to change as a Fed rate cut cycle presumably begins. The combination of rate cuts, relatively tame inflation and a resilient economy should be positive for mining and steel share prices. However, the key to this conclusion is that the economy does not materially slow. A sharp slowdown in growth would be an obvious negative, but that is clearly not the consensus view. Could we be entering a Goldilocks economy? And if we are, does it mean that big cap tech stocks just continue to outperform as mining and steel get left further in the dust? Or is this finally our time to shine?",
