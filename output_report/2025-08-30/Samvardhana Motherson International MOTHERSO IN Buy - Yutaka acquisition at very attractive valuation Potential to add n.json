Assuming flat revenue and EBITDA growth for FY27F, the acquisition is valued at \\(\\sim 4x\\) FY27F P/E (Fig. 2). Based on our estimates, we expect EPS accretion of \\(\\sim 3\\%\\) in the first year itself. We believe Yutaka Giken, being a Honda group company, is likely to grow in- line with Honda for the next- 1- 2 years, with further potential upside from its ability to add new customers once Honda becomes a minority shareholder. Moreover, the acquisition will enhance SAMIL's product portfolio in EV components, such as motor assemblies, rotors and thermal systems. Key risks include continued decline in Honda's volumes, which could pose a risk to Yutaka's earnings.",
