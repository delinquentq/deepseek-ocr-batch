      "text": "Happy Labor Day weekend! So just a few thoughts on software as we close up the summer, and we also provide a few thoughts into HUBS' analyst day next week. While it was a rough August in software, the reaction to strong results from SNOW and MDB (not covered) provides a bit of a tailwind for the software bull case as we head into the fall. While the 'AI eats software' narrative is an effective short thesis when there is no 'beat/raise' momentum in the space or estimates are not going up, what SNOW and MDB illustrated is that reacceleration stories in software can drag investors off the sidelines. This aligns with other YTD winners like MSFT or ORCL where acceleration in Azure and OCI has helped drive shares higher. Essentially, software is a huge space so applying a blanket short narrative for the entire sector does not make a ton of sense and the infra names are clearly seeing more benefits from AI vs. apps at this point. Along those lines, CRM earnings on Weds night will be an interesting litmus test for the apps names as expectations are low and the valuation is arguably washed out. However, with Dreamforce on the horizon and the potential for revenue to reaccelerate in 2H (more likely F4Q), if CRM shares can hang in at these levels following 'slight beat/keep' F2Q results, that could signal the start of a move back into select apps names or at least the start of a more tradable bottom. It's worth noting WDAY is up relative to where it was on T+1 post F2Q EPS.",

      "text": "Bottom line: We would caution in terms of over extrapolating SNOW/MDB's results relative to the rest of software, but their T+1 moves speak to: 1) investors will reward clean beat/raise results; 2) revenue reacceleration = multiple expansion and this is still a possibility of 2H reacceleration for CRM, HUBS, and WDAY; and 3) the apathy towards software can shift quickly and if money flow returns to the space, there could be some material upside for select names in C4Q. Enjoy the long weekend!",

While the 'up to \\(5\\%\\) price hike is expected to start impacting the financials in a more meaningful way in F4Q (as a larger portion of customers that have been migrated will be up for renewal), we expect the more interesting topic as it relates to potential revenue acceleration will involve any color in terms of consumption revenue contribution from these Agents as well as data enrichment via Breeze Intelligence as customers look to unify their data more holistically in the Gen Al world. Worth noting also that we expect that the company will address 'head on' the recent bear thesis of 'SaaS is dead' that has weighed on horizontal application software YTD - interesting post on the topic from Founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah a couple weeks ago.",

We continue to believe that this is a distinct possibility given the 1H constant currency outperformance ( \\(\\sim 300\\) bps in 1Q, \\(\\sim 200\\) bps in 2Q) coupled with the fact that compares continue to ease in the 2H, despite the fact that the current guidance of \\(\\sim 17\\%\\) implies a couple points of 2H deceleration.",
