It is proceeding on an expedited schedule, and the Court is likely to use its emergency docket to stay the tariffs while deliberating. If the Supreme Court ultimately rules against the use of IEEPA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) could issue refunds for tariffs already paid, as it has done in past Section 232 cases. In this case, importers must proactively preserve their right to refunds. This includes monitoring liquidation dates and submitting protests within the 180-day window. Failure to do so could forfeit refund eligibility (see here). Trade agreements tied to reciprocal tariffs—many of which are informal—may also be at risk and could require renegotiation.",

However, short- term uncertainty may rise as some trade agreements may need to be renegotiated. Additionally, because these tariffs are expected to generate fiscal revenue, a ruling against them could reignite questions around U.S. fiscal sustainability. Investors should monitor the legal trajectory and the pace of new tariff investigations. Sector- specific exposure and mitigation strategies (e.g., Chapter 98 exemptions) will be increasingly important.",
