Farasis's pouch battery route makes it vulnerable in oversupplied conditions, when the majority of domestic peers deploy more economical prismatic routes. 2. Against the CAPEX cut trend of China's battery sector, Farasis is still on track to add domestic capacity. We worry that Farasis' new domestic capacity in Guangzhou and Ganzhou (30GWh each) are likely to generate higher fixed costs that we believe are unlikely to be justified by volume growth. As such, the company's exposure to the domestic market is set to increase from \\(\\sim 23\\%\\) in 2024 to \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) in 2026, which would lead to further unit GP pressure. Therefore, we see Farasis's unit GP as likely be capped at around \\(\\sim\\) Rmb80/kWh in our forecast years, leading to net losses in 2025E- 2027E.",

While we expect the company to benefit from the tailwinds of ex- China demand growth, we expect its gross profit margin to be below the industry average because of the high costs of pouch battery materials. Farasis has strengthened partnerships with key customers including Mercedes- Benz and GAC via shareholding arrangements. We are concerned that Farasis' new domestic capacity in Guangzhou and Ganzhou (30GWh each) are likely to generate higher fixed costs that we believe are unlikely to be justified by volume growth. As such, the company's exposure to the domestic market is set to increase from \\(\\sim 23\\%\\) in 2024 to \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) in 2026E, which would lead to further unit GP pressure. Therefore, we see Farasis's unit GP to likely be capped at \\(\\sim \\mathsf{Rmb80 / kWh}\\) in our forecast years, leading to net losses in 2025E- 2026E. We are Sell rated on the stock given relatively limited risk- reward vs. our coverage.",
