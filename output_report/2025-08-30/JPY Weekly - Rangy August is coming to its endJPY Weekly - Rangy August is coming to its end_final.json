Headed into its August print next Friday, we stay short USD/JPY, as we maintain our view that the pair's risk is skewed to the downside. The likelihood of an early LDP leadership election has likely eased, owing to the party election committee's decision on voting process. However, Secretary General Moriyama's resignation could trigger an early election, and the situation remains fluid. The OIS market's pricing for the BOJ's rate hike by this year-end has not changed around 16- 17bp, while BOJspeak has not downplayed that pricing this week, likely owing to Japan's inflationary pressure being resilient. JPY week ahead: US nonfarm payrolls is the key focus next week. The LDP is scheduled to hold a general assembly to review the Upper House election outcome and then, the opinion- gathering process on an early leadership election will commence. BOJ Deputy Governor Himino is scheduled to speak.",

However, services PPI data (for July) were not as weak as the headline figure indicated, as PPI for services with a high labor cost ratio remained resilient. Moreover, in the Tokyo CPI report (for August), services CPI inflation remained steady around 2% annual increase (Fig. 6), and this supports the BOJ's view that Japanese companies' price and wage setting behavior are changing.",

As a rule, JGBs for individual investors may not be sold in the first 12 months after issuance. When JGBs for individual investors are sold before maturity, an amount calculated via the following formula will be subtracted from the par value of the bond plus accrued interest: (1) for 10- year variable rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) \\(\\times 0.79685\\) will be used, (2) for 5- year and 3- year fixed rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) \\(\\times 0.79685\\) will be used. When inflation- indexed JGBs are purchased via public offerings, secondary distributions (uridashi deals), or other OTC transactions with Nomura Securities, only the purchase price shall be paid, with no sales commission charged. Inflation- indexed JGBs carry the risk of losses, as prices fluctuate in line with changes in market interest rates and fluctuations in the nationwide consumer price index. The notional principal of inflation- indexed JGBs changes in line with the rate of change in nationwide CPI inflation from the time of its issuance. The amount of the coupon payment is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate by the notional principal at the time of payment. The maturity value is the amount of the notional principal when the issue becomes due. For J117 and subsequent issues, the maturity value shall not undercut the face amount. Purchases of investment trusts (and sales of some investment trusts) are subject to a purchase or sales fee of up to \\(5.5\\%\\) (tax included) of the transaction amount. Also, a direct cost that may be incurred when selling investment trusts is a fee of up to \\(2.0\\%\\) of the unit price at the time of redemption. Indirect costs that may be incurred during the course of holding investment trusts include, for domestic investment trusts, an asset management fee (trust fee) of up to \\(5.5\\%\\) (tax included/annualized basis) of the net assets in trust, as well as fees based on investment performance. Other indirect costs may also be incurred. For foreign investment trusts, indirect fees may be incurred during the course of holding such as investment company compensation.",
