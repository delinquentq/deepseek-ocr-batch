BABA indicated that its QC daily average order volume reached 80mn in August, with beverage- related orders accounting for less than \\(30\\%\\) of the total. We estimate Meituan's daily average orders in August was over 90mn. Hence, the gap between the two had narrowed significantly in the past three months. BABA conceded its QC was in big loss - in the June quarter, the EBITA of its newly- created China ecommerce group (CEG, including Taobao, quick commerce and travel service) dropped \\(21\\%\\) or CNY10bn, which was mainly caused by the QC investment of around CNY11bn in the quarter. Further, BABA suggested that the loss in the September quarter is likely to peak at CNY22bn due to heavy upfront investment this quarter in growing delivery forces, users mind share and order volume. BABA expects its loss per order to narrow by \\(50\\%\\) within the next two months backed by optimized operating efficiency and scale economy.",

QC has contributed to a solid \\(25\\%\\) y- y in monthly active buyers on its flagship Taobao app in the first three weeks of August, according to BABA, which in turn lends support to the growth of its CMR (customer management revenue) and potential savings on the marketing dollars.",

We believe this bullish guidance for CMR outlook is a positive surprise - ahead of the 2Q print, the market had penciled in slowing CMR growth in the coming two quarters due to high base effect.",
