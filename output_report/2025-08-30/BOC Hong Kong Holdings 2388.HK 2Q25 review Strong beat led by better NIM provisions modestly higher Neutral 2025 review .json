Mgmt declared 2Q DPS of HK\\\\$0.29, same as 1Q and hence 1H25 DPS was HK\\\\$0.58, in- line with GSe, but \\(- 13\\%\\) below consensus. The grp CET 1 CAR was \\(23.69\\%\\) , 1pp above both consensus and GSe.

All in, we would expect a positive share price reaction to the results as NII was a positive surprise, despite credit cost was modestly higher. After factoring in the 2Q beat, we change FY25/26/27E EPS by \\(+10\\% / + 9\\% / + 11\\%\\) , reflecting upward revisions in NIM forecasts and non- interest income, partially offset by higher provision charges. We continue to expect the grp to raise DPO by 1pp from \\(55\\%\\) in FY24 to \\(56\\%\\) in FY25E and step up to \\(58\\% /60\\%\\) in FY26/27E (unchanged). Our 12m RIM- based target price is raised by \\(+9\\%\\) to HK\\\\$38.3 from HK\\\\$35.1.
