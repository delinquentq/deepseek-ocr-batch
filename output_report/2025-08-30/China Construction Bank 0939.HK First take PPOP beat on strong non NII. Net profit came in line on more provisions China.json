The interim dividend payout ratio came in at \\(30\\%\\) , implying DPS yoy of - \\(6\\%\\) , with inclusion of the dilution impact from capital raising. We expect investors' focus would be on: 1) the outlook of non NII given the beat, 2) asset quality trend, due to the more than expected provisions, 3) capital return given the strong capital base and PPOP growth.",
