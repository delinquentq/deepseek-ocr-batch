      "text": "Japanese stocks rose sharply in August, and both the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX set record highs for the first time in a year. Some market participants are skeptical that this rise is sustainable given Japan's political instability and weak corporate earnings in the Apr- Jun quarter, but our view is different. As expectations for when the Fed/BOJ will cut/hike interest rates are brought forward, we believe Japanese stocks are appreciating in response to the market view that yen appreciation will remain moderate from the perspective of supply/demand conditions accompanying large- scale investments by Japanese corporations in the US. Japanese corporate earnings were weak in the Apr- Jun quarter, but management comments on tariff impact and countermeasures going forward point to less tariff impact than the market is pricing in, and we expect both corporate earnings guidance and consensus forecasts to switch direction and start rising. In Japanese politics, we think a change of administration is still the most likely outcome despite the Cabinet support rate's rally, and if the new administration has a majority in the Lower House, we believe political stabilization will be positive for the stock market. Our core strategy recommendations remain domestic demand and banks given the prospects we see for only gradual yen appreciation and for domestic economic recovery.",

We think one contributing factor was uncertain growth potential as many companies reported weak overseas sales in April- June. July data showed continued firm production and shipments for daily necessities with some exceptions, but continued weak shipments for cosmetics aside from UV care products. Cosmetics imports resumed a decline in July, but we think this alone does not suggest an easing of competition in the cosmetics market. Rather, we think competition could intensify due to a series of new product releases and major product renewals by domestic and overseas high- prestige brands in September.",
