From the briefing, we see positives including: 1) solid orders into 3Q and a reversion to positive growth in export sales in 4Q lapping an easy base; currently the company sees full capacity in its Vietnam factory and \\(80\\% - 90\\%\\) UTR in its Cambodia factory. Management also mentioned more resilience from clients like Walmart in passing on tariff costs, while non- US orders have not been affected given product differentiation. 2) management believes the New Zealand factory is on track to deliver \\(10\\%\\) UTR in 2025 and \\(30\\%\\) in 2026/2027, and move to full UTR by 2028 with \\(80\\%\\) of total capacity targeting overseas clients and benefits from automation. Management also pointed out the key challenge of requiring a longer time to build new clients, although with higher loyalty. 3) Meatway is still showing strong growth momentum on continuous new product launches and fast growth in existing air- dried staples food. Into 2H, Meatway will shift its focus toward staple foods, and plans to introduce freeze- dried and high- end snacks. Management highlighted Meatway's potential to reach sales of Rmb2bn in the long term.",
