      "text": "- The Luxury sector remains highly topical following our bullish push on 20 Aug and a competitor upgrading a couple of stocks in the space today.- Over the last week, we have seen both LO and HF buying of Luxury on the single stock desk (LVMH, Kering, Hermes, Moncler, Brunello) as fundamental investors looked to play 1) better US data; 2) Q3 consensus numbers which look intact. In addition, we've seen some decent buying of our basket (GSXELUXG) which, feedback suggests, is more about the China trade. Following the largest ever monthly net buying of China equities in our prime book (in notional terms, with a +3 sigma move vs the last 10 years), HF gross allocation to China is approaching 2 yr highs and macro funds are looking for a 2nd derivative China trade.- My view remains unchanged in terms of end-demand trends in this sector. I have good conviction that the US is tracking ahead of expectations for Q3, supported by broad-based data showing an improvement in discretionary spending here. However, the picture in Asia is more complicated - there's lots of noise around ML China improving sequentially (Louise flagged that China handbag imports turned positive in July for the first time in 18m) but this should be seen in the context of repatriation from Japan and much easier comps. I note that consensus already assumes an improvement in China given the comp base.",

However, Isetan Mitsukoshi told us that duty free sales are still weak here due to a narrowing price gap vs ML China on Luxury Goods. Meanwhile in Macau, GGR was strong in August (+12%) but I would caution that 1) Louise's macro tracker finds only a 0.14 correlation between this data set and regional Luxury sales growth; 2) VIP GGR is still tracking 30- 40% below pre- pandemic levels - it's mass- market GGR that has recovered (to 125- 130%). Overall, I would be surprised if there is a true underlying improvement in China cluster (at home and abroad) spending in Q3.",

Expect Pandora to sound more constructive on current trading than they did at the Q2 stage, citing initial consumer response to the Talisman collection launch (and given we are now past the particularly challenging July comp). For Burberry, while feedback has been data has looked less good for them recently, we assume the message tomorrow will be fairly confident, highlighting success of summer campaign such as Burberry bikini and the festival capsules. More broadly, we expect the event (which includes 70 local US retailers) to confirm an improved discretionary spending backdrop in the US; 2) Milan/Paris Fashion Weeks from 23 Sept with a number of new creatives presenting for the first time (Blazy at Chanel, Anderson at Dior, Demna at Gucci), potentially bringing much needed consumer excitement back to this category; 3) Last week of September – pre-close calls which, based on the above, we think will underpin consensus expectations.",

For a reminder of debates in credit markets on Kering, please click here. Note, in mid- August, S&P changed it's outlook on Kering to \"negative\" and CDS has widened further (+40bps since start of June), now at 125bps.
