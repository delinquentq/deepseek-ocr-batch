Despite operating software & consumer services functionality for over a decade, we believe Porch's more recent prioritization of Insurance will make this the leading growth and profitability driver for the business going forward.

This structure limits Porch's direct exposure to underwriting risk vs. directly owning the reciprocal insurance entity, which is important given concentrated exposure to heavy CAT loss markets like Texas, while also separating balance sheet requirements (i.e., Surplus build) from Porch. Over time, this should allow management more optionality with utilizing Porch cash.",

While we believe it is too early to definitively link Home Factors to better underwriting results, Porch's improving gross and attritional loss ratios over the past three years (see Exhibit 20), which have generally been below the Top-15 carrier average post-2021, are encouraging. We expect to learn a lot more about Porch's underwriting ability through monitoring loss ratios as the reciprocal scales over time.

The reciprocal has limited its exposure to Surplus risk through more significant reinsurance contracts that went into effect on 4/1/2025, but we would note that Porch also still carries some risk through its captive reinsurance business that would be negatively impacted should loss ratios revert higher.

Management's focus on increasing agency distribution, combined with competitive underwriting capabilities leveraging Porch's \"Home Factors\" data, should incentivize agents to sell Porch Insurance and provide competitive- cost access to homebuyers that drives upside risk to revenue growth estimates. Additionally, management possesses multiple levers for sustained revenue growth, including the potential for take- rate increases and favorable quota- share adjustments in the future. The segment's robust 1H25 outperformance and current surplus position support near- to- medium term growth targets, which is critical given we expect the insurance segment to drive the vast majority of revenue & EBITDA over time. While upside magnitude is challenging to quantify and largely dependent on the level of investment / pace of distribution Porch chooses to make in agency relationship expansion, we ultimately believe the Porch's growth optionality creates a favorable setup over the near- to- medium term.",

Homeowners insurers synthesize multiple data streams to assess risk including 1) property attributes (age, construction materials such as wood vs. brick, roof type—e.g., hip roofs can better withstand hurricane winds), 2) geographic exposures (catastrophe propensity like flood or wildfire, and proximity to emergency services), and 3) personal and claims history (including credit and prior losses), among others. Carriers source this from public records and third- party vendors such as LexisNexis for claims history via the CLUE database and Verisk Analytics for property data and telematics. While applicant and geographical data (including geospatial data) and analytics is foundational and widely available to insurers, granular property- level interior and exterior data has been scarce and expensive to obtain. Through its access to detailed property data from inspection reports (which is back- tested against \\(\\sim 15\\) years of HOAs historical claims data), the company has developed a proprietary Home Factors data model which claims to sharpen risk segmentation (between low- risk vs. high- risk homes) on the basis of more than 50 property- specific signals (for example, roof condition, electrical panel capacity, and piping), improving underwriting accuracy and creating a price differential for end consumers with lower- risk homes (see Exhibit 17).
