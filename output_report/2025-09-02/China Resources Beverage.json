The company will continue to focus on channel reforms, front- loaded investment for new channels/products with water volume share as key priority into 2H25, which will likely lead to S- T pain on bottom line but for L-T sustainable growth and diversification strategy. We revise down earnings by teens% to reflect mainly the enhanced investment and now expect Rmb1.08bn/Rm1.37bn net profit in 2025E/2026E with a rebound in NP growth in 2026 at \\(27\\%\\) driven by volume recovery/leveraging (with self- sufficiency ratio enhancement taking effect on steadier volume trend) and normalized investment level, meanwhile our implied 2H25 net profit is at Rmb261mn (down \\(48\\%\\) yoy on front- loaded investment amid 2H small seasonality). Key takeaways include: 1) 1H25 Recap: On water: In 1H25, the company recorded \\(- 23\\%\\) yoy decline in its packaged water dragged down by both volume (to a smaller extend) and ASP decline (mainly on channel subsidy and mix shift to mid- large pack). The mgmt. also mentioned \\(+4.6\\%\\) yoy retail- end sales growth in packaged drinking water per CIC(market share up by 0.5ppt) vs. \\(- 1.4\\%\\) yoy in industry level due to: 1) higher mix from large pack; 2) higher mix from e- commerce and discounters; 3) increased channel investment to distributors for promotions, which created gap between factory ASP vs. a steadier retail pricing level. On beverage, the beverage products achieved \\(+21\\%\\) yoy sales growth and GPM continued to expand on higher sales volume driven by newly launched 14 SKUs with more flavors and different package sizes (e.g. Zuo Wei Cha Shi 1L launched iEnd- June) although ASP slightly decreased in 1H on heightened promotions, per mgmt. 2) 2025 targets and outlook: the company expected still intense market competition into 2H while to be for better performance in L-T on its channel reform and promotions.

Beverage drinks remained key focus driven by three major categories including tea (sugared and non- sugared), Juice and Energy drinks. For tea, the company highlighted DD% yoy growth in \"Zhi Ben Qin Run\" series in 1H and expected continued new products innovation in large- size (1L) for \"Zuo Wei Cha Shi\" (already released 1L size for \"Tieguang\" and \"Yan tea\" in Jun) to fill in the gap of sales and increase competitiveness of its non- sugar tea series. The company also mentioned strengthening shipment monitoring in core channel like schools and sports places to better promote its \"Mulene\" energy drinks. 3) Channel reform and expense: the company mentioned channel reforms for long- term sustainable growth, mainly on a) cutting distributor layers with reduced layers in water in cities incl. Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, b) adding dedicated distributors for beverage (100+ added in 1H25 especially in Guangdong province) for higher shipment frequency and more flattened channel structure, c) adding distributors for specialized channels i.e. catering/online/ lower- tier areas. The company will keep investing in channel restructure and retail- end momentum for retail- end volume share with expectation of continued intense market competition going forward.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
