While management walked through key developments and plans for each of the company's businesses, the key announcement was the intention to list Reliance Jio (telecom) by June 2026. This may not be 'value unlocking' anymore as Street valuations for Jio in RIL's SoTP seem to have been marked to market to peer multiples already. Yet, the probability of higher tariffs into the IPO increases, which could be a catalyst for the RIL stock. There have been concerns of an eventual holding company discount crystallizing for RIL (post Jio listing), but a fair degree of the discount seems already built in. Reliance's relative valuations appear reasonable. Maintain O/W.",
