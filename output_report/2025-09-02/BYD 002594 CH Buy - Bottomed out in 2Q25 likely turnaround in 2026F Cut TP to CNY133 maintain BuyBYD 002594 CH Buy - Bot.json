With no more material strategy changes likely this year, we expect BYD to focus more on its 2026E key strategy. With the lessons learned in 2025, so far, we believe BYD will be well- prepared. For FY25- 27F, we lower our shipment forecasts by \\(10 - 11\\%\\) and top line forecasts by \\(9\\%\\) each, while also revising down our GPM/OPM forecasts by \\(2\\%\\) for each year, to reflect the China auto market's latest situation. As a result, our FY25- 27F earnings are \\(27 - 30\\%\\) below our previous estimates. We now forecast BYD to achieve \\(15\\% /18\\%\\) revenue/earnings CAGRs over FY24- 27F. We cut our SOTP- based TP to CNY133 (from CNY167.66), while reaffirming Buy. Our new TP implies a 2026F P/E of 23x (EPS: CNY5.68). The stock currently trades at a 2026F P/E of 20x.",

Excluding the incentives paid to dealers, we believe operating leverage worked against BYD during the quarter, as growth of its business scale was unable to keep pace with capacity growth. Meanwhile, R&D expense grew \\(71\\%\\) y- y/ \\(8\\%\\) q- q, which further squeezed OPM to \\(1.4\\%\\) (- 3.9pp y- y, - 1.9pp q- q), the lowest level, at least, of the past five years.

With increasing R&D cost (incremental CNY10bn R&D expense in 1H25 y- y), we believe BYD remains the market leader, not only in terms of business scale but also on the EV technology side.

With multiple new upcoming overseas factories, its overseas expansion looks encouraging, which should help BYD achieve sustainable long- term growth.",

The company reported earnings of CNY6.4bn \\((- 30\\%\\) y- y, \\(- 31\\%\\) q- q), reflecting the challenges faced by the company during the quarter. Based on our estimates, its vehicle profit per shipment dropped sharply to below CNY5k per car, which is the lowest level of the past three years.",

      "text": "We believe the current business environment for BYD is driven by multiple levers, including competition dynamics, anti- involution momentum, while the key is still its own strategy of launching its \"Smart Driving Equality\" campaign this year. The feedback, based on the sales situation from the market, just reaffirms the consumption downgrade trend in the China auto sector. Therefore, providing smart driving capabilities alone is not good enough to attract consumers, compared with a cheaper price, especially in the mass market (below CNY200k). And, after some critical car accident events that increased customer awareness in 1H25, we see L2 ADAS functions' value contribution to car models becoming limited. Once again, price is still the most important factor for selling cars.",

Considering the above reasons, we believe BYD will just deliver gradual improvement for the rest of 2025F, especially in the China market. Nevertheless, given the lessons learned so far in 2025, we expect the company will be well- prepared into next year's key strategy, which is likely to be revealed post the Chinese New Year 2026. As the leader of the China EV sector, we expect the company to turnaround the entire situation in 2026F.",

The company reported overseas sales of 464k units in 1H25, and 545k units in 7M25 (+128% y- y, \\(+133\\%\\) y- y). With BYD's second overseas factory in Brazil having started mass production in Jul- 25, and also the increasing number of its ro- ro (roll- on/roll- off) ships (eight in total as of end- Aug 25) for exports, we see further potential upside ahead in terms of overseas growth. Meanwhile, looking at local sales in some key areas, e.g., EU, BYD achieved 251% y- y growth in 7M25 for new car registrations with 58k registrations achieved so far this year, albeit from a low base, according to ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers' Association). As we expect competition to intensify further in the China auto market, we believe BYD will take further efforts to enhance its global appearance in the next few years, which should eventually bear fruit in the long run.",
