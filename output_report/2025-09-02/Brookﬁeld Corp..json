The aggregate Brookfield ecosystem oversees nearly \\(\\) 1\\(tr of assets spanning real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy, private equity, private credit, and insurance solutions. We view BN as a capital compounder that is on the cusp of seeing a significant step - up in excess capital generation, resulting in faster book value growth, higher ROE and a greater return of capital (share repurchases) opportunities. This will be supported by (1) Improving cash flow dynamics in the Real Estate business - the biggest source of BN's enterprise value discount; (2) Step - up in Carried interest/ Performance fees; and (3) Steady growth in Insurance amid several business model advantages. Our bottom - up analysis of BN's capital sources and uses suggests that the firm's cumulative net capital generation will step up to an estimated \\(\\sim\\)\\)11bn 2025E- 2027E up from \\(\\sim\\)\\)3bn in 2023- 2024, with at least half of this excess capital to go toward share repurchases ( \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) of excess, consistent with the pace of deployment towards buybacks in the prior two - year period).",

For context, BN's balance sheet houses \\(\\sim \\$ 31bn\\) in Real Estate assets, including a \\(25bn portfolio of direct investment properties as well as \\~\\) 6.5bn worth of stakes in BAM- managed BSREP funds (opportunistic real estate drawdown funds). The portfolio was largely a function of a take- private transaction in mid- 2021 when Brookfield acquired its publicly traded RE holding company, BPY (a.k.a BPG). While the portfolio accounts for \\(>30\\%\\) of headline Distributable Earnings (reported as distributions from the Real Estate portfolio up to the Parent Company/BN), underlying cash flow metrics of the Real Estate portfolio have been weak, with FFO (before asset dispositions) not covering the distribution to BN. This has mostly been a function of high leverage levels and pressure from interest expense (even though underlying operating portfolio characteristics have been relatively steady). That said, we see prospects of lower interest rates (60% of BN's Real Estate portfolio is floating), healthy property- level performance across the majority of the book, and easing capital market conditions for real estate assets/asset sales driving meaningful improvement in cash flows / FFO of this business, which we think is not currently captured in the implied value of BN's Real Estate portfolio. Although the public cap rate implies a \\(40\\% - 60\\%\\) value discount to BN's current Real Estate carrying value, our SOTP analysis shows that BN's market cap implies a negative value of BN's real estate equity ownership (of approximately - \\$4bn), which we think is too punitive even under more conservative cap rate assumptions. We expect that property sales, de- leveraging and stronger FFO over the coming years will help narrow the gap between the market's currently ascribed negative value to BN's real estate portfolio and values implied by current cap rates.",

We estimate that the portfolio generated - \\(\\) 187\\\\(mn in cash flow (FFO) during 2024; the annual dividend to BN is\\) \\ \\(500mn\\) . Over this period of time, BN has been using its own capital to pay down corporate level debt at the BPG portfolio - which while incrementally helpful in bridging to positive cash flows from the RE portfolio in the future, the contribution has been a drag on BN's aggregate capital generation; since 2023, we estimate that \\(>\\) 3bn of corporate BPG debt has been paid down by BN, accounting for \\(>20\\%\\) of the \\(\\) 14bn\\$ in total DE that BN generated in the same period.

      "text": "With retail annuities being a relatively commoditized product, we think the main considerations for an annuity buyer will be the credit quality of the originator and the crediting rate of the product. Customer service / sales support clearly plays a role, but this is more difficult to assess objectively. Our analysis of current product offerings shows that BWS will toggle the crediting rate it offers to new buyers; however, the firm is typically 25- 50bps below the top- end of the range, with management noting that absent a strong need to grow the balance sheet, it would rather take moderate growth with lower liability costs. Rather than compete on crediting rates, we note that the BWS offerings will often carry a high \"first year guaranteed yield\", with a lofty premium bonus offered to buyers. For example, a \\(10,000\\) annuity purchase (the premium) with an \\(11\\%\\) premium bonus suggests that the buyer would receive an incremental \\(\\) 1,100\\(that is credited to his or her annuity value in year 1, subject to certain conditions (withdrawal / surrender commitments, etc.). This\\) 11\\% \\(credit, coupled with a fixed yield of\\) 3\\% \\(would imply a guaranteed first- year yield of\\) 14\\% \\(; the headline crediting rate for the annuity is\\) 3\\% \\(. We show this example (based on an actual 7- Yr American National Fixed Indexed Annuity offered by BWS) in Exhibit 94. Importantly, the premium bonus is considered part of an insurance company's \"deferred acquisition cost\", which is amortized over the life of the product; it is not part of the reported \"cost of funds\" and utilizing premium bonuses is a way to preserve reported net spread. We believe that using this model, BWS has ample room to toggle headline crediting rates higher without being a \"price setter\" when it wishes to take market share.",

Athene was capturing \\(22\\%\\) market share that year, while Global Atlantic was capturing \\(6\\%\\) (Exhibit 98). In aggregate, almost 1/4 of total annuity sales are via the Bank channel.

The firm is aiming to maintain or expand the \\(\\sim 180\\) bps spread in annuities over time. Notably, the firm's spreads on the annuity book has been compressing modestly from \\(>200\\) bps to about 175bps in 2Q25 amid tightening industry credit spreads and meaningful competition for fixed annuity sales. That said, the 175bps- 180bps range in 1H25 is still running above closest peers (ATH/APO and G.A./KKR), which were in 140- 150bps range in 1H25. Part of the BWS' relative premium comes from higher overall earning yields \\((>5.7\\%\\) in 1H25) vs. ATH at around \\(5.2\\%\\) and G.A. at \\(4.65\\% - 4.75\\%\\) range; BWS has relatively higher asset allocation to Alternative strategies. Given tight industry credit spreads, continued competitive pressures, and prospects of lower interest rates, we expect BWS spreads to see modest compression over the next 12- 18 months, bottoming in the 160bps range, before improving back toward the firm's most recent range of \\(\\sim 180\\) bps.

Our SOTP analysis implies an \\(82 12\\) - month value, while the ROE- informed P/B framework suggests a \\(74 12\\) - month value or on a target P/B of 2.3X (on 2026 BVPS). With a 50/50 mix, our 12- month price target is \\(78 - or\\) an implied 2026 P/E of 17.3X and P/B of 2.6X (for shares of BN.TO, we estimate a\\)107 target price based on spot FX rate of 1.37). For context, BN shares currently trade at 14.5X 2026 P/E - this compares to a \\(\\sim 19X\\) multiple for the closest Alternative Managers' peers (APO and KKR).

We believe this is warranted given the earnings mix of the three firms. As we show in Exhibit 117, BN has less FRE exposure than both names, which is considered to be the highest multiple earnings stream in our Alts coverage - well below KKR's \\(\\sim 55\\%\\) FRE mix, and also below APO's \\(40\\%\\) . That said, when accounting for carried interest and earnings from B/S holdings, BN's mix skews more towards Alts than does APO (where insurance earnings at \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) of segment earnings). Additional considerations include BN's direct exposure to Real Estate assets owned on the balance sheet.

      "text": "Across our groups, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
