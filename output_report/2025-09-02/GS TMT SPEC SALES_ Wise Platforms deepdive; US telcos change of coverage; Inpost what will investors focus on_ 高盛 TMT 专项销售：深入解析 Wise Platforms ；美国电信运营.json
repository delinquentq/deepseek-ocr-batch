Unlike in years past where competitive responses were largely through plan pricing and wireless handset promotions, we are seeing more competitive activity through wireless and wireline bundling (\"convergence\"), network leadership & modernization efforts, and price- value offerings including third party services (e.g., streaming, AI). Our Buy ratings on AT&T (T) and T- Mobile (TMUS) reflect our view that their investments in network modernization, spectrum, and brand will help drive the most attractive financial returns including industry leading (1) EBITDA growth; (2) free cash flow conversion; and (3) shareholder capital returns – which justify their premium EV/EBITDA valuation multiples. Our Buy rating on Verizon (VZ) is out- of- consensus, in our view; despite some tactical caution related to 3Q25E phone net additions, our positive view reflects upside to consumer wireless service revenue on waning promotional amortization headwinds and Perks contributing \\(\\sim 100\\) bps to growth, as well the potential for better- than- expected cost & revenue synergies from the proposed acquisition of Frontier.",
