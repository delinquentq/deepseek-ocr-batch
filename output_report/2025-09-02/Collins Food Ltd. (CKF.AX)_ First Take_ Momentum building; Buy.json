In Germany, the significant improvement SSSg, combined with robust store- level margins, underpins Collins long- term strategy to expand more aggressively into the region which has strong support from Yum. While FY26 Npat guidance was reaffirmed, we continue to see upside risk in the near- term as cost deflation is annualized, digital and productivity improvements are integrated and as the consumer spending exhibits further recovery. Longer term, we expect earnings growth to be supported by the exit of Taco Bell, which continues to drag on earnings, and an elevated store expansion of KFC into Europe. Buy.",
