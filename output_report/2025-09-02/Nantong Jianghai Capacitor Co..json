What was new at the earnings call is the confirmation from Jianghai management of receiving an EDLC order from Meta, guiding to c. \\(30\\%\\) market share and revenue contribution of c.Rmb300mn in 2026. We have incorporated the guidance, but note that, from an assessment of the product performance, Jianghai's supercapacitor's Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR), the key parameter to assess how quickly EDLC can deliver the power, is still very much lagging behind German peer Skeleton (private co). After factoring in the contribution from rack-level applications of aluminum electrolytic capacitors (6- 8% of firmware revenue in 2026- 30E) and supercapacitors, both EDLC and LIC (5- 11% of firmware revenue in 2026- 30E), as well as GPM expansion from \\(26\\%\\) in 2026E to \\(26.7\\%\\) in 2030E, we revise up our 2025- 30E EPS by \\(4 - 41\\%\\) . We revise up Jianghai's 2026E target multiple from 15x to 25x against a higher EPS CAGR of \\(19\\%\\) in 2025- 30E, and our new 12-m T per arrives at Rmb28.5, with \\(22\\%\\) downside. We remain Neutral rated given we believe we have factored in bullish outlook for the new revenue growth drivers, but still see uncertainties in the market share without competitive product quality, and especially if global players can expand their capacity in a timely way.",
