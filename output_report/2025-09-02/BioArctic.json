      "text": "BioArctic reported 2Q25 earnings which were largely in- line with expectations given the key metric of Leqembi sales had previously been reported by partners BIIB and Eisai and came in ahead of pre- results expectations aided by a one- time stocking effect in China. Management guidance for operating expenses in FY25 was lowered with the company now expecting \\(50 - 70\\%\\) growth compared to \\(60 - 80\\%\\) growth guided to at 1Q25. With financials beyond Leqembi of limited importance and key pipeline timelines on track, focus was on the company's BrainTransporter platform following announcement of a collaboration agreement with Novartis announced on 26th August. The platform is an area of increasing investor focus given that Novartis is the third large cap pharma company to collaborate with BioArctic which we believe supports initial steps to early validation of the platform supported by clinical data from competitor Roche which uses a similar transferrin approach. We see the Novartis collaboration as a key positive development for BioArctic bringing meaningful upfront cash (\\$30mn) and adding to collaborations with BMS and Eisai (Exhibit 1). Whilst we await clinical data to attribute explicit value of the collaborations in our model with the BMS partnered asset potentially entering clinical trials in 2026, we believe the three collaborations add credibility to BioArctic's technology capabilities and thus increase our terminal growth assumption and lower our WACC to reflect the potential future value given the company expects to continue to enter into collaboration agreements for the platform in neuroscience and beyond. Furthermore, we expect the additional collaboration to aid in building investor awareness of the company. Additionally, FDA approval of the Leqembi autoinjector in the maintenance setting represents another positive catalyst, in our view, which we believe should provide the market with incremental reassurance on long- term revenue expectations.

Additionally, BIOAb management flagged the commercial potential of the asset, pointing to a sizeable patient population expanding several indications associated with its undisclosed biological target. Recall BIOAb announced the deal on Aug 26 (see the press release here), which includes an upfront payment of \\(30mn\\) (20% of which is expected to be booked in 2025 as revenue per management on the call), with potential additional payments of up to \\(772mn\\) tiered and mid- single digit % royalties on future global product sales if the product reaches the market. Furthermore, BIOAb management underscored the deal as the third partnership for the company's BrainTransporter technology following the BMY and Eisai deals and the first with a collaboration structure where BrainTransporter is to be incorporated into the partner's molecule rather than BIOAb developing and licensing out the whole molecule. The company continues to develop multiple modalities for the technology including antibodies, enzymes, proteins, peptides, antisense molecules, and small molecules and sees potential for more partnership deals going forward with both collaboration structures under consideration.",

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
