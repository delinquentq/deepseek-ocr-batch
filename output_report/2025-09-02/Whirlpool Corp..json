      "text": "Net Pricing Steady Despite Weak Demand: To better assess the competitive environment around Labor Day, we scanned appliance pricing across three retailers and five major manufacturers. Overall, results reflect continued discipline with net industry price up 223bps YOY vs +354bps at Fourth of July, as manufacturers look to mitigate the impact of tariffs and rising input costs. More specifically, we note discounts declined 102bps vs Fourth of July to \\(24\\%\\) , below the 202bps average for the last couple of years, but rose 150bps YOY. We found a 496bps delta between producers, with Samsung the most promotional at \\(27\\%\\) while Electrolux was the least at \\(22\\%\\) , down 69bps YOY. In our view, the YOY increase in promotions comes as demand remains anemic while producers look to raise list prices to offset inflation and maintain margins. By category, promotions were led by more discretionary products with ranges at \\(28\\%\\) as larger remodeling projects remain depressed. Given the challenging consumer backdrop, we look for near-term demand to remain subdued, though we are encouraged by the move in net pricing. Factoring in cost reduction initiatives, we believe WHR is positioned to largely offset volume deleverage, and model the North American major domestic appliance segment operating margin down only 14bps YOY in 2025 to \\(6.4\\%\\) , with 3Q off 103bps YOY to \\(6.3\\%\\) .",

This was led by LG up 973bps YOY, while Electrolux was down 70bps YOY.
