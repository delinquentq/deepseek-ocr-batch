Headline HICP ticked up by 1bp to \\(2.05\\%\\) yoy in August, a touch stronger than our expectations and in line with consensus. Using our seasonal adjustment methodology, aimed to closely replicate the ECB's, we estimate that seasonally adjusted sequential core inflation was \\(0.21\\%\\) mom in August, down slightly from the July's reading of \\(0.22\\%\\) mom, as sequential goods inflation went down to \\(0.06\\%\\) mom. Our flash measure of underlying inflation moved sideways at \\(0.14\\%\\) mom in August. Incorporating the August flash release into the Euro area inflation path we now see core inflation at \\(2.3\\%\\) yoy in Q3 and \\(2.1\\%\\) yoy in Q4, slightly below the ECB's June projections. As for headline inflation, we continue to see it mostly at target until the end of the year, but broadly below thereafter.",
