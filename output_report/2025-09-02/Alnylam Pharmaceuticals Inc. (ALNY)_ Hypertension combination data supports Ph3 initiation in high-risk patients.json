Treatment with the \\(300mg\\) and \\(600mg\\) doses resulted in placebo- adjusted reductions of office systolic blood pressure (SBP) at three months of \\(5mmHg\\) \\((p = 0.0431)\\) and \\(3.3mmHg\\) \\((p = 0.1830)\\) , respectively, thus missing the bar for statistical significance of \\(p< 0.05\\) for both doses or \\(p< 0.025\\) for one dose. However, subgroup analyses showed enhanced effects in high- risk patients (uncontrolled hypertension with baseline office SBP \\(\\geq 140mmHg\\) ) on a diuretic (which have synergistic effects with zilebesiran; see within) per a \\(9.2mmHg\\) reduction vs. placebo at three months at \\(300mg\\) . Therefore, ALNY/ROG will initiate the Ph3 CV outcomes trial ZENITH by YE evaluating \\(300mg\\) biannual zilebesiran in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (SBP \\(\\geq 140mmHg\\) on stable treatment) and established or high- risk CV disease on \\(\\geq 2\\) antihypertensives, one being a diuretic, as the companies believe that zilebesiran's demonstrated SBP lowering in this population — noting \\(5mmHg\\) SBP reductions can translate to \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) relative risk reduction in CV events — coupled with the improved consistency of BP control and promising cardiac biomarker data, will result in meaningful CV risk reductions. Separately, ALNY presented longer- term HELIOS- B data of Amvuttra in ATTR- cardiomyopathy indicating sustained CV benefits up to 48 months. Net, we see ALNY's Ph3 strategy for zilebesiran as logical, and continue to see pipeline execution as driving the next leg of growth beyond Amvuttra.",
