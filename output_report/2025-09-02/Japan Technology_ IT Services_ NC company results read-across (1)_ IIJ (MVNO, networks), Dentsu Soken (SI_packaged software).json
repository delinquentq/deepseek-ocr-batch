(1) 1H12/25 operating profits only edged up, falling short of guidance due to sluggish demand in financial solutions and manufacturing solutions. However, 2Q (Apr-Jun) operating profits rose 6% yoy, a slight acceleration in growth driven by the business solutions segment (wider demand for proprietary software) and Dentsu- related business. (2) 2Q orders were lackluster, rising by only 1% yoy. This owed largely to the absence of large- scale projects in manufacturing solutions and SAP- related business. Inquiries are recovering on a real basis, mainly in financial solutions and business solutions. The financial solutions business is expanding, mainly among banks, while large- scale projects are starting to move in business solutions for mainstay systems such as STRAVIS (consolidated accounting), POSITIVE (human resource management), and \\(\\mathrm{Ci}^* \\mathrm{X}\\) (expense management). (3) FY12/25 operating profit guidance (¥23.0 bn, \\(+9\\%\\) yoy) is unchanged. 2H guidance calls for operating profits of ¥12.3 bn (+16% yoy), implying an acceleration in growth. The company expects momentum to pick up in financial solutions and business solutions, where orders are on a recovery trend, with growth also underpinned by the dropout of unprofitable projects (approximately ¥0.3 bn in manufacturing solutions) and stable growth in Dentsu- related business.

The main factor was weaker- than- expected demand for financial solutions and manufacturing solutions. The financial solutions unit was unable to offset the loss of two large- scale projects in FY12/24 with other projects, while the manufacturing solutions unit was unable to offset the dropout of a large- scale SAP project. Dentsu Soken said the impact of reciprocal tariffs on corporate investment was limited, and was not a factor in the shortfall. As discussed below, the company maintained its full- FY12/25 guidance despite the shortfall in 1H. 2Q (Apr- Jun) operating profits rose \\(+6\\%\\) yoy to ¥4.88 bn (+¥0.28 bn yoy), a slight acceleration in growth. By segment, financial solutions (- 24%/- ¥0.25 bn yoy) struggled due to a high yoy hurdle and declining demand, mainly among banks and leasing companies, while manufacturing solutions (- 4%/- ¥60 mn yoy) saw profitability decline due to the absence of high- margin SAP projects. However, profit growth was driven by business solutions (+29%/+¥0.44 bn yoy), which began to benefit from large- scale projects for its mainstay HR management and consolidated accounting systems, and communication IT (+35%/+¥0.15 bn yoy; Exhibit 4) on a recovery in Dentsu- related business.
