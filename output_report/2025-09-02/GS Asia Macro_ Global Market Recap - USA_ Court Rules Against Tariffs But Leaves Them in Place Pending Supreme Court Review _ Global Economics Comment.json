Starmer also appointed former deputy governor at the BoE Shafik as his new chief economic adviser, a move that is seen as undermining Rachel Reeves's authority. Both appointees are expected to heavily involved in shaping the taxation and spending decisions the Chancellor will unveil this autumn (date yet to be announced).

On the other hand, the 25yr+ sector was firm, possibly due to switching buying, and the ultra-long curve bear flattened. As a result, the 30-40yr sector outperformed on the curve, while the 20-25yr sector underperformed. Ahead of the 10yr auction, the sector has seen continued robust dip-buying demand above 1.6% amid a gradual rise in rates, and the tight repo rates suggest that there is a certain degree of short positions in the market. However, valuations on the curve are expensive, and dealers' risk appetite is low, so the concession appears to be somewhat insufficient.",

These tariffs account for 8pp of the increase in the effective tariff rate to date. The CAFC delayed the effect of its ruling until Oct. 14 or, assuming the Trump administration appeals the ruling, whenever the Supreme Court either declines to review the case or issues a judgement. If the Supreme Court agrees to review the case, this could leave the tariffs in place until as late as June 2026. Legal uncertainty could lead the Trump administration to shift tariffs to other statutory bases but, however the Supreme Court ultimately rules, the president will retain substantial authority to impose tariffs.",

First, several inputs have been discontinued since our last update in 2020. For affected economies, we find a substitute (if available) and re- estimate the weights that determine each indicator's contribution to the overall growth signal. Second, we harmonize (across the economies) the pandemic- affected months from 2020- 2021 that we exclude when estimating the relationship between the CAI's activity signal and GDP. Third, for several economies we update our estimates of the relationship between business surveys and GDP that we use to capture nonlinearities. For most economies these changes lead to modest revisions, and our historical global, DM, and EM CAIs are essentially unchanged. And for economies where revisions are visible, they generally lead to an increase in the correlation with historical GDP. We therefore see these changes as a modest improvement to our global CAIs.",

If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the offered Product, the price quoted by Goldman Sachs would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, and the quoted price (and the value of the Product that Goldman Sachs will use for account statements or otherwise) could be higher or lower than the original price, and may be higher or lower than the value of the Product as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs. If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase the Product or otherwise values the Product, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, if you sell the Product, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. Goldman Sachs may conduct market making activities in the Product. To the extent Goldman Sachs makes a market, any price quoted for the OTC derivative transactions, Goldman Sachs may differ significantly from (i) their value determined by reference to Goldman Sachs pricing models and (ii) any price quoted by a third party. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.",

If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the offered Product, the price quoted by Goldman Sachs would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, and the quoted price (and the value of the Product that Goldman Sachs will use for account statements or otherwise) could be higher or lower than the original price, and may be higher or lower than the value of the Product as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs. If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase the Product or otherwise values the Product, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, if you sell the Product, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. Goldman Sachs may conduct market making activities in the Product. To the extent Goldman Sachs makes a market, any price quoted for the OTC derivative transactions, Goldman Sachs may differ significantly from (i) their value determined by reference to Goldman Sachs pricing models and (ii) any price quoted by a third party. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.",
