      "text": "COSCO Shipping Energy reported 1H25 results on Aug 29 after market close and hosted an analyst briefing on Sep 1. The company reported 1H25 net profit of Rmb1.9bn, implying 2Q25 net profit of Rmb1.2bn (- 17% YoY/+64% QoQ), which slightly beat our expectation. However, the company did not declare any interim dividend, as they are waiting for completion of the proposed A- share private placement in Sep/Oct- 25 (announced in Jan- 25), and said they would resume dividend payment after that. Key takeaways include: 1) COSCO Energy's 2Q25 average crude and product tanker TCE tracking better than industry TCE; 2) Management expects industry VLCC- TCE to remain elevated in 2H25 to achieve positive YoY growth, and sees 1- year forward TCE of \\(40k - 50k\\) as an achievable estimate amid OPEC+ output increase, global restocking and peak seasonality in 4Q25; 3) The company guided 2H25 cost % increase to be slower than that in 1H25, as they do not expect additional leases. No additional costs to fulfill environmental requirements in the short term. 4) Vessel delivery will be concentrated in 2027- 28. Target to maintain total fleet size at a stable level, and plan to exit and introduce new vessels roughly at the same pace.",
