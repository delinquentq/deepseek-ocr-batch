Now, after initial biweekly IV treatment for 18 months, patients can transition to either monthly IV or at- home weekly subcutaneous maintenance dosing, thus increasing patient convenience while easing the challenges associated with IV dosing (e.g., infusion capacity, preparation, monitoring), per BIIB. Management has discussed expectations for subcutaneous maintenance (to launch on October 6) to prepare the market for subcutaneous induction in - mid- 26 - which in tandem with the rising use of Fujirebio's blood- based diagnostic, we see as important tailwinds for alleviating bottlenecks and expanding the breadth/depth of prescribers. We next look to a potential interim analysis for LLY's Ph3 preclinical Alzheimer's trial in 2H+, while overall remaining focused on execution on the late- stage pipeline assets and business development.",

Generally, physicians are using BBBs and then confirming with PET, and BIIB has pointed out that it is too early to implement BBBs for treatment or ARIA monitoring as they are more binary and indeterminant. That said, they could be used to reduce the number of patients that need to be triaged when used in combination with cognitive tests - for example, BIIB's use of BBBs in the AHEAD 3- 45 study as a pre- screening tool reduced the screening failure rate by \\(50\\%\\) .
