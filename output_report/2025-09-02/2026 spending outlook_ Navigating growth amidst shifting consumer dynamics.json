(See here for agenda and registration). We expect the messaging to be cautious around the health of the consumer and macro uncertainties into the back half of 2025. However, while there continue to be concerns around the spending behavior, we remain cautiously optimistic going into 2026. We expect an improvement in disposable personal income growth, which, coupled with the potential benefit from easing interest rates and moderating essential spending should drive an improvement in discretionary cash inflow for consumers into next year.",

Our economists expect real disposable personal income growth to improve in 2026 from 2025, driven by a pickup in job growth, fading inflation from tariffs, and a moderate fiscal boost at the start of next year. Furthermore, as we layer this into our discretionary cash flow (DCF), we expect an improvement in total household cash flow growth in 2026 of \\(+4.2\\%\\) , up from \\(+3.8\\%\\) in 2025, based on slightly higher mortgage equity withdrawals and borrowings in an easing interest rate environment. This, along with moderating financial obligations as well as more modest outlays for essential spending should support pre- savings DCF growth of \\(+4.6\\%\\) in 2026, up from \\(+3.8\\%\\) in 2025. That said, we note that this remains below the \\(+5.4\\%\\) average pre- Covid (i.e., 2009- 19) growth levels. In addition, our economists expect a roughly \\(4.9\\%\\) savings rate (as a \\(\\%\\) of income), which could also provide support for possible acceleration in spending growth for 2026, as is illustrated in our savings- adjusted discretionary cash flow forecast of \\(+4.1\\%\\) , up from \\(+3.8\\%\\) in 2025.",
