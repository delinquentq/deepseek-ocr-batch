While our base case is that freight still enjoys peak season seasonality around the resilient consumer, it is conceivable that shippers/retailers could wait too long to place orders and arrange for shipping - if this were to materialize (we may need a few more weeks to ascertain this based on commentary from transports over earnings season), then peak season could yet underwhelm from a volume/revenue perspective. While this would pose some risk to 2H profit trajectory for our coverage group (another push to the right), it could also give rise to an interesting scenario as we move into 2026; namely, with inventories at retail not necessarily overburdened (see Exhibit 10 of our Monthly Mosaic), we could see the potential for a meaningful re- stock event (after a \\(2+\\) year freight recession largely focused on destocking) should the consumer remain resilient and spend during peak holiday shopping in 2025, and in conjunction with such factors as potential Fed cuts (GS economists predict three consecutive 25bps cuts beginning in September). Should we get a re- stock event in 2026, that would likely be quite favorable to overall freight flows and in turn incremental margins.",
