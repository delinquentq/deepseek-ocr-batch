Scan GS Credit Strat Reid Zhou's recent piece for some low-cost hedges/expressions that could merit adding; 2) as GIR noted in their most recent Credit Trader, dispersion has remained high across Lev Fin, but a large portion of that metric continues to be driven by lower-quality issuers. 101 issuers fall into the top decile of the USD HY index constituents ranked by spread, but only 10 issuers account for 38% of the total par value of the bonds outstanding. Those 10 largest issuers have a median net leverage ratio of 7.9x while five of the ten have negative interest coverage ratios However, all \"higher-quality\" issuers are not immune as is evident by the pullback seen in cyclical sectors, many in spite of their higher ratings profiles. Yes, the impending Fed cuts could help the economics of certain issuers' refinancing challenges, but with current yields for CCCs sitting 250bps above their maturing coupon levels, caution around cyclical risk in the USD HY market (ratings agnostic) and towards CCCs in general should continue to be heeded",

Job growth is likely to look mediocre in coming months as well due to subdued activity growth and special factors including federal government workforce reductions, the loss of Temporary Protected Status, and tighter immigration enforcement. This should support our forecast of three 25bp cuts in September, October, and December, followed by two more next year.
