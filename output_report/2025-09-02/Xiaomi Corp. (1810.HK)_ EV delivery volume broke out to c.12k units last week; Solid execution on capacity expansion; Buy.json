This corresponds to the consistently shortened expected waiting time for Xiaomi YU7 series delivery, from 51 weeks on average in early Aug to 47 weeks on average as of today, while expected waiting time for Xiaomi SU7 series has been largely unchanged (Exhibit 2). Meanwhile, Xiaomi announced plans for EV sales store expansion for Sep to total 402 stores in 119 cities by Sep- end (Exhibit 3).",

If the delivery run rate in Sep sustains at the similar level or higher, we see upside to 97- 99k total deliveries in 3Q25E as per GSe/Visible Alpha Consensus Data, as well as to management guidance of 350k deliveries in 2025. The shortened expected waiting time for Xiaomi YU7 series also implies that the delivery mix is shifting toward YU7 to close to 1:1 between YU7 and SU7 by our estimate, leading to more favorable ASP mix in 3Q/4Q25E for Xiaomi EV segment.",

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
