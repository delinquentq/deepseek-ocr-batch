      "text": "The Peruvian banking regulator released credit data for July, showing loan growth acceleration and stable asset quality for the system and Credicorp. Notably, the gap in loan growth between Credicorp and the system narrowed, with loans expanding \\(4.8\\%\\) at the system vs. \\(4.0\\%\\) at Credicorp. Moreover, spreads deteriorated for the system, but improved for Credicorp. Nonetheless, net interest income worsened and the equity base increased for both, driving ROE contraction. We are Neutral rated on Credicorp, as the company should sustain high- teens ROEs in the medium term, but the stock trades at \\(10.2\\times 2026\\mathrm{E} / \\mathrm{P} / \\mathrm{evs}\\) .

Growth was across the board with stronger SME (+350bps to \\(- 4.8\\%\\) ) and large corporate loan growth (+260bps to \\(7.5\\%\\) ) supporting commercial growth, while credit card (+320bps to \\(0.3\\%\\) ) and installments (+220bps to \\(12.2\\%\\) ) boosted the consumer portfolio. Similarly, Credicorp's loan growth accelerated even further, by 410bps mom to \\(4.0\\%\\) due to stronger growth across all categories, including commercial (+520bps to \\(1.6\\%\\) ), consumer (+280bps to \\(+11.4\\%\\) ) and mortgage loans (+130bps to \\(7.1\\%\\) ).",

Similarly, the PDL ratio at Credicorp was stable as well at \\(3.4\\%\\) , as better mortgage (- 10bps to \\(2.7\\%\\) ) was also offset by steady consumer ( \\(3.4\\%\\) ) and commercial PDL ratios ( \\(3.7\\%\\) ). Separately, spreads decreased at the system (- 60bps to \\(8.5\\%\\) ) with net interest income down \\(12\\%\\) mom.
