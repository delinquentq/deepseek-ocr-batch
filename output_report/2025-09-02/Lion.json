We trim our 12- month target price from ¥1,950 to ¥1,900 to reflect our new estimates, a change in our valuation base year from FY12/26E to the average of FY12/26E and FY12/27E, and a change in our target multiple from 23X to 21X.

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
