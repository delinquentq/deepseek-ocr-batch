Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
