The limits will be monitored from October onwards, with penalties from Dec 6th if breaches are found on expiry day. The intra- day position limit for index options will be INR5,000 cr (vs end of day INR1,500 cr) on a net FutEq basis (or delta- adjusted basis), and INR10,000 cr (same as end of day INR10,000 cr) on a gross FutEq basis. Recall that around end of May'25, SEBI finalised its deliberations with market participants and concluded against setting any intra- day limit.",

We had then assessed a \\(\\sim 5\\%\\) impact to industry options premiums on back of end- of- day position limits introduction. Now that intra- day position limits will be introduced the impact is likely to be bigger than our previously assessed \\(\\sim 5\\%\\) impact. Hence, we reduce our industry index options premium penetration terminal ratio from \\(\\sim 0.5X\\) to \\(\\sim 0.3X\\) . It remains challenging to predict exact impact given lack of data on the size of intra- day exposure for key participants relative to end- of- day.",
