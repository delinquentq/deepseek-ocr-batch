We are seeing heightened visibility for the defense opportunities in both the US and non- US regions, which we believe is the key valuation re- rating factor for the Korean shipbuilding sector. In the US, while we are still waiting for potential changes or exceptions to the Byrnes- Tollefson Amendment, for which the Korean shipbuilders are lobbying aggressively in the US, we believe the recent US- Korea summit (link) indicates that Korea will have a strong role in rebuilding US Navy capabilities. In overseas ex- US, Hanwha Ocean has been selected as a finalist in the W60T Canada submarine contract (along with German TKMS), where Hanwha has a competitive edge in delivery time. The Canadian prime minister will also make a visit to Hanwha's Geojie shipyard in October. We see a huge TAM in the global navy market, which amounts to \\(\\) 199B\\(, as per our estimate (link to report), and we note that these orders would be margin accretive, given production domestically. We expect to see more developments around several naval orders in the short to mid term, including the Poland submarine order, ME orders for both surface ships and submarines, and Thailand frigate re- orders. We expect Hanwha Ocean's share price to be strongest in the near term with several order- related catalysts. With heightened visibility on naval orders, we raise our target price orderbook multiple to 0.87x (from 0.8x) and raise our PT to W140K. Reiterate OW.",

The company recently announced a merger with HD Hyundai Mipo (Mipo), hoping to change its business structure from commercial- centric to higher exposure to the navy business. This is a drastic change in the company's attitude towards the defense business, where the company is showing swift moves to fully utilize its key assets for naval fleet building. With the merger with Mipo, and opening of dock #5, the company will have a total annual capacity of c.12 units of surface vessels and 1 submarine, which should well serve the global navy TAM (link to report). We expect to hear more developments around the US navy business in the near term (changes in regulations) and more updates on global ex- US orders, which should be key share price catalysts. With heightened visibility for navy opportunities, we raise our target price to orderbook multiple to 0.89x (from previous 0.8x) and raise our PT to W660K. Reiterate OW.",

Mipo was considered to have relatively less navy exposure compared to HHI/KSOE and Hanwha Ocean, but with the merger, we expect to see positive share price momentum from ample navy related catalysts ahead. Moreover, with the merger ratio set at 1:0.4 (HHI:Mipo), we think positive navy business development at HHI should also lead to similar price movement for Mipo, with potential market arbitrage trade between the two stocks. After a shareholders' meeting to approve the merger on \\(23^{\\text{rd}}\\) October, the effective date of merger will be on \\(1^{\\text{st}}\\) December.

The merger announced recently by the group clearly shows a change of attitude towards the defense business, in our view, for which the company has been relatively more conservative vs. peers. We expect to see more investments with regards to capacity in the US and overseas to well capture the global navy opportunities (link to report). The merger also allows the group to 1) fully utilize key assets/resources (including labor) and capacity for future orders, 2) centralize and heighten efficiency for overseas shipyards that were previously dispersed under different companies. We expect the group's navy related sales (from HHI) to amount to W8.7T by 2030, deeming the group's guidance of W7T as conservative, with OP coming in at W0.8T - margin accretive orders coming from global ex- US orders which should be built domestically.",

In USD terms, MSCI Korea ended 1.5% lower, underperforming the China- led gains in Asia ex- Japan. The month started with a rise in uncertainty about the governance reform momentum as the tax reform bill proposed by the DP raised investor concerns about policy orientation. Over time, though, investors took some comfort in both the administration's willingness to revisit proposals in the tax reform package, as well as the second amendment to the Commercial Code (this time including mandatory cumulative voting and expansion of the audit committee selection process). On the geopolitical front, President Lee met with US President Trump on 25 Aug, outlining plans for Korean investments in the US across various sectors. Domestically, Korea saw broad- based gains in retail sales, growth in investments, upbeat industrial production, and strong consumer confidence, all of which lead to modest upside risk to 3Q25 GDP forecasts. The govt also significantly increased the budget, indicating a shift to expansionary fiscal policies. In this context, the BoK held policy rates steady. At a stock level, Insurance, Shipbuilders and Internet names outperformed, while Defense, Pharma and Banks underperformed. HD Hyundai Heavy will merge with its affiliate HD Hyundai Mipo to meet the rise in defense vessel demand. Earnings estimates for Korea continued to be revised higher in Aug, esp. in the IT sector.",
