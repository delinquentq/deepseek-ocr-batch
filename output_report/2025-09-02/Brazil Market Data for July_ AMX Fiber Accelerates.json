On the prepaid side, net losses (- 457k) were fewer than in June for all three major operators. AMX having outpaced competitors in terms of mobile service revenue growth (and prepaid revenue specifically) in 2Q25 and prior quarters has been a major topic of discussions with investors (and in a recent meeting with AMX management in Brazil); while per prior quarters the revenue- growth differential seems largely ARPU- driven, we do believe the continued debate on revenue- growth differences warrants a close watch on volumes (particularly postpaid) as investors begin to consider 3Q results prospects.",
