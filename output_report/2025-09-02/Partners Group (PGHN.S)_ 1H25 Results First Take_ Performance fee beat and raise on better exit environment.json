Management fees and other revenues came in \\(1\\%\\) below consensus, with Other revenues impacted by lower late management fees and treasury management services income, and also impacted by \\(3\\%\\) YoY FX drag. Offsetting this slightly, operating costs came in \\(5\\%\\) higher vs consensus, driven by higher variable performance fee expenses (which are mechanically higher on the performance fee revenue beat) and the Empira acquisition, leading to a \\(2\\%\\) beat at the EBITDA level. At the bottom line, net income missed by \\(1\\%\\) , impacted by higher D&A expenses, and a lower contribution from net finance income.",
