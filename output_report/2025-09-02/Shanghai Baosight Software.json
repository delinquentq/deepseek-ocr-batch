We look for Baosight to grow its business on (1) increased spending on production software to improve industrial manufacturing process efficiency; (2) Baowu's continued consolidation in the steel industry; and (3) Baosight's proven track record of expanding into new customers and new markets. That said, we estimate that c.60% of Baosight's revenue in 2024 was exposed to the domestic steel end- market, making it vulnerable to the current steel industry production control and capex contraction trend. Meanwhile, with 51% of Baosight's revenue (in 2024) from related- party transactions with its parent, we believe Baosight is subject to spending fluctuations from this major customer. Our 2025- 27E net income estimates are on average 35% below Wind Consensus. We consider its valuation as unattractive vs. our China Industrial Tech coverage on a P/E basis and are Sell rated. Upside risks: (1) faster expansion into ex- steel markets; (2) faster industry consolidation progress of Baowu Group; (3) faster commercialization of new products.",
