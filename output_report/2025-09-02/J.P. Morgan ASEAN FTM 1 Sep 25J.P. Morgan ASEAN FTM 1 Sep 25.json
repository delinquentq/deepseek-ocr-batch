      "text": "The investment case for Thai banks continues to be driven by capital management. A faster pace and transmission of rate cuts does dent the thesis, but not derail it. KBank is in the midst of a rare increase in shareholding from an unrelated party, which appears unsolicited. These factors, among others, have aligned management's incentives to increase payouts more aggressively and evaluate buybacks. We forecast \\(\\sim 70\\%\\) average cash payout (including special) in 2025- 27, with an additional \\(\\sim 15\\%\\) of 2026- 27 profits being used for buybacks. This adds up to \\(8 - 12\\%\\) total yield on the stock in 2025- 27, with a high degree of visibility. KBank should get a boost of \\(\\sim 19\\%\\) of profits this year (most likely) from Thai Air listing, part of which should be paid out this or next year. We forecast \\(6 - 8\\%\\) cash yield and \\(2\\%\\) buyback yield at the bank, leading to \\(8 - 10\\%\\) total yield in 2026/27. TTB's buyback phase has ended, and current rules suggest a resumption in Feb- 26. Hence, we expect a degree of consolidation in the stock price and downgrade to Neutral. A phase of time correction and possibly price correction can allow opportunities to scale up positions. BBL and SCB stay N, as it is tough to anticipate a payout increase in both these stocks; with SCB already at \\(80\\%\\) payout and \\(\\sim 8\\%\\) 2025/26 DY. Tisco stays UW, as the exceptional payout over the last decade is being replicated elsewhere. Hence, premium valuations should come off.",

AQ has held up well, with NPLs and coverage almost flat q/q, while credit costs were higher at 36bps for the quarter. This was due to the faster pace of write-offs (M\\)303mn vs. M\\)236mn last qtr), likely led by Thai operations. Payout at 55\\% was a positive. These numbers suggest consistent core trends.
