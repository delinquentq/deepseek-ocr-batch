We now provide evidence that this pivot is underway: having surveyed power utilities in our coverage, we conclude that the number of connection requests received by power distribution operators (a leading indicator of future demand) has risen exponentially over the past couple of years, mostly driven by Data Centers. We estimate a DC pipeline for Europe of c.170 GW, equivalent to about 1/3 of the region's power consumption. Although only a portion may be converted, we estimate a potential 10- 15% boost to Europe's power demand, over the coming 10- 15 years. In an industry with elevated operational and financial gearing, such an inflection in volumes would have a significant effect on corporate profits. These conclusions support our positive view on what we call \"Electrification Compounding.\" We see RWE, EDPR and SSE as the best plays on this theme.",

As a result, since 2008, electricity consumption has cumulatively declined by \\(c.10\\%\\) . However, this trend might be about to reverse: the rapid expansion in datacenters and gradual pick up of the electrification process could boost Europe's power demand by \\(c.40\\% - 50\\%\\) over the coming ten years, we estimate. In an industry with elevated operational and financial gearing, such an inflection in revenues (which is also likely to trigger secular organic growth in power grids and renewables) should have a significant effect on corporate profits. We favour 'Electrification Compounders' that mostly grow profits from power grids (and renewables), thanks to their very attractive risk/reward profiles (grids operate in natural monopoly regimes with returns based on 'cost- plus'), and continue to highlight the RES developers as discounting zero/negative value from future capacity additions. We see EON, Enel, SSE, Iberdrola and Orsted as the key exposures.",
