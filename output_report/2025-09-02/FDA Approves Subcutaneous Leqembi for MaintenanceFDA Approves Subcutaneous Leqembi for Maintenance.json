This approval may have a small positive impact on revenue, because revenue per patient will rise, but profits per patient may decline on higher COGS. This is also an important step towards securing approval for initiation- of- treatment with the SubCu formulation. We rate Eisai a Hold.",

Maintenance therapy is an option for patients who have been treated twice- per- month with the IV formulation for the 18- month initiation phase. Replacing once- per- month clinic visits with once- per- week SubCu injections represents a big improvement in convenience for these patients. The new device will generate more revenue per patient, but COGS will also be higher.",

Therefore, all else equal, adoption of IQLIK will boost revenue. However, we are not sure how many patients have been on the IV formulation for 18 months, so the revenue impact is uncertain. To the extent that a lack of injection capacity is a bottleneck for patients wanting to start treatment, shifting maintenance patients onto IQLIK might also boost overall sales. Improved convenience might also keep patients on treatment for longer. Please note that the average annual cost of treating patients during the initiation stage (18 months) with the IV formulation is about \\(26,500, depending on the patient's weight. Therefore, maintenance IV therapy, which requires once- per- month treatment rather than twice- per- month treatment, costs about half as much.",

Approval of IQLIK for this indication may come during 1HCY26, and could significantly boost the number of patients wanting to start therapy. However, approval is not certain, and the impact on demand is not certain. The impact of profits may also be lower than the impact on sales. Meanwhile, a next- generation candidate from Roche may be launched as soon as 2028, potentially hurting demand for Legembi (report). We therefore remain cautious on Eisai's stock and reiterate our Hold rating.",
