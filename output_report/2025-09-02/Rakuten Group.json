We expect the mobile business to achieve guidance for full- year EBITDA profitability in FY12/25, with EBITDA (non- GAAP) of \\(\\yen 30.0\\) bn \\((+\\) 66.3 bn yoy). Rakuten Mobile currently has no plans to raise prices, and we expect its price advantage to increase further compared to competitors, which are effectively raising prices, creating a favorable environment for mobile subscriber acquisition. In addition, we expect Rakuten Mobile to gain subscribers in regional areas from 2H12/25 onward as it strengthens its sales efforts in these areas. As a result, we look for continued strong growth, with 8.88 mn MNO subscribers at end- FY12/25 \\((+19\\% / + 1.42\\) mn yoy) and 9.65 mn subscribers including MVNO/MVNE/BCP \\((+16\\% / + 1.35\\) mn yoy), despite being slightly below the company's target (10 mn). On the other hand, network quality remains a challenge. The current roaming agreement with KDDI expires at end- September 2026, and while it is likely to be renewed from October 2026, we think the terms could be less favorable for Rakuten Mobile considering the competitive environment of KDDI. Therefore, we think Rakuten Mobile needs to step up its network investments, which have been lagging recently, to improve communication quality by building more base stations.",

In addition to growth in MNO subscribers, we think improved profitability in other businesses, such as devices and FTTH, will also contribute to the turn to profit. Looking at mobile KPIs, we expect the number of MNO subscribers (excluding low- margin MVNO/MVNE/BCP) to reach 8.88 mn at end- FY12/25 \\((+19\\% / + 1.42\\) mn yoy). While the pace of net adds \\((+1.42\\) mn) is likely to slow slightly compared to FY12/24 \\((+1.56\\) mn), we still expect strong growth to continue. With competitors raising prices and launching new, more expensive billing plans, Rakuten Mobile's decision not to raise prices should be a tailwind for subscriber acquisition, given its strong price competitiveness. In addition, the number of stores in regional areas is steadily increasing as Rakuten Mobile strengthens its sales efforts there, and we expect the company to gradually gain subscribers in these areas.",

The company has established its own Rakuten ecosystem by organically linking these services to a single membership Rakuten ID and the Rakuten Points system, which is Japan's largest loyalty point program, and in this way it aims to promote broad usage of its services. We are Neutral- rated on the stock. Although we expect stable profit growth to be driven by the competitive internet services and fintech businesses, we believe the main factors that will influence Rakuten Group's enterprise value are the number of subscribers/ARPU/roaming costs, and depreciation expenses in the mobile business. We estimate that mobile business non- GAAP EBITDA will turn positive in FY12/25 on a full- year basis.",
