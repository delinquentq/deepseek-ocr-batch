      "text": "Following AZN's presentation of baxdrostaf Ph. 3 BaxHTN results at ESC 2025 (see our recap note) and its subsequent Meet the Management at ESC 2025 webinar, we hosted a dinner NDR with MLYS mgmt + its KOL (Dr. Manish Saxena) to discuss the implications for lourndrostat. Our NDR discussion covered many topics including: 1) lourndrostat's differentiation vs. baxdrostat and those called out by AZN; 2) differences that matter in Launch- HTN's study design/patient characteristics vs. BaxHTN; 3) lourndrostat's interaction with PPIs; 4) what could potentially be shown on each drugs' product label; 5) timing of baxdrostat's NDA submission; and 6) commercial opportunity in HTN and key challenges. During AZN's webinar, mgmt expects baxdrostat's NDA submission by YE25 to support a potential launch in 2026. AZN also noted that baxdrostat's second Ph. 3 study (Bax24) is now complete and results could be available in the coming weeks and followed by a detailed presentation at a conference later this year. However, AZN notably declined to comment when asked during its webinar whether Bax24's results will be included in baxdrostat's NDA submission. It's also unclear whether baxdrostat's NDA filing could come ahead of lourndrostat's, as MLYS continues to not give further guidance beyond its pre- NDA meeting with the FDA in 4Q25. Our key takeaways from our MLYS dinner NDR and AZN's webinar are summarized below.",

Additionally, results across all relevant Ph. 3 trials including BaxHTN, Launch- HTN, and spironolactone's PATHWAY2 showed continued improvement in efficacy from 6 to 12 weeks. It is also unclear how baxdrostat's longer half- life provided any advantages over lorundrostat's shorter half- life given that Launch- HTN's SBP results were taken at the trough of lorundrostat plasma levels in the morning before next dose. Recall that MLYS does not expect rapid (95\\%\\) diuretic use, with similar ACE/ARB and CCB breakdown). However, Launch- HTN had a notably higher representation of Black patients ( \\(\\sim 27 - 32\\%\\) vs. BaxHTN's \\(\\sim 6 - 9\\%\\) across cohorts). MLYS also evaluated patients with lower eGFR between 30- 45 mL/min/1.73 m² in its Ph. 2 Explore- CKD study, which could be reflected in lorundrostat's label. The broader evidence could better support use of lorundrostat among clinicians especially when treating Black patients or those with comorbid HTN and CKD. Although the KOL was cautious on declaring a preference for either therapy since he participated in both Launch- HTN and BaxHTN studies, he acknowledged that lorundrostat's broader dataset could be more supportive while baxdrostat may be better positioned in Asian populations given their higher proportion in BaxHTN and the ongoing BaxAsia study.",

Since lorundrostat's interaction with proton- pump inhibitors (PPIs) is not a safety issue and Launch- HON allowed the use of PPls, MLYS does not expect a contraindication with PPls, its label. Note that lorundrostat's studies allowed mid- day PPI administration, following morning lorundrostat doses of up to 3 times/week. Physicians can also switch patients from PPI to H2 blockers with nighttime administration, which the KOL exercised for all of his patients in Launch- HON. Given lorundrostat also demonstrated comparable efficacy from the 25 mg QD dose in Explore- CKD (7.5 mmHg pbo- adj SBP reduction at week 4), MLYS believes patients on PPls could still achieve meaningful benefit even if the 50 mg QD dose has a reduced absorption by \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) due to PPls. Additionally, the KOL does not anticipate significant real- world issues from PPI interactions and noted the waning popularity of PPls, where his practice has reduced prescribing by \\(\\sim 75\\%\\) over the past few years due to increased risks from long- term use (Clostridium difficile, pneumonia, bone fractures, CKD, abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc.). Note that MLYS has not completed a PPI subgroup analysis but is considering a post- hoc analysis in the future.",

Despite minimal separation in placebo- adj SBP efficacy response for 1 mg and 2 mg doses of baxdrostat at week 12 in BaxHTN, AZN plans to advance both doses to allow individualized balancing of efficacy and tolerability. The KOL agreed that multiple dosing options are beneficial for clinicians. MLYS also believes that baxdrostat could be approved with two doses where the 50 mg QD will be the starting dose for most patients and the 25 mg QD could be used as the starting dose for special populations with lower eGFR or down- titration for the 50 mg dose.",

The remainder of data can be provided within the 120- day safety update period. Contrarily, BaxHTN's four- part design allowed some patients to receive continuous 52- week treatment that could be used to satisfy FDA's safety database requirements. However, it's unclear how many patients are needed to satisfy the FDA's safety requirements given its NEJM publication suggested only 245 patients continued into Part 4. Note that MLYS enrolled \\(>1.3K\\) across pivotal studies who were eligible for OLE and could have many more patients than AZN. While patients from baxdrostat's Ph. 2 HALO- OLE could potentially contribute, MLYS believes filing with a smaller safety database could have higher regulatory risk.

However, it also called out a few key challenges. The first is that many difficult- to- control HTN patients are managed primarily in general practice, underscoring the need for clear referral pathways and timely escalation to specialists. Additionally, securing Medicare Part D access in the \\(3L+\\) setting will be critical since most HTN patients are \\(>60\\) years.
