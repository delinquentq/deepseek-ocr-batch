Mysteel- reported hot metal and finished steel output has been stable since May, lining up with flat port stocks and an increase in domestic steel inventory. If anything, the improved steelmaking margins and risk that cuts are eventually enforced have instead kept steel output at a high level (Exhibit 3), worsening the domestic oversupply of steel despite steel exports holding up better than expected; flat steel inventory is now at the upper limit of the 10- year (excluding 2024) range (Exhibit 4).",

Both factors likely discourage local governments from forcing industry closures. This in line with our China economists' view of the impact of anti- involution policies more broadly in the economy. The recent recovery in margins (although not driven by fundamentals) also makes cuts more difficult to justify. As a result, we expect the \\(\\sim 15\\%\\) rally in domestic steel prices that occurred in June/July to continue to fade over the coming months, which could see steel production declining due to margin pressure, loosening iron ore market fundamentals.

In the near term, we anticipate an increase in Indian net exports following the recovery in iron ore prices over the past two months.
