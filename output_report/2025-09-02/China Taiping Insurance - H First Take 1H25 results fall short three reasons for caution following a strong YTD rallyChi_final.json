      "text": "Our First Take: China Taiping has been a YTD outperformer (57% vs. HSI: 25%), as the market has viewed this stock as a strong beta play. However, the positive stock market rally has yet to translate into favorable earnings growth. We believe the market may initially react unfavorably to the outcome. We highlight three key disappointments: (1) earnings miss: a substantial decline in unrealized gains from fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) in the bond portfolio led the company to report 1H25 net profit of HK\\(6.8B, for 12%\\) \\text{oya growth, notably below JPME of HK\\$7.2B; (2) absence of an interim dividend: shareholder return initiatives are a focal point in the sector, and major listed China SOEs have proposed 1H25 interim dividends similar to previous years' - the company's consecutive two- year omission of an interim dividend despite a sufficient capital base is unlikely to be perceived positively by the market; and (3) relative valuation: the stock currently trades at a 7x FY26E P/E with only a 2% yield vs. \\~4- 6% at major H- listed peers. We believe China Re and Ping An- H are more compelling alternatives for investors seeking dividend plays. Stay UW.",

Interim dividend agenda. Major China SOE insurers have proposed interim dividend distribution for two consecutive years. We believe interim dividend proposals are likely to be the new norm in the insurance sector, especially considering rising investor interest in shareholder return agendas. Hence, as the company has demonstrated solid capital adequacy, a key consideration in deciding interim dividends and, more importantly, the visibility of interim dividend moving forward, might be crucial on tomorrow's result call.",
