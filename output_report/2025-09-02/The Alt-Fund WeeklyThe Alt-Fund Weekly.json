Construction cost overruns are clearly a very pertinent risk for the project's equity investors, including International Public Partnerships (INPP), but we note that the funding structure is designed to cap this risk. Under the adopted Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model, INPP is fully exposed for any increase in construction costs from the planned £38bn up to £40.5bn, equivalent to c.£16m of additional potential investment against its £250m original commitment. Beyond this, equity investors, such as INPP, face 50% exposure up to a cost of £47.7bn, with no obligation to fund construction past that point, and with the UK government providing the backstop. This caps INPP's total potential additional exposure at c. £40m. Furthermore, even at this higher total cost estimate, INPP's investment would still be expected to deliver a double- digit IRR.",
