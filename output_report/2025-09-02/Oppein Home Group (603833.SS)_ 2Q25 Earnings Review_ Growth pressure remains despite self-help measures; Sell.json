      "text": "Oppen reported below- expectation 2025 results despite a lower base post market close of Aug 29. Although the weakness is also seen in other customized furniture companies (e.g. Suofeiya, GZSP), Oppen managed to record relatively smaller declines on both revenue and profits. Total revenue/net profit in 1H25 was Rmb8,241mn/Rmb1,018mn, growing by \\(- 4\\% / + 3\\%\\) yoy, and implying \\(- 3\\% / - 8\\%\\) yoy in 2Q (- 10\\% / - 16\\% vs. GSe). Similar to peers, Oppen reported positive growth from export and direct sales in 1H, but revenue declined in retail and developer channels. On margins, GPM/OPM increased by 3.2ppt/1.5ppt yoy to \\(37.6\\% /15.1\\%\\) in 2Q25, thanks to self- help measures such as cost reduction and efficiency improvement.",

We came away with the impression that: 1) Into 2H25, management remained cautious on furniture demand, yet they will strive to maintain margin resilience driven by continued cost reduction and efficiency improvement. 2) The government stimulus has helped mitigate the market decline rather than significantly boost growth, and is more beneficial to leading players per management. 3) Management is still determined on transformation into full- suite furniture provider, which could help increase average ticket size. Management commented 1.2k full- suite stores have been in operation, and expect more transformation on its R&D system to support growth. Meanwhile, management mentioned partnership with top talents to grow smaller business units such as appliances. 4) Management continued to hold a constructive view on further industry consolidation, as leading companies' competitive edge in manufacturing and digitalization should become increasing evident going forward.",

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
