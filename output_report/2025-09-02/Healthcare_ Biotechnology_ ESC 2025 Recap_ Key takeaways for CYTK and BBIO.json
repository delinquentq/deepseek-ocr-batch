      "text": "Detailed positive results from MAPLEHCM and largely incrementally positive post- hoc analyses of acoramidis pivotal studies. We detail our takeaways for some of our cardiology- focused coverage from this weekend's ESC 2025 meeting (European Society of Cardiology, Madrid, August 29 - September 1). Overall, we are encouraged by the detailed results from CYTK's Phase 3 MAPLE- HCM head- to- head study in oHCM (obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) of aficamen vs. metoprolol (beta blocker, current standard of care in the frontline setting), which showed a clear benefit to patients receiving aficamen vs. the beta blocker across the primary and all but one secondary endpoints. Additionally, we view the company's other posters and presentations (mostly on aficamen's safety from the FOREST- HCM open- label extension study) as incrementally positive. That said, the failure of BMY's (covered by Asad Haider) ODYSSEYHCM study of mavacamten (markered as Camzyos) in nHCM (non- obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) raises questions for the CMI (cardiac myosin inhibitor) class and casts some doubt on CYTK's own Phase 3 ACACIA- HCM study in the indication, which is currently enrolling patients and whose statistical analysis plan was amended earlier this year to add a second primary endpoint. However, we highlight that key differences in baseline characteristics and a different study protocol, among other disparities, could influence the outcome of the study. On the BBIO side, we note that presentations at ESC 2025 included one that was led by Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE, covered by James Quigley), its commercial partner in Europe that is responsible for the commercialization of Beyontra (acoramidis) and which explored the TTR stabilizer's effect on NT- proBNP and 6MWD (6- minute walking distance). Other presentations and posters by BBIO itself mostly focused on incrementally positive post- hoc analyses of ATTRibute- CM and its open- label extension study, which showed the continuing benefits of treatment with acoramidis on NT- proBNP and CVM/CVH (cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization). Net- net, we view the totality of our coverage's ESC presentations as positive. Ahead, we look to CYTK's planned virtual event to discuss the findings from the MAPLE- HCM study and to data readouts in other disease areas from BBIO as it advances its clinical pipeline. We discuss our key takeaways for each company in more detail below.",
