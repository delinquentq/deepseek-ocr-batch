The House Speaker will convene the Lower House to vote for next PM, but there is not yet a specific timeline. Recall that the transition from ex- PM Srettha Thavisin to PM Paetongtarn took two days in August 2024. Our base- case scenario, though situation is very fluid, assumes Phue Thai Party successfully nominates its last eligible candidate, Chaikasem Nitisiri (a former attorney general and justice minister), as the new prime minister. We see this as a compromise scenario given the current ruling coalition holds just 256 seats vs. the opposition's 239 (ThaiPBS Jun 24th) which could result in challenges in policy execution, let alone passing key laws. This could eventually lead to a call for house dissolution and elections.",
