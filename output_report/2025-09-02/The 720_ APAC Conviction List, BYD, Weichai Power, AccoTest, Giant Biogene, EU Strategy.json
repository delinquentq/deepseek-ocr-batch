For Eastroc, Leaf Liu expects the company to further expand its flagship energy drinks business while transforming into a diversified beverage company through the ramp- up of new products. For Disco, while the market still seems to be skeptical about a meaningful step- up in their shipment figures, Shuhei Nakamura believes the inflection point is close, where Disco's shipments will re- accelerate, driven by new growth drivers such as hybrid bonding. For NYPCB, Chao Wang expects non- NVDA ABF substrate pricing to increase by 5- 10% per quarter from 4Q25 to 4Q26 due to supply shortages, far exceeding the market consensus of a 3- 5% hike in 4Q25 only. Chao believes NYPCB is poised to be a key beneficiary of the pricing uptrend. For Japan Exchange, Gurpreet Singh Sahi expects three catalysts to drive the stock - 1) collateral related interest income offers EPS upside, 2) new FX derivatives to add revenue stream, and 3) bottoming out of JP corporate earnings cuts to boost cash average daily turnover.

BYD reported 2Q25 results with revenue/gross margin missing GSe by - 6%/- 1.8pp. Based on our unit profit analysis, we estimate BYD's domestic unit profit was Rmb523 in 2Q25 (vs. Rmb5.8k in 1Q25), with qoq decline mainly due to: (1) Rmb4.4k higher BOM cost of autopilot version models, in line with our expectation; (2) Rmb2.9k 1- month 618 promotion in June; (3) Rmb666 red packet to dealers. Among these factors, (1) is recurring while (2) & (3) are one- offs. As prices become stabilized under the government's \"anti- involution\" guidance, we expect unit profit in the domestic market to recover to Rmb4.4k in 3Q25E and Rmb5.0k in 4Q25E.
