      "text": "BABA announced that its quick commerce's (QC) daily average order volume reached 80mn in August, vs. our estimated 90mn for Meituan's (MT; 3690 HK, Buy). This is a temporary win for BABA given that its scale (in terms of order volume) used to be merely \\(- 40\\%\\) of MT's. BABA has already seen some benefits from its QC investment. BABA views QC as a new growth driver in its own right, as well as a driver to the entire ecosystem. QC has contributed to solid \\(25\\%\\) y- y growth of monthly active buyers on its flagship Taobao app in the first three weeks of August, according to BABA, which in turn lends support to the growth of its CMR (customer management revenue) and potential savings on the marketing dollars. As a result, BABA predicts its CMR to maintain a similar growth rate in the near term, as the \\(10\\%\\) y- y growth registered in the June quarter. By FY2028E, QC will likely add additional an CNY1tn in GMV to BABA, according to management.",

BABA indicated that the loss of CEG will likely peak in the September quarter, which we estimate likely hit CNY36bn, thus leading to a \\(74\\%\\) y- y (by CNY33bn) drop in the EBITA of CEG. We believe CEG's profitability should be able to improve gradually from September, considering the significant upfront investment in building fulfillment capabilities and acquiring users through aggressive subsidies. Now that BABA's QC has reached such a sizeable scale, we believe it will start to shift emphasis from land grabs to optimizing efficiency. All of these may help deliver a \\(41\\%\\) (q- q) narrowing of QC's loss to CNY21bn in the upcoming December.",

Yet, we believe BABA has big strength in retail- related QC. BABA can easily leverage its self- owned Freshippo supermarkets and many thousands of offline stores from brand partners on its ecommerce marketplace as suppliers for its QC.",
