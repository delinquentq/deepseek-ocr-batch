Excluding one- off items, mainly on impairment loss, disposal gain, and hog- related non- operating loss, recurring net profit (excluding earnings from Minsheng Bank) was Rmb660mn, versus a loss of Rmb1.36bn in 1H24A. The results were below our expectations, and tracking behind Refinitiv consensus, on non- operation related factors such as a higher effective tax rate.

Feed operation was stable and solid in 1H25, with emerging improvement from the overseas operation. Our view on the domestic hog segment remains positive - expecting improving supply/demand fundamentals in China's domestic hog market for 2026E, driven by potential improving industry supply discipline, related to control in sow herd, output weight and secondary fattening, amid demand likely to remain soft. Unit cost of NHL has also seen improvement, on track with industry average pace, over 2024- 1H25A. We expect NHL to deliver \\(145\\%\\) earnings growth in 2025E, followed by \\(195\\%\\) in 2026E. Risk- reward appears more balanced - Upgrade to Neutral from Sell with a revised 12- m target price of Rmb9.2/sh (from Rmb6.3/sh).",

We expect unit GP of feed to stabilize for 2025E, underpinned by better- than- expected hog and aqua feed performance. Feed operation was stable and solid in 1H25, with emerging improvement from the overseas operation. Our view on the domestic hog segment remains positive - expecting improving supply/demand fundamentals in China's domestic hog market for 2026E, driven by potential improving industry supply discipline, related to control in sow herd, output weight and secondary fattening, amid demand likely to remain soft. Unit cost of NHL has also seen improvement, on track with the industry average pace, over 2024- 1H25A. We expect NHL to deliver \\(145\\%\\) earnings growth in 2025E, followed by \\(195\\%\\) in 2026E. We are Neutral rated on NHL as we believe its current valuation has fairly priced in its improvement in feed operation and potential in cost cutting on hog farming.",
