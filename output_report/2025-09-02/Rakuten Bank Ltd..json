      "text": "We revise our earnings estimates for Rakuten Bank, raising our FY3/26- FY3/28 net profit forecasts by \\(7\\% /12\\% /13\\%\\) . Previously, our earnings estimates for Rakuten Bank (like guidance) did not factor in an additional BOJ rate hike. However, we now incorporate a policy rate increase (from \\(0.50\\%\\) to \\(0.75\\%\\) ) in January 2026, as forecast by our economists. While we reflect some deposit acquisition costs due to preferential interest rates on ordinary deposits (deposit yield up 2- 3 bp qoq) introduced in July 2025, we forecast continued double- digit \\((0\\%)\\) net profit growth of \\(+36\\% / + 25\\% / + 23\\%\\) yoy for FY3/26- FY3/28. Based on the upward revisions to our earnings estimates, we raise our 12- month target price by \\(48\\%\\) to ¥8,900 (implies \\(8\\%\\) upside vs. the September 1 closing price; previous TP: ¥6,000). We continue to view Rakuten Bank as a high- quality stock with strong prospects for earnings growth and high ROE. Although the share price has risen meaningfully, we maintain our Buy rating with P/B and P/E valuations in line with global digital bank peers. Downside risks include a larger- than- expected increase in deposit yield/beta, a decline in monthly account/deposit balances, and an unexpected public offering as a move toward eliminating the parent- subsidiary listing.",

Rakuten Bank is facing rapid changes in its operating climate, including shifts in competition among online banks (changes in parent companies of competitors, financial services offered by non- financial companies through BaaS), and evolution in the deposit strategies of some megabanks and regional banks (higher time deposit rates, introduction of digital platforms for corporate customers). While it may be difficult for Rakuten Bank to come up with measures to meaningfully expand its corporate business in the next medium- term plan, we think it could consider approaches to customers outside the Rakuten ecosystem, such as the preferential interest rates introduced in July 2025. We also see scope for inorganic growth given the build- up of its capital adequacy ratio. Even if growth were to slow, we see leeway for Rakuten Bank to introduce measures to support ROE, such as starting dividend payments or share buybacks.",

While cross- selling from Rakuten Bank to the Rakuten ecosystem has been the focus in the past, the company has confirmed that the new program encourages the use of Rakuten Bank as a main account as well use of its multiple services (including by customers outside the Rakuten ecosystem).",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
