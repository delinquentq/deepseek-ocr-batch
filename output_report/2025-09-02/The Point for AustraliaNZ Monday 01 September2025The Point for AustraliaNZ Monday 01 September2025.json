This should be soft enough to all but ensure a rate cut from the Fed in September. Still, data over the last 3- 4 months have not reflected a sharp weakening in the labor market, with the chance remaining that contracting labor supply limits the increase in the unemployment rate or that hiring picks up after a period of uncertainty. But rising continuing jobless claims and a new high in consumers describing jobs as \"hard to get\" lead us to think the trend of hiring still worsened in August. Continued softening in the labor market into the fall would be a clear signal that a series of rate cuts is likely after September.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.
