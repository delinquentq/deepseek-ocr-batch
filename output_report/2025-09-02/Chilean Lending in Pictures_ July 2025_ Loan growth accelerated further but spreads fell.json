      "text": "The Chilean banking regulator released system data for July, showing loan growth acceleration and stable asset quality trends for the system and BCI. Meanwhile, Banco de Chile and Santander Chile decreased the pace of loan growth, but also with steady asset quality. Moreover, spreads fell due to further deceleration from UF inflation (- 0.2% in July from \\(+0.2\\%\\) in June). As such, net income is being impacted by weaker NII and running \\(33\\%\\) below our estimates at Banco de Chile, \\(38\\%\\) below at Santander Chile, and \\(21\\%\\) below at BCI. Indeed, NII is missing GSe by \\(27\\%\\) for Banco de Chile, \\(18\\%\\) for Santander Chile, and \\(11\\%\\) for BCI.",

Within consumer loans, credit card (+20bps to \\(9.6\\%\\) ) and installment loan growth (+40bps to \\(3.6\\%\\) ) both increased.
