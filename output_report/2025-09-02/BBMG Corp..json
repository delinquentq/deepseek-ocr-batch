For the cement operation, we expect near- term domestic cement margins to remain depressed, but we see improving visibility in execution of the industry's control on unauthorized capacity in 2026E. We expect BBMG will benefit from the broad trend, supported by its dominant market share in northern regions. We expect profit from building materials to remain depressed, amid softened demand. For property development, we expect sector profit trend to stabilize in 2026E and 2027E, but higher versus 2025E, based on presale trend and very low base in 1H25A.
