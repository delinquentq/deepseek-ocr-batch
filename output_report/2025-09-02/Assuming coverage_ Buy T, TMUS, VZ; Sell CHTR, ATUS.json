We estimate that from 2024- 2029E, there will be \\(55+\\) mn additional US fiber passings, providing a growth driver to the fiber revenues of US telcos, as well as expanding the available footprint for a converged offering, thereby improving the LTV and margins of wireless service revenue through lower churn. Unlike past offerings of convergence, we believe the US wireless and broadband bundle differs in that (a) this is a bundle of two highly demanded services, whereas converged offerings in the past usually included a lower relevant offering (e.g., POTS + broadband, video + broadband, video + mobile); (b) the value- add for consumers is a combination of a discount - as well as new product offerings only enabled by single service provider for broadband and mobile (e.g., mobile service as home internet wireless backup; and (c) broadband and wireless companies are making deeper in- roads to become a platform for additional services (e.g., streaming video, music, discounts).",

As a result, we believe that ARPU growth will become more reliant on plan migrations to premium tiers (i.e., mix), as well as contributions from services marketplaces. Among the telcos, Verizon has been leaning into the marketplace model with Perks, which is a \\(\\) 2\\$ bn annual run- rate business with mid \\(30\\%\\) margins. Notably, Verizon's Perks partnerships are telco exclusives, providing it with a near- to mid- term advantage in ARPU growth as Perks revenue grows. Charter is offering a bundle of free ad- supported streaming services (e.g., AMC+, Disney+, HBO Max, Paramount+, Peacock, Hulu, ESPN unlimited) for its video subscribers with upgrades to ad- free and the sale of these services to its broadband- only subscribers likely accretive to ARPU growth. We believe that the growing reliance by US Media companies on wholesale partnerships to drive streaming video subscriber growth, as well as the potential growth in demand for mobile AI apps and services (e.g., Google Gemini distributed through Verizon as a Perk) creates an opportunity for the wireless carriers to be a competitor to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store as the marketplace for paid apps. Beyond third- party services, we see ARPU growth opportunities through the sale of a- la- carte value- added services including data boosts (e.g., AT&T Turbo), wireless back- up, and satellite services (e.g., T- Satellite).",

The consumer experience among each of the major wireless carriers (and as a result, their MVNO customers) are of comparable high quality with select areas of geographic outperformance depending on the carrier. That said, the next several years should see growth in network traffic that could make differences in network quality more apparent. First, based on our channel checks, we see network quality advantages accruing to (1) T- Mobile, given its significant holdings of mid- band spectrum; and (2) AT&T, reflecting its industry- leading capital investment ( \\(23 - 24 bn annually in 2026- 2027) and network infrastructure (e.g., 60 mn homes passed with fiber by 2030E). In addition, AT&T and cable's (Comcast and Charter) leading wireline footprints should position them well to support tower backhaul, as well as enable those services for convergence revenue. Second, with recent legislation that restored the FCC's spectrum authority and mandated the auction of 800 MHz of spectrum within 8 years (with the first identification deadline in July 2027), we'd expect the US telecom companies will likely set aside capital for spectrum license expenditures over the next several years. Third, we believe that growing adoption of AI services and connected devices (e.g., dedicated consumer hardware for AI, Apple AI home initiatives) should be key drivers of network traffic, although we acknowledge that 5G/IOT drivers in the past have been underwhelming.",

Cable broadband technology is the market leader with about \\(62\\%\\) share of subscribers, but should lose share to fiber, which is benefiting from growing availability with fiber passings increasing by at least 55 million from 2024- 2029E, as well as its perception of being a higher quality and more reliable technology. Fixed wireless access continues to be a threat, but is likely more of a transitional technology with competitive intensity and its pace of subscriber net additions waning. The US wireless carriers all have relatively strong spectrum portfolios, with our channel checks suggesting that T- Mobile is better positioned in spectrum over the long- term. The need for continued investment into spectrum assets ahead of 6G and growing customer data requirements will likely lead to US wireless carriers preferring to maintain some financial flexibility for spectrum license purchases over the next several years, particularly given the FCC's recently renewed spectrum auction authority.",

We expect continued - albeit slowing - growth in 2025E (+8.6 million) and beyond, reflecting relatively full smartphone penetration. Industry competition has been more benign since the merger of T- Mobile and Sprint in April 2020. Although further industry consolidation (e.g., prepaid, acquisition of US Cellular by TMUS) should support rational competitive behavior, we believe that competition is increasing from benign levels - as a result of heightened promotional intensity from cable MVNOs such as Charter's Spectrum Mobile and Comcast's Xfinity Mobile, with the latter just starting to offer free lines for 1 year to its broadband subscribers.",

      "text": "Convergence, which is the offering of wireline and wireless as a bundled product, is in focus with cable and telecom companies both operating with the thesis that this bundle will become the preferred form of consumption. The ability to have a converged offering is constrained by broadband wireline passings with cable companies, AT&T, Verizon, and T- Mobile best positioned (in that order). Customers typically see convergence benefits through lower prices, while providers benefit from higher lifetime values and lower churn. First, in the US, a key benefit of convergence is combining a lower churn service (e.g., wireless phone service) with a higher churn service (wireline broadband) can help to reduce churn for both products. Second, although bundling multiple services together should improve lifetime value and reduce churn, we believe that bundling can be achieved in many ways - not just through combining wireless and broadband wireline. For instance, this can be achieved through multiple phone lines (i.e., family plans) or through additional services (e.g., Verizon Perks, wireless access for tablets & watches). Third, bundling typically drives discounts. For instance, Verizon offers an up to \\(15 / month discount for customers with both a mobile and home internet plan. Further, many of the carriers have historically offered \"4th line free\" pricing plans, with additional lines after 3 lines typically only coming with a marginal fee.",

Charter estimates these offers save consumers \\(\\sim \\$ 100\\) per month as opposed to purchasing these video applications on their own. While there is likely a limited number of consumers who want the entirety of these applications, this is an offer unlikely to be offered by the telecom companies in the near term given Charter's programming relationship with the content providers. As such, this could be a differentiated service that limits broadband customer deflections to competitors.",

First, most companies will be able to reinvest a portion of the tax savings into further building out their infrastructure. AT&T is being the most aggressive in using proceeds to invest and it will accelerate its fiber passing target by an incremental 1 mn passings per year for a total of 4 mn. This should drive accelerated fiber revenue and EBITDA growth. Second, stronger free cash flow conversion should be positive across the board for leverage metrics as well. In our view, better- than- expected cash taxes and free cash flow conversion could help accelerate already generous upcoming shareholder capital returns including accelerating buybacks from AT&T and T- Mobile over the next several years, and the start of share repurchases from Verizon.",

We estimate AAPL's iPhone revenue should grow \\(+5\\% / + 7\\%\\) in F2025/F2026 (Exhibit 59), supported by upcoming product releases (Exhibit 61). Specifically, we expect reported upcoming form factor changes over the next several years to support iPhone device demand, including the \"thinner\" iPhone 17 Air model (September 2025), a foldable iPhone 18 model (September 2026), and all- glass display on the iPhone 19 (September 2027). Accordingly, we forecast iPhone shipments to grow annually through F2028 as the annual device replacement cycle, which we estimate has grown to nearly 5.6 years as of F2025E (v. \\(\\sim 3.8\\) years F2017), begins to shorten through F2028E (4.6 years, GSe). We observe that in recent years, US carriers have offered substantial levels of device subsidies associated with switching providers or updating one's plan (Exhibit 68), which we believe has contributed to growing US user preference for premium devices over time (Exhibit 67). As such, we believe that growing demand for iPhones, across both new and existing users, supported by innovation across Apple's upcoming generations of product releases, should drive carrier market share shifts towards providers offering attractive device- related promotions.",

Fixed wireless has given the company the ability to initially expand into the broadband market, but given multiple JV fiber announcements, we think the company has broader broadband ambitions. We believe FWA still has runway for growth and we expect the company to almost double its subscriber base from 2024 to 2028, driving \\(\\sim \\$ 5bn\\) of incremental service revenue ( \\(\\sim 1 / 4\\) of total service revenue growth). At T- Mobile's Capital Markets Day in September 2024, the company forecasted it would have 12mn 5G broadband customers by 2028 vs. 7mn currently and this target was based only on using fallow spectrum capacity. If the company begins to invest for incremental capacity, which we believe has the potential to drive solid returns, this likely only increases the FWA targets.",

Verizon is the largest mobile network operator in the US, as well as a significant provider of consumer and commercial broadband access services. We're encouraged by Verizon's efforts to drive growth through continued wireless service ARPU growth through Perks, promotional amortization roll- offs, and pricing, while also benefiting from MVNO service revenue - primarily through its agreements with Comcast and Charter. In addition, we expect Verizon's growth in fiber passings from about 19 mn in 2025E to 32 mn in 2029E (v. target of 30 mn by 2028E and 35- 40 mn over time, pro- forma for the proposed acquisition of Frontier) should help drive an acceleration in Fios internet subscriber net additions. That said, we expect Verizon's post- paid phone subscriber net additions to be the slowest among the national wireless carriers over the next several years reflecting Verizon's position as the wireless market leader while facing competition from T- Mobile (lower price, network leadership), AT&T (convergence leader), and to- a- lesser extent cable (lower priced). Within Business, Verizon may see increased competition from cable following their new MVNO agreement with T- Mobile. Our Buy rating reflects what we view as heightened uncertainty and execution risks related to: 1) consumer postpaid phone net additions given increased industry competition and Verizon's relative premium pricing; 2) recent elevated levels consumer postpaid phone churn; and 3) the convergence strategy and integration risks related to the proposed Frontier acquisition but more than offset by potential upside from Frontier (if completed), Perks revenue and profitability, and capital allocation upside.

Lastly, Frontier carries significant NOLs which Verizon should be able to utilize.

Cable and fiber companies have begun instituting multi- year price locks. We think risk on the pricing front stems from 1) smaller fiber operators, 2) entry- level speed offerings are already plentiful, and 3) exploding offers. We believe the largest is from the smaller, privately owned fiber companies, as we believe these companies are likely focused on subscriber growth first and profitability growth second. Second, entry- level speed tiers have increased materially over the past few years, which we believe could reduce customers self- selecting up the speed curve. Third, cable companies have been using 'exploding' offers whereby the initial price of the service begins at \\(30 \\text{month}\\) (in the case of Charter's 100Mbps plan) and shifts to \\(50 \\text{month}\\) after the first year. We believe these promotional roll offs result in negative goodwill with customers and are likely part of the reason the cable companies have seen customer deflections to FWA and fiber over the past few years. While we haven't seen a reduction in broadband ARPUs, Charter's peer, Comcast, walked away from its broadband ARPU growth target of 3- 4% earlier this year.
