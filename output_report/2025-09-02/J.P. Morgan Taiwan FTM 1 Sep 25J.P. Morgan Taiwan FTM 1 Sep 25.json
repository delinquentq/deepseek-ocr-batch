Server margins have tracked behind expectations due to higher GB200 mix and some one- off GB200 ramping costs, which was consistent with Wistron's feedback. Looking forward, management continues to see strong Al server demand across CSPs, enterprises, and sovereign Al and has booked US \\(5.6bn\\) in new orders. Dell expects an improving Al server margin on mix shift to enterprise and sovereign Al and improving GB200/300 yields. Overall, the company has now raised full year Al server revenue guidance to US \\(20bn\\) from previous US \\(15bn+\\) with \\(50\\% /50\\%\\) 1H/2H split. This underpins our research of incremental upside to Dell and Wistron's Al server revenues in 2H25 driven by new GB300 order wins. But the low Al server margin has negative implications for other Al server brand peers and Wistron as ODM partner.",

The bright spot of the call was the company's automotive growth potential, which could be driven by a significant content increase and continued rising product adoption in both China and international customers. Also, its server business may start to see more meaningful contribution from 2026 with breakthroughs in ASIC customers/projects. Thus, we stay OW as we think investors will gradually shift focus to Silergy's longer-term outlook after reflecting on the softer near-term outlook.",
