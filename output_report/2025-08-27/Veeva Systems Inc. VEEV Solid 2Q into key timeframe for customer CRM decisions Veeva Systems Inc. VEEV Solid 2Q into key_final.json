In our view, the stock reaction is a function of elevated expectations given the magnitude of last quarter's \\(4\\%\\) revenue beat and the stock \\(+39\\%\\) YTD vs. median software \\(- 10\\%\\) . We highlight key takeaways on CRM, Iqvia and Al below. We maintain a Sell rating even in the context of Veeva's long- term moat in both Commercial and R&D, as we expect the competitive overhang in CRM to weigh on the stock over the medium term, and see a scenario where it will be challenging for Veeva to maintain its revenue growth rates over the next 3- 5 years.",
