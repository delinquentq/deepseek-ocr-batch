CrowdStrike guided to NNARR to accelerate \\(40\\%\\) yoy in 2HFY26 as it laps headwinds from last year's outage, ahead of GS/Street at \\(+29\\% / + 28\\%\\) yoy. However, 3Q revenue was \\(1\\%\\) below the Street, with CrowdStrike noting that its CCP partner rebate program gets amortized as contra revenue. We believe the key to the stock beginning to outperform again will be the company returning to a more consistent beat and raise across NNARR, revenue and EPS; which we expect will be in 1HFY26 when abnormal revenue recognition tied to concessions abate. We also look to whether CrowdStrike will be able to renew expanded Flex contracts tied to CCP at similar renewal rates to prior modules \\((>95\\%)\\) . On this visibility, CrowdStrike noted that it has been carefully tracking customer usage and rollouts for specific modules and working with customer success teams to ensure customers are getting value. Ultimately, we believe that the quality of the technology in CrowdStrike's EDR adjacencies is high, including in SIEM \\((+95\\%)\\) yoy, in Identity (where CrowdStrike focuses on next- gen threat detection and PAM overlays), and with tools like Charlotte (where CrowdStrike has put appropriate guardrails on non- deterministic technology to reduce risk in agent outcomes).",
