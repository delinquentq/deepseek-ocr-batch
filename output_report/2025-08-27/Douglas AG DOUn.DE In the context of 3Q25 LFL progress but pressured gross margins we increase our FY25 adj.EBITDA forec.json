However, despite this LFL progress, gross margin remained pressured, declining - 150bps yoy to \\(45.3\\%\\) ; thus, whilst we raise our FY25 sales growth forecast to \\(+2.6\\%\\) (from \\(+1.8\\%\\) ), we lower our GM assumption to \\(44.5\\%\\) (from \\(45.1\\%\\) ). Taken together, we increase our FY25 adj. EBITDA forecast to €770mn (from €760mn), leaving Douglas' current valuation at 7.3x FY25 PE. 12m TP remains €15, Buy rated.",
