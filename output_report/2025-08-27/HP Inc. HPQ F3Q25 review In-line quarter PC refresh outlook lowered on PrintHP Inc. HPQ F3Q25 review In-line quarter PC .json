Within Personal Systems, HPQ grew revenue \\(+6\\%\\) yoy with \\(+5\\%\\) growth in units driven by share gains in commercial (Windows 11 refresh) and premium consumer (particularly in North America and China on back- to- school). HPQ expects to see continued momentum in PC refresh into next year (MSD% industry unit growth in C2H25, growth in 2026) with over \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) of installed base converted to Windows 11, as well as continued AI PC adoption. The company guided F4Q25 PS revenue to grow similar to last year \\((+2\\%\\) qoq v. consensus \\(+3\\%\\) ) with margins solidly in- line with HPQ's target range \\((5 - 7\\%)\\) . Within Print, revenue declined \\(4\\%\\) yoy with softer demand in office against a competitive pricing environment, though home and supplies performed as expected & the company delivered strong growth in strategic areas including subscriptions & industrial graphics. HPQ guided for F4Q25 Print growth in line with last year \\((+7\\%\\) qoq v. consensus \\(+8\\%\\) ) with margins at the top end of HPQ's target range \\((16 - 19\\%)\\) , reflecting higher supplies volume & a focus on profitable units. The company expects the broader print market to decline LSD% in 2025 and 2026. Relative to last quarter \\((\\) 0.12\\(unmitigated tariff impact), HPQ was able to mitigate the majority of tariff costs in F3Q with nearly all US products now produced outside of China. HPQ will host an Investor Day in early 2026 including updates on long term targets. HPQ's F4Q25 EPS guidance of\\) 0.87- \\$0.97 implies full year EPS of \\(3.06 - 3.16,\\) 0.04 lower at the midpoint prior FY guidance for \\(3.00 - 3.30\\) of EPS, driven by a more cautious view on P1.
