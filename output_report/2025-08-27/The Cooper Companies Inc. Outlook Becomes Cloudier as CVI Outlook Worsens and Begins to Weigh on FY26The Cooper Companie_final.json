Starting with the print, sales of \\(\\) 1.06B\\((+2\\%\\) organic) were in - line to below consensus with a significant organic miss in CVI and an in - line performance in CSI as worsening trends for Clariti globally and a notable weakening in e - commerce trends across APAC. Earnings beat on the bottom by \\(\\) 0.03\\(but largely due to tax\\) (+\\) 0.02) with in - line gross margin and slightly lower operating spend driving modestly better EBITA (+20bps). With only one quarter left in the fiscal year, management nonetheless had to lower its full - year range on the top - line down to\\) \\ \\(4.076 - 4.096B\\) (+4.0- 4.5% organic), a step down from the previous \\(\\) 4.107- 4.146B\\((+5.0 - 6.0\\%\\) organic) with worse - than - expected trends across both sides of the business. With new challenges from Clariti introduced on today's call and limited visibility into how durable all the company's challenges might be, we think it's prudent to remain on the sidelines until we can see more concrete signs of stabilization.",

Cooper didn't provide concrete guidance, but previewed that it expects to grow new fits a step above market with contact lens sales growing at least in- line with the markets \\(+4 - 6\\%\\) following a stabilization in this year's destocking dynamics. CSI should also be positioned to benefit from easy comps in fertility. However, it's hard to buy into this outlook following a year that has fallen short of similarly bullish guidance. With that in mind, we're forecasting CVI growth of \\(+4\\%\\) organic in FY26 to reflect conservatism on both the broader market and competitive dynamics within it, with CSI now forecast to grow \\(+4.5\\%\\) organic off of an easy comp.",

With a lower growth outlook, tariff headwinds, and worsening price in CVI, however, we're forecasting EPS of \\(\\) 4.34\\((+6\\%)\\) next year, which reflects modest operating margin expansion of \\(+20bps\\) to \\(25.9\\%\\) and the aforementioned organic revenue growth.",
