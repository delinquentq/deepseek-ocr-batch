      "text": "KSS reported a 2Q beat and raised its FY25 guidance. While comps for the business remain muted in aggregate and sequentially decelerated vs. 1Q, we acknowledge this quarter provided some key proof points for the bull thesis - most notably the recent sequential improvement in comp each month of 2Q (and a flat July comp). Further, management noted August QTD is off to a good start and that the business has shown strength in core back- to- school categories. While KSS is still guiding for a weak comp for the year (- 4% to - 5% Y/Y), we believe management is being prudent in its assumptions amidst an uncertain consumer/macro backdrop. Key initiatives are also beginning to deliver results, including the company's proprietary brands inventory investments (+500bps sales acceleration vs. 1Q), additional queue lines (>300 stores in the quarter; +30% Y/Y increase in impulse sales), couponing adjustments, and key category initiatives such as jewelry. However, offsetting this is slower comp contribution from the Sephora business and weaker credit revenue vs. prior expectations.",

Here, management also discussed chioceful behavior from its customer base, noting ongoing pressure on the lowVand middle income consumer as they have seen those customers trade down to lower opening price point products. On tariffs, management reiterated key components of its mitigation strategy across vendor negotiations, mix shift tailwinds, and nimble buying, although lowered its FY25 gross margin guidance amidst the ongoing dynamic tariff backdrop.",

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
