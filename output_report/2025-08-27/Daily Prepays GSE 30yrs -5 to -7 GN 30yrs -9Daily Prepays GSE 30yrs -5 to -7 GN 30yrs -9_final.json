We're now two- thirds of the way through the month and our initial daily speed projections are still slower than our original aggregate projection of \\(- 1\\%\\) (Figure 1 & Figure 2). The gap is closer versus the reading from last week, however. On the turnover/lower coupon side, we're now tracking roughly \\(- 8\\%\\) , which is slightly below the \\(5\\%\\) drop we were expecting from daycount given only a slight difference in seasonals between July and August. For higher coupons, it remains to be seen how much speeds accelerate at the end of the month due to the early August drop in rates.
