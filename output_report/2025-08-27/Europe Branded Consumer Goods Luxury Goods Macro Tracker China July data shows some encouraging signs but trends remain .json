As we discussed in our Q2 wrap 21 August, the Chinese cluster performance in Q2 remained weak, but Mainland China domestic trends saw a better performance given some repatriation of spend. Key stocks: with the sector trading at 25x (ex Hermes and Brunello), our relative preference remains for LVMH (Buy- rated, on CL), which typically outperforms the industry as the cycle recovers (as discussed June 11). Additionally, for high- end exposure we prefer Buy- rated BCU and ZGN. We remain relatively cautious on the turnaround stories in a tough industry backdrop (Kering, Sell).",

For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price.
