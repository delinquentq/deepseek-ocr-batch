Recall COM patents have already expired and we est FOLD will rely on ODD 7-year regulatory exclusivity, which we est would run out in 2035 (i.e. 2028 approval + 7 years exclusivity = 2035 LOE), and (2) if FOLD can develop DMX-200 for indications beyond FSGS, which we think would make sense once IP gets extended.",

But there is indeed an upside scenario later this year if the FDA is okay with using 1 year proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval. Given the base case implies topline data in YE:27 in ALL patients, 1 year proteinuria on approx half the patients could potentially pull-forward the \"interim\" to H1:26 and all of a sudden drop a huge Phase III topline catalyst onto investors' radars. Key is - investor perception of FOLD is that there aren't major catalysts given zero pipeline, but that narrative could obviously change very quickly and investor interest flows back into the stock...",
