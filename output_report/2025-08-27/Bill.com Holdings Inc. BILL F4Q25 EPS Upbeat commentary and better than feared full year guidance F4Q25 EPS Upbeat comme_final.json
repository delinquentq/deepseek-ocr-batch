      "text": "Bottom Line: Results were solid, with BILL putting up a slight top and bottom line beat, driven by better transaction revenues that benefited both from higher take rates and higher than expected GPV. While BILL's guidance for the full year was slightly below consensus, we believe expectations were very low into the print, and shares were up after hours, which we would attribute to \"better than feared\" dynamics, as well as the balanced commentary from the company. On this note, we see a few puts and takes. On the more negative side, 1) macro is still very obviously a headwind to spending levels, impacting both GPV/customer as well as being a headwind to monetization and 2) the Spend and Expense vertical continues to absorb negative mix shift issues, driving both lower take rates from a reduction in discretionary advertising spending, as well as higher rewards as a result of mix shifting up market. However, we also thought there were a number of reasons to be positive as 1) the company is actually guiding take rates up YoY, which is the first time where the company has had line of sight to do so in many quarters, 2) the company sounds incrementally positive about the pipeline for large embedded partners, which is a positive given the recent loss in this channel as a result of the announced Xero/Melio merger (which follows the loss of Intuit and BofA in recent years), and 3) the company made the first real signs of a pivot towards managing to GAAP profitability by announcing a restructuring of stock based compensation practices, which have been a sticking point with investors for several years. While we expect the macro backdrop for SMBs and tariffs to continue to weigh on the business across several dimensions, we still see BILL as the market leader in accounts payable automation, growing the customer base at a double digit clip, with high incremental margins. While weak SSS dynamics and monetization headwinds are driving revenue growth roughly in-line with user growth at the moment, we",
