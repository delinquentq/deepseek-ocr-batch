Management noted remediation efforts for the Windham Row Harkey wells are progressing in- line with CTRA's expectations through efforts to seal off behind pipe water flow. These adjustments have resulted in improved pressure drawdown and reducing water cuts. While CTRA observed a modest oil recovery, the remediation wells are not expected to contribute meaningful incremental oil volumes to future 20 oil production guidance. Management noted that the company estimates a gradual oil recovery over time but acknowledged that original pre- drilled volumes might not be fully achieved. Further, management emphasized that the issues were localized to Windham development, with the rest of Culberson County assets not impacted. Going forward, management noted that wellbore design changes are expected to prevent similar impacts, supported by the in- line performance of 6 new Harkey wells adjacent to the affected wells brought online in 2Q25. In addition, given the changes in the oil macro outlook, CTRA increased the expected Permian Basin 2H25 rig count to 9 rigs versus 7 rigs as of 1Q25 results and versus 10 rigs as of 4Q24 results.",

CTRA guided to an increase in rig activity in the Marcellus, opting to run a second rig through 2H25. While CTRA is increasing natural gas focused activity, management emphasized that the increase is proceeding a period of no drilling in Appalachia, with the timing of the Marcellus ramp- up designed to be aligned with higher demand in the winter season. On natural gas marketing, management noted CTRA's strategy remains focused on increasing pricing diversification and enhancing realizations across the portfolio. CTRA recently announced a new power netback gas sale agreement in the Permian Basin, committing \\~50 MMcf/d to CPV Basin Ranch expected to begin in 2028 and indexed to ERCOT West pricing. While management remains positive on the potential for incremental infrastructure or project build- out in Pennsylvania, when evaluating potential longer- term contracts, management highlighted that CTRA is focused on securing differentiated pricing or differentiated end- market exposure beyond just long- term in- basin pricing.",

For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price.
