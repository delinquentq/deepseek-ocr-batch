      "text": "The 2Q earnings cycle in Business & Information Services was characterized by an intensified debate over whether Gen Al could negatively disrupt certain companies in the sector. Gartner's 2Q results, which involved a miss- and- cut, ignited investor concerns that Gen Al could replace the company's IT research and insights, sending shares \\(28\\%\\) lower as contract value growth decelerated in the quarter and was guided by management to decelerate further in the second half of the year. Gen Al concerns at Gartner spilled over to other names in the space, including CSGP, FDS, RELGB and WKLLNL. Based on takeaways from our recent 2nd annual Silicon Valley Al Field Trip, we believe sustainable moats in Business & Info Services capable of protecting from Gen Al competition include strong user sociology, i.e., having distributed users, power users and embedded workflows that make the product sticky, and proprietary data that cannot be replicated or produced by LLMs. We see Gartner - down \\(49\\%\\) YTD - as oversold given its research and insights are proprietary and cannot be reliably or closely substituted by LLMs. We also believe SPGI is favorably leveraged to Gen Al given assistant and agentic capabilities being incorporated into its products, and its proprietary data. IRM's data center business should additionally benefit from rising Gen Al infrastructure capex to support growing inference needs as enterprise adoption of Gen Al increases.",

Gartner's decelerating CV growth in 2Q and overall miss- and- cut results sparked a broader debate in Business Services on which companies are Gen Al winners and losers. Many investors are concerned that Gartner's research and insights can be replaced by LLMs. Those concerns spread to other companies in Business Services such as CSGP, FDS and several European Business Services names including RELGB and WKLNL. Ultimately, we believe having proprietary data generated in- house is one of the best sustainable moats for Info Services companies in the face of potential competition from Gen Al. Companies that we believe will be disrupted by Gen Al include staffers RHl and MAN that face threats not only from a decline in lower tier white collar staffing volumes but also from Gen Al native competitors that may be able to match employers and job candidates better than labor- based recruiters. Gen Al also represents a risk for HRB, in our view, since DIY competitors leveraging LLMs to offer tax support and insights reduces the value proposition of human- assisted tax prep services, and note the tax code is publicly available for free to train LLMs and taxes by design are rote and procedural. In contrast, SPGI, MCO, TRI and VRSK should benefit from Gen Al as agentic workflows can automate multi- step tasks such as credit memo generation and SwOT analysis, reducing tasks that take days to hours. These companies also have proprietary data, are embedded into existing workflows and have brand authority that serve as sustainable competitive moats.",

During the 2Q earnings cycle, companies for the most part reaffirmed their full- year guidance, despite the outperformance in the quarter, to account for ongoing macro uncertainty. Of the companies that changed their full- year outlook, more companies raised their guide than lowered it, reflecting the flow- through of outperformance in the quarter or FX. With respect to revenue, 10 companies reaffirmed their full- year guide (ADT, BV, BCO, CLVT, FDS, FICO, MCO, NATL, TRI, ULS), 7 companies raised their full- year guide (BFAM, CSGP, EFX, IRM, SPGI, TRU, VRSK) and 2 companies lowered their full- year guide (IT, KLC) – out of those that provide full- year guidance. The revenue guidance cut at IT was due to reduced federal government spending and tariff headwinds, and at KLC was due to lower occupancy rates.

Our target multiple is at a premium to the median multiple of self-grader and industrial REIT peers reflecting IRM&#x27;s attractive organic growth trends as the company&#x27;s growth portfolio continues to expand, mitigated by transformation in a legacy records management company into a data and technology company that comes with execution risk and medium-term financial uncertainty.Competing technologies in records management, acquisition integration risk, financial leverage and FX risk.KLCKinderCareBuy$7.20$208.3x NTM + 1YR EBITDA of $379mn, forecast NTM average net debt of $736mn and forecast NTM shares outstanding of 120mn. Our target multiple comes at a discount to the broader Business Services peer group median to account for KLC&#x27;s lack of public market track record execution and higher leverage than its peers.Plateauing of occupancy rates, structural issues in bottom quintile centers, structurally reduced demand for on site child care services with an increase in work-from-home, starting constraints, wage inflation and financial leverage.KFYKorn FerryBuy$75.09$8514.5x NTM + 1YR EPS of $5.83. Our target multiple is in-line with the staffing peer median NTM P/E due to structural advantages enabling market share gains from cross-selling and more resilient revenue performance given a diversified business mix, mitigated by headwinds from the pro-cyclical executive search, RPO and professional search &amp; interim businesses.Macroeconomic headwinds, competitive threats, acquisition integration risk and FX risk.MANManpowerGroupSell$41.83$396.8x NTM + 1YR EPS of $5.72.

Our target multiple represents a discount to the Business Services peer group median to reflect NATL&#x27;s lower revenue growth, slightly lower EBITDA margins, higher financial leverage and lower FCF conversion from EBITDA.(-) An economic recession, revenue headwinds from the continued shift from cash to digital payments, bank branch consolidation and mixed execution on the ATMaaS model. (+) Increase in cash usage, improvement in macro conditions, bank branch transformation to self-service and the successful migration to an ATMaaS model.RHIRobert HalfSell$36.84$3411.0x NTM + 1YR EPS of $3.09.

Our target multiple represents a premium to the Business Services peer group median to reflect ROL&#x27;s higher revenue growth, higher EBITDA margins, attractive scale and route density, healthy balance sheet, and strong track record of execution.Potential market loss if the acquisition of TMX by RTO creates a well-integrated scaled competitor in the US, adverse weather or climate changes that could reduce pest activity, a shortage of labor supply or rising labor costs, supply chain disruptions, environmental safety and acquisition integration risks.ULSUL SolutionsNeutral$63.20$6916.5x NTM + 1YR EBITDA of $856mn, forecast NTM average net debt of $164mn and forecast NTM shares outstanding of 203mn. Our target multiple comes at a premium to European TIC peer group median reflecting strong execution as a new public company, robust Industrial growth trends and improving efficiencies, partially mitigated by its lower FCF conversion from EBITDA compared to peers.(-) Macro and geopolitical uncertainty, premium pricing relative to competitors, elevated investments into growth initiatives that could limit the pace of future margin expansion and FX.

No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
