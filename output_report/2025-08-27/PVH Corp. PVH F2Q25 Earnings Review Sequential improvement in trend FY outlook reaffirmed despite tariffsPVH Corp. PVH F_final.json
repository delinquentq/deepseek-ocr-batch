      "text": "PVH reported a 2Q beat and reiterated its FY operational guidance. Revenues sequentially improved each month of the quarter, and growth was healthy across regions and brands (albeit partly driven by a wholesale timing shift). By brand, management highlighted continued momentum in core categories like underwear and denim at CK, while Tommy drove strong commercial impact through sport and seasonal activations (F1 movie/SailGP/Hilfiger Resort). On margins, results were better than expected, with strong cost controls more than offsetting gross profit pressures associated with promotions, license transitions, unfavorable mix, tariffs, and freight costs. While inventories grew \\(+13\\%\\) Y/Y, this marks a sequential improvement vs. 1Q at \\(+19\\%\\) . Within this, management noted 1pt of Y/Y increase was attributed to higher costs related to tariffs, and the balance of the increase was driven by early receipts of core bestselling products, with management reiterating confidence in inventory / sales alignment by year- end. Looking ahead, management reiterated their FY25 operational guidance despite incremental tariff headwinds and planned increase in marketing investments in 2H25.",
