We see downside in margins though as supply opens up. The interplay of these two factors will be a key driver of medium- term earnings; 2) House prices - Australian house prices have enjoyed a boom during Covid driven by global stimulus and ultra- low rates. A significant reversal in median house prices (the negative wealth effect) would be highly detrimental to demand for new vehicles. This remains a key risk on exiting covid; 3) Disruptive business models - These would include ride- sharing / short- term rental business models; direct- to- retail customer business models; and online business models impacting volumes sold and serviced by traditional auto retailers; 4) Shift to EVs away from ICE vehicles being accelerated by government policy; and 5) Change to certain OEM traditional channels to market with a move from a franchise model to an agency model, which has created some uncertainty.",
