We use a PE valuation as it is a market standard and EV/EBITDA as its valuation metric as this is frequently used in the global healthcare sector to compare companies with different gearing and taxation levels. Upside risks to our price target include better- than- expected growth in the Australian hospital markets, greater- than- expected synergies from the Capio acquisition and the Ascension JV. Downside risks to our price target include growing government pressure to lower growth of premiums in Australia, which could have an impact on prosthetic lists, and hence a potential impact on Ramsay, as well as margin compression in the UK and French businesses due to further government reimbursement cuts.",
