Unit COGS for mined copper (weighted by products) was RMB24.4k/t in 2Q,+1.2% QoQ/+8.8% YoY (+6.6% vs 2024 whole year). Earlier this year, mgmt communicated that lower grade, longer logistics etc can lead to higher cost, and thus it's not entirely a surprise.Unit COGS for mined gold (weighted) saw higher increase to RMB272/q, +8.2% QoQ/+17.8% YoY. Besides what mentioned above, it also resulted from a combination of 1) higher gold royalty due to price surge and 2) relatively high cost in Akyem and La Arena during operation transition. Mgmt expect unit gold COGS to decrease sequentially in 2H25. For La Arena, the company has bought electric mining trucks to replace the few pre-existing trucks, to improve utilization at processing plants and thus reduce unit overhead; for Akyem, the company is re-evaluating operation model to extend open-pit operation period from 2027 currently to 2044,which will also significantly reduce unit overhead. On whole year basis, mgmt guides 5-8% unit cost increase in 2025 for both mined copper and gold.",

Zijin's previous 2025 guidance of 1.15mt can be hard to achieve as a result, and we expect copper output to be largely flat YoY at 1.07mt instead, but we do not see significantly impact to the company's bottom line thanks to its diversified asset portfolio globally (earlier note here). Mgmt acknowledges it takes time to bring full Kamoa back on due to damage to the mining area. From Zijin's perspective, there is quite some room for improvement;e operation management, technical design etc, and they are working to find a way out. Other copper projects under Zijin's control are progressing as scheduled, incl Julong phases (Commission around 2025 year-end), caving method at Timok and Tongshan, etc.",
