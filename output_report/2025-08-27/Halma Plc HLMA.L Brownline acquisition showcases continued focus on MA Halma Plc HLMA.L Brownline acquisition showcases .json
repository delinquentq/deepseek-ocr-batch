      "text": "Yesterday (26 Aug), Halma announced the completed acquisition of Brownline B.V., a provider of advanced gyroscopic locating systems used in underground drilling, for €150m cash (c.129m). This places the deal among the group's top three acquisitions by consideration to date and showcases Halma's continued focus on M&A, a central pillar of the group's growth strategy that we reviewed at length in our 6th August initiation note. With this acquisition, Halma has committed c. 2bn of capital across 95 acquisitions over the last 20 years, funded out of FCF. Yet, despite this consistent M&A track record, acquisition forecasts appear absent from most consensus contributions. We believe a key distinction between our forecasts and consensus is therefore our modeling of generic M&A, as set out in our recent initiation. Looking ahead, we expect HSD OSG to be enhanced with this continued M&A. We believe the group's formula for growth is simple but sustainable and therefore warrants a premium multiple. Our target price implies c.13% upside and 23.6x 12m forward EV/EBIT, a 52% premium to Multi- Industry vs. 65% historically.",

      "text": "Brownline has been acquired from PE firm Mentha and will operate as a standalone company within Halma's Environmental and Analysis segment. Brownline's solutions help construction teams drill underground without needing to dig up roads or use bulky equipment such as above- ground beacons, while maintaining a high level of accuracy. This makes it less environmentally disruptive, easier and faster to install critical infrastructure in densely populated urban environments. With its unique focus on minimally disruptive power cable and fibre installation using underground drills, Brownline shares few technological overlaps with the other businesses within the Halma group. However, given the international focus on the energy transition and infrastructure resilience, we believe this new asset will provide exposure to high growth end- markets, underpinned by the group's strategy to build and maintain technological leadership in niches with structural growth drivers.",

In the last ten financial years (FY15- FY25), Halma has committed an average c.150m p.a. in cash to acquisitions, which have added an average \\(+3.4\\%\\) annually to the group's sales growth. We update our FY26E forecasts to include the £129m cash consideration for the Brownline acquisition. In this transaction, Halma paid c.4x EV/sales. As a consequence, this increases our FY26/27E sales forecasts by \\(0.7\\% /1.2\\%\\) . We also expect Brownline to support an improved margin profile for E&A, thereby driving \\(1.2\\% /1.2\\%\\) increases in our FY26/27E adj. EBIT for the group. Following the acquisition, we expect the group's leverage to remain within the \\(0.3x - 0.6x\\) range for FY26- 28E.",
