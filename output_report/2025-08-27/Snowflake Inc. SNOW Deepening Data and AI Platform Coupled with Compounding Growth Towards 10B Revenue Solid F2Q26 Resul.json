We see the company's narrative evolving to reflect a strong position in core Data Analytics (still inflecting amidst cloud transition), improving product positioning, and AI execution. By emphasizing several new products (Cortex AISQL for analytical users; Snowflake Intelligence for the broader business users; expansion within the Data Integration market via Openflow; SnowConvert AI catalyzing legacy data warehouse migration; Gen2 architecture delivering 2x faster performance), the company is poised to cement its technological leadership while strengthening its leadership as an easy- to- use platform for end- users. We highlight that Snowflake has an opportunity to be a Gen- AI platform, enabling customers to develop agentic applications using Cortex AISQL. Additionally, Snowflake Connect for Apache Spark has the potential to open up new data science workloads and expand the TAM opportunity. Notably, Product Revenue acceleration was driven not only by AI but also by the core data platform. Moreover, AI is becoming a force multiplier for the business. Improving consumption trends with robust adoption within the base (powering \\(25\\%\\) deployed use- cases) and driving new logo momentum (50% of net adds in 2Q). All in, we believe that core reacceleration, coupled with strengthening AI positioning, sets Snowflake up for solid performance ahead that should warrant a premium multiple even relative to best- in- class",

As we have seen dominant vendors emerge in SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS, we believe Snowflake is well positioned to capitalize on the shift in data and database to the cloud, which remains in relatively early stages. We believe Snowflake will continue to replace incumbent warehousing solutions owing to its scalable and elastic cloud native data platform, while also capitalizing on net new workloads and use cases as DX drives greater digitization within the enterprise, and business intelligence (BI) and analytics remains a top priority for spending. Moreover, while we believe the company's current large and rapidly growing TAM provides runway for continued expansion, we see opportunity for Snowflake to continue to expand its addressable market as the platform's scalability, ease of use, and efficiency enable new use cases like secure data sharing through the company's data exchange.",

The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for specific metrics for each stock. The normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may vary depending on the fiscal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows:",
