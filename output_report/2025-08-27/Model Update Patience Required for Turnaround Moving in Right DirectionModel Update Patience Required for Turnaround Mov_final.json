As a result, Q3 SG&A will delver ~75bps, which we believe was a surprise and a NT frustration point for investors who have been waiting for further OM% expansion and more consistent flow-through.

Headwinds will include tariffs rolling through 1H (now &lt;50% mitigation offset in '25 due to higher rates, but more in '26) and a larger G-III license take back (50bps ahead within this year to GM%), offset in part by lapping CK platform costs and incremental cost savings. An offset to higher G-III takeback will be outsourcing to other partners, such as with otherwear to Herman Kay. We continue to appreciate mgmt's focus on reigniting brand momentum, and view sales improvements as encouraging for eventual P/E upside.We also look to the elevation of CK as a positive, such as the opening of more full-price stores and return to runway next month.
