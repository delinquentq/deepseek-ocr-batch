      "text": "PT to DKK 880, Remain Sell rated. Pandora released its 2Q25 on the 15th of August, with organic sales growth and EBIT in line with Visible Alpha Consensus Data. Given the context of the tough macro environment and external headwinds (commodity costs/fx/tariffs - 230bp drag on EBIT margin in Q2), we believe Pandora is executing strongly with the group's growth outlook and margin ambition for FY25 reiterated (includes 4- 5% LFL growth, 7- 8% organic growth with an EBIT margin of c.24%). However, for FY26, whilst management continues to expect an EBIT margin of c.25% excluding tariffs, it now moves to a level of \"at least 24%\" in 2026, including tariffs. In terms of the trading performance in the current quarter, management indicated that July had decelerated with LFL growth at \"around 2%\" and that August (first two weeks) had started similarly. Post LFL of 4.5% in H125 (+6% Q1, +3% Q2), to deliver the FY25 ambition of 4- 5% LFL implies a magnitude of c.5% is needed in H225 (to reach the mid point of the range). Whilst management highlighted new products are to arrive towards the end of Q3 for the important gifting season, we look for 2% LFL in H225 (was 4%) which sees 3% LFL FY25E. Updating our forecasts post 2Q25 and for the updated margin commentary, we lower our EBIT forecast by - 3% FY25 and - 6% FY26. We remain Sell rated.",

Whilst new product launches will commence at the end of Q3, we think this looks optimistic given commentary that LFL in July/early August was tracking c.2% (and given price increases of mid- single digit, implies low- single- digit volume pressure). In terms of operating profitability, Pandora continues to look for a c.24% EBIT margin in FY25 while expecting an additional 60bps headwind from tariffs with additional tailwinds from pricing. In FY26, management expects headwinds to be 120bps and now looks for an EBIT margin of 'at least' 24% in FY26 (was c.25% but this excluded a potential tariff impact), which is broadly in line with consensus forecasts (Visible Alpha Consensus EBIT margin FY25/26E 23.9%/24.2%; GSe 23.6%/23.8%).",
