The magnitude of the price increase will be set on a brand- by- brand basis to reflect the mechanics of the tariff (transfer price, distribution channel and the margin of retailers) rather than using the price positioning of each brand (i.e. entry - high end and relative price elasticity). The timing of the price increase was not confirmed at this stage, and management indicated it is required and ready to disclose this to the market two weeks prior to implementation. Overall, Swatch Group is not expecting any adverse impact on US demand from price increases and, given recent weakness in USD (vs CHF), the pricing of product will continue to be within the benchmark range the group prefers to maintain for the pricing of products abroad when indexed to the domestic currency (using current spot, the USD has weakened \\(10\\%\\) vs CHF since April 1st).",
