Specifically, the price adjustments management implemented in May and June will drive these higher sales, as they are pleased with the elasticity results and are seeing lower unit degradation from the consumer.

Management believes that their merchandising and supply chain efficiencies will continue to accelerate transaction growth in 3Q, as they are in a strong inventory position for Fall and Halloween. However, we note that this guidance remains unchanged for 4Q, as management is still guiding towards a +LSD comp range given the potential consumer uncertainty and competitive environment. We note that this guidance could be conservative given the acceleration in the business and management's plans for the holiday season. Specifically, management called out a strong in- stock inventory prepared for holiday, leaning into key holiday winners from last year, and chasing trending product such as lounge, decor, and stocking stuffers.",
