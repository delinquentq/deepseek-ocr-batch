The margin expansion coming through from resident was in line but driven by better - than - expected risk equalisation outcomes. 2H25 claims inflation improved to 2.1% vs. 1H25 of 2.3% with guidance of 2.6% to 2.9% for FY26 (based on agreed FY25 indexation against rate of - 4% for the most part of FY26 suggesting perhaps margin stability into FY26).",
