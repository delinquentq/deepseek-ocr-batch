FY26 guidance however in our view reflects margin accretion, adjusting for the impact of declining profitability of RHC's public work, (2) Insight into the materiality of RHC's public work with the revised Jondalup public hospital agreement representing a drag of \\(\\sim 600\\) bps to FY26 growth (vs pcp). We view this segment of RHC's earnings as lower quality given RHC's limited pricing power with state governments relative to private insurers, (3) Ramsay Sante outperformed with RHC progressing its evaluation of strategic options relating to its \\(52.8\\%\\) shareholding.

The increase in utilization (300bps 4Q25 vs pcp) is a step in the right direction. This trajectory however is set to be challenged by a significant decline in profitability from state funded work with the 1H26 result potentially providing better clarity to assess the materiality to earnings from RHC's public case mix. The digital & data scope has been reduced with RHC reducing \\(\\sim 50\\) heads in this team.

The aging demographic and lagging public hospital capacity investment in our view will support long term organic growth for the private hospital sector. Overcapacity in the private sector however has weighed on operator profitability and as supply normalises, we forecast RHC's earnings margins to improve from volume leverage, supporting our long- term valuation for the business.
