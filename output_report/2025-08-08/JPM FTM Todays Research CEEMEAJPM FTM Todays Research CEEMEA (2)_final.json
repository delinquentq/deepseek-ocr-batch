The growth of the online and discounter channels, acknowledged as a threat by Othaim during the 2Q25 results call, is prompting a reevaluation of store growth strategies among offline retailers while rising personnel and lease costs dampen profitability prospects. We continue to favor Spinneys in the MENA food retail space given its exposure to the UAE, where market dynamics are more favorable and where we see business model differentiation and strong competitive moat; its expansion into Kuwait presents additional upside potential. We continue to find valuations elevated for Alothaim & BinDawood (18- 22 P/Es for JPMc 3- 7% EPS CAGR in 2025- 27E) and believe that Spinneys offers a better risk- reward.",
