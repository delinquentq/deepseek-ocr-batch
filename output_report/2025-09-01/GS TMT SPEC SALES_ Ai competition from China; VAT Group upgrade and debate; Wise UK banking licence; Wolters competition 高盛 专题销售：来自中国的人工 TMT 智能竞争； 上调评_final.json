Software - big negative inflection in Sentiment early in the month, despite only modest fundamental downticks during 2Q EPS season (lead- gen / top of funnel - per MNDY ... extended sales cycles - per BL or VERX). Bearish price action around early month earnings really set the tone (HUBS, DT, DDOG types) as AI anxiety crept in - - namely arguments that AI a disruptive force that changes (cannibalizes) pricing models, lowers the barrier to entry for new entrants, and ultimately compresses the profit pool available to leading SaaS incumbents .... Finally, some reprieve by month end with positive EPS related price action at the data / security layer (CRWD, MDB, SNOW), helped stabilize the narrative into a VERY busy month of Software analyst days & user conferences in September (15+ events)",

Notable highlights during the month include: 1) Consensus expectation for Hynix 2026 HBM pricing came down a bit but still more positive than our view, 2) Nanya revenue showed notable acceleration in yoy growth as the revenue starts to reflect exponential DDR4 pricing growth, and 3) server ODM and Aspeed revenue yoy growth continued to be strong but showed deceleration.  \n- TrendForce's view on 3Q25 pricing growth (conventional DRAM: +10-15% qoq, blended DRAM: +15-20% qoq) is largely unchanged, which remains more positive than our view for the Korean memory companies (conventional DRAM: +HSD% qoq, blended DRAM: +low-teens% qoq).
