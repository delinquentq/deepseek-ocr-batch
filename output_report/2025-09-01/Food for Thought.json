Starbucks, which debuted the iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte 22 years ago, launched its fall menu on 8/26, slightly later than the last two years (8/22 in 2024, 8/24 in 2023, 8/30 in 2022, 8/24 in 2021, 8/25 in 2020, 8/27 in 2019, 8/28 in 2018 and first week of September prior). Many peers have also launched their fall lineups, including Dunkin' (first launch 8/20; second drop 10/15), Tim Hortons (8/28), Peet's Coffee (8/20), Dutch Bros (8/22), McDonald's (8/29), The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (8/20), and Caribou Coffee (8/21). Starbucks is also planning to launch Protein next month, which we suspect could come on 9/23 (as part of a second fall drop), including Protein Cold Foam and a Protein Latte. We note Tim Hortons launched a new protein beverage lineup this week.",

Deutsche Bank provides liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have shorter- term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer- term ratings. Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/), and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high- conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near- term or medium- term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12- month view of total return or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company- specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals.

Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors.

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within the Deutsche Bank Group.
