Despite the marginal rise, the manufacturing PMI has remained below 50 for five months since the tariff blitz in April, with persistent weakness in new export orders. Meanwhile, the continued rise in the price indices reflects the intensifying campaign against low- price competition, which could dampen investment and output activity. The improvement in the non- manufacturing PMI was primarily driven by capital market services, buoyed by the recent stock market rally, while retail sales and property sectors have remained a drag.

Daily average stock trading volume soared to a record high of RMB2.3trn in August, but its positive spillovers to the real economy might be quite limited. Chinese households' assets are still concentrated in property, while the salaries of financial practitioners remain largely capped. The rising growth headwinds call for more policy support, but deploying pro- growth measures might risk causing a stock market bubble. In our view, Beijing's best strategy is to draw lessons from the past, resist the temptation to fuel the stock markets through high- profile monetary measures in the near term, remain vigilant by avoiding contractionary policies, clean up the property mess, and address some deep- rooted problems such as the unequal social security system.",

This was likely driven by the launch of the JS- SEZ in January, thanks to initiatives to expedite the approval process and incentives to attract investors.

However, barring the huge miss on the JV and associates share contribution (due to our FY25E forecasts being significantly high at MYR400mn), we think the shortfall would be made up for in 2HFY25E on the back of the recent revision in the scheduled tariff across the board (refer to link), lower opex (typically frontloaded) and the strengthening of MYR against the USD (which would lower finance costs).",
