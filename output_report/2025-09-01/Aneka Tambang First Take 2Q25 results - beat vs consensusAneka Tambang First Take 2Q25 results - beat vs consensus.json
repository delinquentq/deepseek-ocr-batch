The result is in line with our 2Q estimates following the announcement of the operational data, but is still a large beat compared to street estimates (see here for 2Q estimates & 2Q operational data). Key highlights of the results were 1) better- than- expected nickel ore pricing, highlighting the strong demand for \\(>1.7\\%\\) Ni grade over lower grade ore for blending purposes, and 2) lower- than- expected gold margins (2Q gold margins at \\(5.4\\%\\) vs us expecting \\(\\sim 6.5\\%\\) ). ANTM's share price has underperformed JCI by \\(8\\%\\) in the last 3 months, as concerns on lower gold volumes in 3Q are being discounted by the street. As a context, we expect gold sales volumes to materially decline in 3Q due to ANTM halting its gold imports (initial readthrough abt \\(- 60\\% q / q\\) ), but we expect a recovery to ensue in 4Q as ANTM signs an agreement to take Freeport's unrefined gold. Net- net, we believe the 3M underperformance creates a good opportunity to buy the stock and we do not see downside risk to our \\(28\\%\\) higher- than- street estimates for FY25E as 1) we expect gold sales to recover in 4Q and 2) nickel ore prices have trended materially above our expectations.",
