Management's focus on deleveraging and ensuring operational safety remains intact, with targets to reduce the overall debt balance (Exhibit 2) to c.Rmb145bn by end- 25 (Rmb5bn higher than prior guidance), and to achieve an ideal debt level of c.Rmb100bn in the longer- run. Net debt reduction is expected to moderate to below Rmb10bn p.a. going forward, after peaking at c.Rmb60bn in 2025.",

Looking into 2026 and beyond, management indicated confidence to achieve its ideal debt level of c.Rmb100bn, based on a gross repayment of approximately Rmb20bn/20bn/10bn/9bn/5bn for 2026-2030 (vs. c.Rmb60bn in 2025) and net repayment of below Rmb10bn p.a. going forward (vs. c.Rmb30bn in 2025).",
