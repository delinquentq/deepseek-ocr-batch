KBank is in the midst of a rare increase in shareholding from an unrelated party, which appears unsolicited.

We forecast \\(\\sim 70\\%\\) average cash payout (including special) in 2025- 27, with an additional \\(\\sim 15\\%\\) of 2026- 27 profits being used for buybacks. This adds up to \\(8 - 12\\%\\) total yield on the stock in 2025- 27, with a high degree of visibility. KTB should get a boost of \\(\\sim 19\\%\\) of profits this year (most likely) from Thai Air listing, part of which should be paid out this or next year.

KBank is our top pick, as cash DPS yield is highest for the stock for 2025- 26. Interim DPS of Bt2 was in- line with our forecasts and a positive surprise for the Street. KTB is a close second. As soon as BoT/SEC revise the buyback regulations, the bank should start the process. This should be a meaningful catalyst for the stock. BBL offers deep value, with a possibility of capital management, but probability of such an action remains low. SCB has already optimized payout at \\(80\\%\\) . Almost similar for Tisco.",

We believe TTB did not conduct enough buybacks earlier. In the year, which led to the bank missing the budget. To be fair, there are quite a few clauses regarding buybacks, spread across various regulations. This limits nimbleness in execution. Our analysis (Fig. 13) shows that the bank was able to figure the limitations in course of the year, and increased buybacks to a pace of \\(21\\%\\) of daily volumes since May- 25 (vs \\(7.5\\%\\) in Feb- Apr). We expect Bt8/6.3bn in buybacks in 2026/27. Yet, the pause for next 6M, and eventual end of tax- related benefits by FY27 limits RoE/DPS visibility beyond a point.",

KBank is our top pick, as the cash DPS yield is highest for the stock for 2025- 26. The interim DPS of Bt2 was in- line with our forecasts and a positive surprise for the Street. KTB is a close second. As soon as BoT/SEC revise the buyback regulations, the bank should start the process. This should be a meaningful catalyst for the stock, in our view. BBL offers deep value, with a possibility of capital management, but we believe the probability of such an action remains low. SCB has already optimized the payout at \\(80\\%\\) .

A six- month cooling off period is now in place, which means the buyback can only start in Feb- 26. We believe TTB did not conduct enough buybacks earlier in the year, which led to the bank missing the budget. To be fair, the rules and regulations regarding buybacks have quite a few clauses, which limits nimbleness on execution. Our analysis (Figure 13) shows that the bank was able to figure the limitations in the course of the year, and increased buybacks to a pace of \\(21\\%\\) of daily volumes since May- 25, but that pace was not enough to use up the quota. We expect Bt8/6.3bn in buybacks in 2026/27. Yet, the pause for the next 6M, and eventual end of tax- related benefits by FY27 limits visibility on RoE/DPS. At \\(0.743 \\cdot 25\\) PB for \\(6.3\\%\\) core RoE (8.3% headline RoE), we see the stock as fully valued. Hence, we downgrade to Neutral.",

The stock lacks immediate catalysts and appears fairly valued at current valuations of \\(6.4x / 0.52x\\) 25 JPM e PE/PB.- From here, a recovery in Thailand's investment cycle will be key for BBL's loan and earnings growth, which we still expect to be a while away.- We forecast DPS of Bt9/9.50/10 based on a payout of 37-41% over 2025-27 (36% payout in 2024 with DPS of Bt8.50). At current levels, this equals 5.8-6.4% dividend yields, which are the lowest within our Thai bank coverage. Any possibility of capital management should lead to a sharp re-rating.- The bank has one of the largest LLR buffers in the region ( \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) LLR/Loans). Our calculations suggest that excess LLR should add c.30% to BVPS, after adjusting for potential delinquencies. This, along with a low retail portfolio (10-12% of mix), offers comfort on the bank's asset quality.- Permata should contribute \\(\\sim 16 - 17\\%\\) to group profits over 2025-27E, with a 12-14% contribution to group assets. This growth premium should lead to a narrowing of the valuation discount for the stock which showed up post the Permata transaction in 2019.- We think BBL's high capital buffers will allow the bank enough leeway to grow as credit demand picks up. Further, the bank should be the biggest beneficiary of a pick-up in Thailand's investment cycle.",

Hence, we expect the bank to use capital management as a tool. Accordingly, we forecast dividends (regular and special) to move up, driving stock upside. We expect a higher total dividend payout ratio (including special) of \\(67 - 75\\%\\) , with total DPS of Bt13.5/15.5/16.5 over 2025-27, respectively.- It does not appear that a share buyback is being actively considered at this time, though that remains a possibility, in our view. RWA growth at the bank is limited, which would lead to consistent capital accumulation. At the current juncture, with nominal GDP growth for the country running at \\(-3\\%\\) and growth guidance at \\(3 - 5\\%\\) , it is quite difficult to build a scenario where the retained capital can be used to deliver significant balance sheet growth, that too in a commercial manner.- The recently announced restructuring scheme offers visibility on asset quality holding up for 12-24 months. We forecast credit costs of 165/140bps in 2025/26, vs 190bps in 2024. This is a touch above mgm guidance of normalised provisions of 140-160bps.- SME loans comprise \\(15\\%\\) of assets now, down from \\(30\\%\\) 15 years ago. Further, the bank has unwound low RoRWA businesses in the past two years (high-yield consumer finance), which lends credence to the outlook for improving asset quality.- The CASA franchise for KBank \\((80\\%)\\) is due to its strong branch network and best-in-class mobile application (KPLUS). However, the inability to lower CASA rates further poses NIM risks in an interest rate cut environment.- KBank's measured approach to digital changes gives us confidence in its ability to execute the digital strategy. The bank is well positioned in terms of its tech stack, product offerings, as well as building investments in the Web 3.0 space. However, these shifts will take time to show up in the bottom line.",

Adjusted for buybacks, the stock offers \\(7 - 10\\%\\) yields over 2025-27. \n- Ahig CET1 of \\(18.5\\%\\) , low RWA growth and \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) ROE over the next 2-3 years suggest the possibility of better-than-expected capital management at KTB. We forecast payout ratio of \\(45 / 60 / 60\\%\\) over 2025-27, with DPS of Bt1.67/1.83/2.06 (2024: Bt1.55/49.3% payout). We are also factoring in a share buyback of \\(\\sim \\mathrm{Bt14bn}\\) (4% of the existing shares) spread over 2H25-2027. \n- The bank has the second-highest LLR/Loans within the sector at \\(6.5\\%\\) , and NPL coverage of \\(183\\%\\) . This, coupled with a relatively lower-risk balance sheet and likelihood of recovery from a large travel-related account, offers comfort on asset quality. SME loans have declined (11% now vs \\(22\\%\\) in 2015), while gov't SOE loans have increased (20% now vs \\(9\\%\\) in 2021). \\(\\sim 90\\%\\) of unsecured loans (22% of book) are payroll-linked, hence should be relatively low-risk. \n- Tourism recovery may lead to a potential upgrade of travel-related borrowers to stage 1 from stage 3 in the next 12 months. This should boost NPL coverage, which is high at \\(183\\%\\) vs the medium-term guidance of \\(130 - 140\\%\\) . This is the underlying logic for our credit cost forecasts of \\(120 / 90 / 80\\) bps over 2025/26/27. \n- The government has partnered with KTB to run the largest open digital platform called \"Paotang\". The app has \\(\\sim 40\\mathrm{nm}\\) users (vs \\(\\sim 54.1\\mathrm{nm}\\) adult population). The data is owned by the government, but KTB can cross-sell with customer consent. Furthermore, the merchant app called Tung Ngern has 1.7mn users; also government-supported. These partnerships have allowed KTB to increase usage of its own app (KTB Next, KTB Connext) to 16mn-18mn users, allowing quick and efficient scale-up. Furthermore, the bank is engaging with select private-sector players to improve middleware, STPs and other tech architecture, as well as start digital lending. These measures have led to better PPoP, and should continue to do so, in our view.",

Accordingly, we expect the stock to trade on a dividend yield based valuation framework. We forecast DPS of Bt10.73/10.83/11.51 for 2025- 27, which equates to 8.3- \\(9\\%\\) yield. From here, the onus is on SCBx to prove that the bank is a better underwriter and is in a better position to deliver longer- term growth (Gen2/Gen3). There are two sources of asset quality risks: (1) lingering write- offs from CardX and AutoX; and (2) weakness in the bank's restructured consumer credit (loans under 'You Fight We Help'), especially as SCBx has a large presence in the segment. Gen2 provisions are running meaningfully above \\(\\sim 600\\) bps (790bps as of 2Q25), the level the bank considers normalized for this cohort, given the higher- yield nature of the book.",

We expect the bank to continue paying out Bt7.75 DPS over 2025-27 (92-97% payout), which limits the upside to the current stock price.- Tisco has been able to deliver consistent earnings growth in the past decade. This is despite meaningful shifts in the auto cycle, interest rate cycles and GDP growth. Over the next 12 months, we expect loan growth to stay low at the bank, driving mid-single digit PPoPg. This, along with normalisation in credit costs (we expect 33bps increase in 2025 to 95bps), will limit EPSg, and hence the re-rating of the stock.- High concentration in the auto sector (61% of loan mix including HP and title loans) exposes Tisco to idiosyncratic risks. This is weighing on Tisco's asset quality, driving our credit cost forecasts of 95-100bps over 2025-27. A faster-than-anticipated increase in auto title loans could result in higher-than-expected credit costs at the bank.",

With relatively better AQ and slower loan (and RWA) growth, the bank has announced a share buyback and guided for a higher payout of 60-70% on a steady state. We forecast a payout of 65-75% in 2025-27 (vs 60% in 2024).- We expect positive revisions to Street DPS estimates for 2025/26/27 (JPMc Bt 0.13/0.16/0.17 for 2025/26/27). Importantly, this DPS level appears sustainable to us for at least the next five years, with the starting point of an 18.2% CET1 and \\(\\sim 150 - 200\\) bps CET1 accretion p.a. over the next 2-3 years providing this visibility.- TTB has the lowest NIM sensitivity to policy rate cuts within D-SIB banks, which should be relatively positive in a rate cut cycle. However, slower growth is likely to keep PPoP under pressure.- TTB is redoubling its efforts on consumer lending (payroll, credit cards, auto-cash and home equity), as well as fee businesses (car insurance, second-hand car platform, small-ticket MFs). These can help loans and fees, but come with risks of higher provisions and operating costs. The bank is mindful of AQ risks, so growth in the high-yield segment (15% of loan book) is managed at a slower clip, while the rest of the book is contracting (2024 loans down 6.6% y/y).- TTB has signed an MoU to potentially acquire TLeasing (a motorcycle finance company) and Thanachart Securities (a securities firm). These transactions appear logical to us in terms of size and product offerings. Pricing is not yet disclosed, but our calculations suggest that, at a 1x P/B, the combined transactions should be around Bt6.4bn (56bps of CET1). The combined entities represent \\(\\sim 90 / 280\\) bps of group assets/ equity and should add 1.5-2% to TTB's ann. EPS.- We adjust tax credit of Bt15.5bn as a non-core item and value it at Bt0.10/share.",
