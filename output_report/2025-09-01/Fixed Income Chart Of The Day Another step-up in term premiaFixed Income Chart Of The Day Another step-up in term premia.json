      "text": "From a tactical perspective, the coming two months tend to be favourable to higher term premia. From a strategic perspective, several key factors justify a further increase in term premia. Firstly, the shift in supply/demand summarised by our global free float continues to point to upside, which is further supported by the fiscal stance at the global level. Secondly, the risks to Fed independence support a higher risk premium. Thirdly, China seems to have opted for a (gradual) focus on domestic demand rather than further support to exports by implementing \"anti- involution\" measures and allowing its currency to appreciate. Fourthly, after all, the term premium is still at its pre- 2014 historical low, and the conditions that led to a low term premium environment in the 2014- 2020 period (relatively tight fiscal policy, positive supply shock to oil prices, central bank QE) are reversed (structurally easier fiscal policy, negative supply shocks, central bank QT, immigration controls and tariffs).",

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",
