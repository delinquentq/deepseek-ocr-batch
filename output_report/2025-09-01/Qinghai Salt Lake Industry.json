However, continued supply additions would lead to lower prices in the coming years, from potential new expansion from Laos and other regions. For lithium operation, we recognize the recent supply disruption from China supply should provide support of spot lithium carbonate price beyond its current domestic marginal cost support. However, lithium supply is more global in nature than others, and risk on the current spot price, \\(39\\%\\) above the bottom in June, is on the downside in our view, given the intrinsic excess capacity globally (link).
