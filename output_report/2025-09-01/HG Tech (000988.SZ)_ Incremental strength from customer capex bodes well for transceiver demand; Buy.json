Recent CSP capex strength and outlook (e.g. BABA, link) bring incremental strength to HG Tech's transceiver growth outlook, in our view, thus removing an overhang on demand sustainability (due to previous concerns over foreign AI chip constraint). With this, we are more positive on HG Tech's transceiver shipment momentum into 2H25\\~2027E with upward revision of \\(3\\% \\sim 8\\%\\) in our net profit estimates.

Our previous estimates factor in \\(18\\%\\) QoQ shipment growth for 400G transceiver in 3Q25E, and we are now more positive on the growth momentum considering customers' capex/demand strength, expecting \\(41\\%\\) QoQ growth to align with the company's capacity per month (800k units).",

We are constructive on HG Tech given its expansion into high- end optical transceivers (800G and 400G modules), which should drive margin improvement and accelerate net profit growth in 2026E- 27E. Current valuations are at the lower end of its historical trading range on 2025E P/E, which we view as attractive. Going forward, a key catalyst will be HG Tech's 800G and 400G ramp progress and profitability improvement. We are Buy rated on HG Tech.",
