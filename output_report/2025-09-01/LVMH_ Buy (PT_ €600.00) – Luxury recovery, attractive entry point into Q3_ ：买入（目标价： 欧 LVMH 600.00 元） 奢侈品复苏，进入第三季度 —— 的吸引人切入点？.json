So what has been the main driver of the DTC performance during the quarter is the lack or the decrease in tourism, mainly from Korean and Chinese. And to a lesser extent, Americans also a little bit less present in Europe. Regarding the performance in Asia, the performance of Korea was helped by return of some tourism from China. You know that it decreased a lot in the past year. So we have seen a small recovery of Chinese brand. So they were positive on the Korean market while they were negative in Japan, mainly due to currency evolution that was in a way, we've seen the yen going up, the renminbi going down.
