Although the upgrade to the haul road and commissioning of transhippers 5- 7 should be completed in FY26, we continue to see the main risks to achieving 35Mtpa as the ability to achieve targeted truck speeds and complete maintenance, and availability of the transhippers to account for cyclones and rough seas.
