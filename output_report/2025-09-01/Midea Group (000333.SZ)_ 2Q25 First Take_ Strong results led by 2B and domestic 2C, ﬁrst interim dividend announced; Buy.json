Meanwhile, the company announced its first interim dividend of Rmb0.5 per share (implying a \\(15\\%\\) dividend payout to interim EPS vs. Rmb3.5 dividend per share and \\(70\\%\\) dividend payout for full- year 2024). This echoes our positive view of Midea as our top pick within white goods due to its diversified revenue growth drivers (domestic/overseas appliances/HVAC and burgeoning 2B business), strong position in the industry value chain and thus leading profitability, as well as market- leading shareholder return.",

The overall GPM decline was partly due to faster growth of 2B with lower GPM.

The above said, total profits still grew at a faster rate vs revenue due to efficiency gains and contribution from other profit items.

In overseas appliances markets, we expect Midea to expand its market share on the back of its competitive products and increasing investment in branding, manufacturing capacities as well as retail infrastructure such as its sales network. Of the four emerging 2B business areas as long- term growth drivers, we are most constructive on the intelligent building solution given its huge revenue opportunity, market consolidation potential and Midea's advantage as a unique full- suite solutions provider leveraging its leading position in the commercial HVAC and bundled offering of elevator and building management system.
