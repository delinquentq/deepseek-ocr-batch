The rebound in M1 growth over the past 12 months largely reflects a one- off drop in corporate demand deposits in mid- 2024, driven by tighter regulations on banks' interest compensation practices. In addition, part of the rise in M1 growth comes from households shifting from time to demand deposits amid much lower deposit rates. Without significant improvements in corporates' desire to invest and households' willingness to consume, M1 growth may stop accelerating or even moderate after base effects fade and PPI deflation is likely to continue next year.",

Both money and credit indicators have showed a notable rebound recently. Total social financing (TSF) growth has recovered from a trough of \\(78\\%\\) yoy last October to \\(9.0\\%\\) yoy in July, largely due to strong government bond net issuance. M1 growth, commonly regarded as a proxy for corporate and household willingness to spend, also accelerated to \\(5.6\\%\\) yoy in July, up from \\(- 3.3\\%\\) yoy last September (Exhibit 1). Faster M1 growth points to easing PPI deflation ahead (Exhibit 2). While M1 remains a reliable 12- month lead indicator on major inflation measures, we expect only gradual acceleration in inflation, with PPI deflation likely to persist into 2026. PPI inflation may not turn positive until early 2027, in our view. The rationale for this divergence lies in the drivers of M1 growth.",

The level of these deposits declined sharply from Q1 to Q2 2024 (before recovering in Q4 after the government's September policy pivot), primarily as regulators tightened curbs on manual interest compensation (top- ups that effectively raised deposit rates; 手工补息) used by banks to compete for deposits.2 This regulatory effect was largely a one- off adjustment to deposit levels, but it introduced significant base effects into the year- over- year growth.3 With the base 12 months ago lower, year- over- year growth should be stronger even without sequential gains. We estimate about 60bp of the 1pp rise in M1 growth this July came from base effects. Exhibit 4 shows demand deposit levels as a percent deviation from trend- implied values.4 After a sharp drop in Q2 2024, corporate demand deposits have recovered modestly but remain \\(20\\%\\) below trend- implied levels.
