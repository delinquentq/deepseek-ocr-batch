Since we added the stock to our Buy list on 7/6/2022, COPL's share price has fallen \\(38\\%\\) , vs. coverage average \\(- 48\\%\\) and MSCI China \\(+15\\%\\) . While COPL has outperformed its industry peers due to its more stable business outlook and solid backing from its central SOE parent COLI, we attribute its underperformance relative to the broader market to the persistent property market headwinds, which continued to drag on the property management sector's business outlook and valuation, as well as COPL's own slowing topline and earnings growth, coupled with low visibility of enhanced shareholder returns. Following its 1H25 results, we see a broad- based revenue growth deceleration across VAS and PMS verticals, as the company faces headwinds from its ongoing VAS business reshuffling and an incrementally challenging external business expansion environment. While we acknowledge the company's efforts to explore a broad array of new growth areas, entering these nascent businesses risks downside to profitability since growth and profitability headroom is already tight in its core businesses. The challenging property/macro environment will also likely prolong the path to profitability for these new ventures. Additionally, the incubation phase will require substantial investments, posing a risk to free cash flow in the near term. We therefore see limited visibility for its earnings growth to re- accelerate (1H25 core profit was \\(+4\\%\\) ) you to Rmb769mn, below \\(10\\% /8\\%\\) you growth expected by our prior FY25E and consensus).",

This challenge could be exacerbated if the company shifts further towards 2G/urban services segments, which typically involve longer payment cycles. Additionally, shareholder returns appear to be a lower priority for management compared to other SOE peers, given no indication of any plan to raise the dividend payout ratio beyond the current level of c. \\(35\\%\\) , placing COPL at the lower end of its SOE peers range (i.e. \\(40\\% - 65\\%\\) ).
