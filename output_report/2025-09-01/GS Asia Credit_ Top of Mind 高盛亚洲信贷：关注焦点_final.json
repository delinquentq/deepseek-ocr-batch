In Asia, we had four issuers announcing mandates today – FUBON USD 10.25Y Tier 2 / PTTGC PerpNC5.25 & PerpNC10 / KYUSEL USD 10Y / BNKEA CNH 4NC3 Non- Pref. At opening, Taiwan lifers led the underperformance with SHIKON/NSINTW trading 1- 2 wider in street and SHIKON subsequently getting lifted by RM. On back of the new issues, PTTGC complex moved 10- 15bp tighter while TOPTB also moved in tandem, tightening 7- 10bp as of writing. In China space, BABA credit has underperformed equities where we saw limited buying in the credit curve (bonds unch on spread) despite the strong equity performance (+18%). As for Indonesia space, its underperformance post the protests started to fade into the session (earlier than expected..) where we have seen material RM demand for bonds and also selling of CDS from both macro accounts who bought on Friday and credit accounts as a position ahead of the roll. The demand for INDON cash bonds was mainly on the belly and we were 2- 3bp wider so far today (i.e., 2- 3bp tighter from the wides) while the 5y CDS topped out at 75 and got back in around 74 before lunch.",

Private consumption expenditure growth sharply increased to a one-year high of 7.0% YoY (+6.2% QoQ s.a.), partly reflecting a steady revival of mass consumption. Real GVA growth rose to a six-quarter high driven by the services sector – this came as a surprise given the potential impacts on tourism from airport closures due to the Pakistan/India border conflict in May.

Turnover of risk though is getting more difficult as the market doesn't want to overly buy credit at these levels but remain invested for the carry profile for the next 4 months.

Renewables closed 0.125-0.25pts higher (between -10bps/+10bps) with higher duration tickers outperforming e.g. SAELLT 31s +0.5pts, HBSPIN 31s +0.625pts, ARENRJ 39s +0.5pts and CGRNEG 33s +1pt. NBFCs were busy as MUTHIN priced a \\(600mm 4.5yr\\) note (4yr WAL) at \\(6.375\\%\\) yield - the new MUTHIN 30s closed the week \\~0.15pts higher while the rest of the curve was very active on two-way flows between RMs (29s -0.5pts or 30bps wider, 28s unch). Other NBFCs were roughly flat (sector 10-15bps wider) with the recently issued IHLIN 28s struggling to rally despite an up-print at \\(100 on Monday (closed at\\) 99.50, +0.4pts from reoffer). SHFLIN 28s were the outperformer closing 0.3pts higher on RM demand while MGLIN 28s closed 0.3pts lower (25bps wider). Elsewhere, BIOLIN underperformed to close 0.375pts lower (30bps wider) on small-sized RM selling while VEDLN was marginally higher by 0.125-0.25pts (29s outperforming at +0.375pts). UPLLIN 30s saw some RM interest to close 0.2pts higher (12bps wider).",
