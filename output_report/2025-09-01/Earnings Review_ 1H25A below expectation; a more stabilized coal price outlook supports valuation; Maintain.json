Excluding one- off items including FX gain and impairment loss, recurring net profit was Rmb26.68bn, \\(15\\%\\) lower yoy. The result was below our estimates mainly due to lower profit from the coal segment, but mostly in line with Bloomberg consensus.

The outlook on coal price has incrementally improved, in the context of the ongoing supply work supporting more stabilized domestic coal prices in 2026E- 2027E, versus the declining trend at prior course. As a result, we expect unit EBIT profit of coal for Shenhua to average Rmb186/t and Rmb183/t and net profit to stabilize at Rmb50.8bn and Rmb51.6bn in 2025E and 2026E, after the \\(19\\%\\) decline yoy in 2025E. We expect solid cash flow generation, continued strengthening in the balance sheet to support Shenhua's dividend payout at \\(70\\%\\) , implying \\(4.9\\% - 5.6\\%\\) yield for A/H share. For the recent proposed asset injection from the parent, our previous illustrative analysis suggests a mostly muted impact on the listco's EPS, subject to the acquisition price (see here). Maintain Neutral/Neutral with a revised 12m price target of HK\\$32.0 (from HK\\$29.0) for Shenhua- H (implying PE of 11.7x on 2025E) and Rmb34.0 (from Rmb31.0) for Shenhua- A, (implying PE of 13.3x on 2025E).",

The outlook on coal price has incrementally improved, in the context of the ongoing supply work supporting more stabilized domestic coal prices in 2026E- 2027E, versus the prior declining trend. As a result, we expect unit EBIT profit of coal for Shenhua to average Rmb186/t and Rmb183/t and net profit to stabilize at Rmb50.8bn and Rmb51.6bn in 2025E and 2026E, after the \\(19\\%\\) decline yoy in 2025E.
