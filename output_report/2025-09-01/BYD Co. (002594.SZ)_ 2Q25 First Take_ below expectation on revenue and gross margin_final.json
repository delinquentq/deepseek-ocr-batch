We believe the company is well- positioned both in the domestic and overseas markets, capturing the largest mass- market demand and building up premium brands with supportive NEV policies in the domestic market. At the same time, BYD is starting to tap into the overseas market with compelling (highly competitive, innovative) products, which we expect could become a second growth driver for the company, contributing \\(23\\%\\) of incremental vehicle sales volume in 2024- 2030E. With a comprehensive product portfolio and strong in- house capabilities enabling continued vehicle technology innovation, we expect BYD to grow its total vehicle sales volume from 4.3mn in 2024 to 8.9mn in 2030E, capturing 1/3 of China's NEV wholesale demand. BYD A/H shares are trading below their historical average 12m forward P/Es, which we view as attractive. We are Buy rated. Catalysts include strong sales, new supportive policies for the NEV industry, breakthrough in overseas markets, and quarterly results.
