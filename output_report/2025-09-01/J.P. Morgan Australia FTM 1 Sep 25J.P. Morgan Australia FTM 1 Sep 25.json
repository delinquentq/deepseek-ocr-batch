The past season echoed Prospero's words: a rally built less on earnings substance than on sentiment, flows, and a sense of optimism. Healthcare and Tech faltered, REITs and Discretionary led the charge, and the market overall gained. Earnings downgrades persisted through the month, with only \\(17\\%\\) of companies seeing upgrades post results.- Gale force volatility – Over \\(30\\%\\) of the ASX 50 moved by more than \\(+/- 3z\\) on result day. A number of 'blue chips' suffered record or near-record on-day declines – CSL, JHX and WOW in particular. Dramatic moves to the upside were also a regular feature of the season, with BXB, COL and QAN all gaining \\(9\\% +\\) on-day. As we anticipated in our result season preview (link), Aug-25 set another record for volatility (see Figure 3), with nearly a third of the index moving by more than \\(3z\\) .- Earnings caught in the downdraft – EPS forecasts were cut across all but one sector (REITs) on a rolling post-result basis. With share prices on the rise, this translated to a \\(0.54x\\) P/E multiple expansion through August. The chart to the right highlights the largest P/E moves through the month. While we aren't singularly bearish – noting our REIT, Discretionary, Materials OWs – there is clear valuation stretch apparent in several segments of the market. Banks carry much of the downside embedded in our weighted index target; our team's average price target implies \\(15\\%\\) downside across the majors.- A foul wind blows from the west – A troubling feature of this season was the trials and tribulations encountered by a range of companies with offshore operations. The malaise particularly afflicted those with US exposures, including AMC, CSL, JHX, REH and RWC. Even those doing well in the US market, notably BXB, pointed to soft and challenging macro conditions.- Beats and misses: an even balance – Our team's forecast for the beat/miss ratio (note) was again close to the mark. Their prediction was for an elevated proportion of in-line results, which proved to be the case. Misses outnumbered the beats and downside reaction to falling short (-6.2%, rel) was more than double the upside reaction to beats (+2.9% rel).",

After backing out the A\\$6.3m uplift from the accounting treatment of the MMF3 facility, the \\(+13\\%\\) earnings beat was driven by a strong Australasian print, more than offsetting earnings declines in US Shipbuilding. Beyond the growing order book, we expect near- term earnings to remain supported by the recognition of MMF3 proceeds. While tailwinds are clearly evident, we retain our Neutral rating on valuation grounds but also note elevated operational risk as ASB undertakes multiple new shipbuilding programs. PT A\\$7.10.",
