We estimate the projectors/optical engines business were under continuous pressure as overall consumer demand for projectors remained weak in 1H25 despite limited trade- in stimulus support. FORMOVIE, Apptronics's JV with Xiaomi primarily involved in consumer projector business, reported \\(16\\%\\) revenue decline and - 46mn losses (vs 49mn profits in 1H24). Different from 2024, the company didn't provide revenue of auto related 2B business. However, we note that sales volume for AITO M9, a major revenue contributor for Apptronics auto business, declined by dd% yoy since April 2025. Meanwhile, the company is facing more competition from Xgimi which is also ramping up its auto 2B business. The only bright spot was the cinema business which grew by \\(7.5\\%\\) yoy in 1H25 per disclosure. We note that the company is trying to expand into new business lines such as smart glasses and smart auto lighting. However, given it takes time to commercialize such technology, we expect limited revenue contribution in the near term and foresee uncertainty in mid/long term.",
