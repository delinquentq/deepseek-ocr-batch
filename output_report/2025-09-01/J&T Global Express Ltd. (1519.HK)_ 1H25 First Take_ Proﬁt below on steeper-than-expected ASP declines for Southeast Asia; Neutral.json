By segment, (1) China adj. EBITDA came in at US\\)155mn (largely in- line with GSe of US\\)160mn, while below VA consensus of US\\)199mn), driven by 12% yoy decline in ASP while partially offset by improvement in cost efficiency; China parcel volume grew at 20% yoy in 1H25 (vs. industry of 19%); (2) softer- than- expected revenue and EBITDA in Southeast Asia market as the company passed on its efficiency gains to end- customers, stimulated parcel volume growth that accelerated to +58% (vs. 41% in FY24); (3) new markets and cross- border segment revenue came in in- line with GSe, with adj. EBITDA at breakeven for the first time driven by economies of scale and operating efficiency improvement. From J&T's results call, we highlight: (1) Sequential domestic ASP improvement in Guangdong and Zhejiang driven by Anti- involution policy, with higher parcel mix from individual & reverse parcels (7%, from 5% last year); (2) Leveraging its know- how from China for Southeast Asia to sustain its market leading position in SEA and aims to further reduce cost through improvement in utilization efficiency, self- owned fleet, and automated equipment; (3) Strong growth potential in new markets driven by the fast development of LatAm eCommerce market, with collaboration with Mercado Libre starting in 2025.",
