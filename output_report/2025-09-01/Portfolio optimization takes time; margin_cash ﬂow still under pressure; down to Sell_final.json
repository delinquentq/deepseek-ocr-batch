Moreover, third- party AR impairments increased as a result of management's more prudent revenue booking/impairment provisions for services provided to residential property owners as well as rising repair and maintenance costs on the expiration of warranties on projects delivered in recent years. Looking forward, given SUS' portfolio has sizable low- quality projects delivered by affiliated developer Sunac China (1918. HK) in recent years, we expect another 1- 1.5 years for margins to stabilize and impairment risk to moderate. Coupled with its more conservative dividend policy guidance (mgmt. revised dividend payout base from core profit to net profit, i.e. including impairment, etc. for the latter), we now expect relatively unattractive shareholder return for SUS at only \\(1\\%\\) dividend yield in 25E, vs. coverage peers of \\(4\\%\\) and POE PM peers' MSD% to HSD% level.",
