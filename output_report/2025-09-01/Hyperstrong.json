As the leading BESS supplier in China and a pure play in A- share, Hyperstrong is boosted by the surge of China BESS installation. We expect the China BESS upcycle in 2024- 2027E to drive a \\(\\sim 37\\%\\) EPS CAGR for Hyperstrong on the back of a \\(50\\%\\) volume CAGR and margin expansion. In 2024- 2030E, we forecast \\(21\\%\\) EPS growth on the back of \\(34\\%\\) volume growth. Considering the competitive landscape, we assume Hyperstrong's market share to decline from \\(\\sim 12\\%\\) in 2024 to \\(6\\%\\) in 2030E. In the long term, we assume mid- cycle GPM of \\(15\\%\\) (NPM of \\(7\\%\\) referring to 2025 trough levels), from 2024 GPM of \\(18\\%\\) (NPM of \\(8\\%\\) ). Our target price implies 2025E- 2027E P/Es of \\(23\\times 13\\times 10\\times\\) . We are Neutral rated on the stock as we believe the market has priced in Hyperstrong's near term growth potential.",

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
