We lower our FY3/26- FY3/28 operating profit estimates by \\(2\\% /2\\% /3\\%\\) to factor in a slower pace of mobile subscriber acquisition amid intensifying competition, provisions related to the handset purchase support program (a one- off cost), and sluggish demand in the business segment, particularly for digital BPO services. We slightly raise our 12- month target price to ¥2,590, from ¥2,540, to reflect the increase in the sector average EV/EBITDA multiple (from 6.8X to 7.0X for FY3/27E). We forecast FY3/26 operating profits of ¥1,150 bn (+3% yoy), which is below guidance (¥1,178 bn) as we think weaker mobile subscriptions and DX demand will make attainment difficult. We also think the company will struggle to achieve its EPS target (¥194.4 in FY3/26) unless it books one- off gains (e.g., reversal of provisions related to Myanmar) or implements additional share buybacks. While the impact of new rate plans and price hikes for existing plans should become apparent from 2Q (July- September) onward, we think these moves will create a headwind for mobile subscriber acquisition momentum in the near term by pushing up the churn rate. We maintain our Neutral rating, as we believe the slowdown in mobile net subscriber additions and struggles in the business segment will weigh on the share price, despite continued stable operating profit growth.",
