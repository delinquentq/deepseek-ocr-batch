We remain positive on Cambricon and raise our 12m TP by 14.7% to Rmb2,104 (implied 45x 2030E P/E) with 2030E EBITDA increased by 8% and 2030E target EV / EBITDA multiple increased by 6%. Our earnings raise is mainly on (1) higher AI chips shipment, reflecting rising China Cloud Capex in AI infrastructure investments, supportive government policies, and emergence of local chipsets in rising inferencing trend, and (2) enhancing opex ratio on rising revenues scale and improving operation efficiency. The company's revenues per engineer in the past 12 months increased to Rmb5m by June 2025 vs. Rmb2m by Dec 2024. Maintain Buy.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
