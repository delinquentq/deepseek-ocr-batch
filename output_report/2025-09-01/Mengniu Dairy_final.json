      "text": "We hosted Mengniu NDR in Singapore on Sep 1st. Key takeaways include: 1) Management guided MSD-HSD % top line decline in FY25, but expected overall liquid milk to decline slightly with narrowing trend in 2H25 vs. 1H25 (-11%). The company remains cautious on the gifting demand trend for mid autumn festival in 3Q and also for 4Q due to a later Chinese new year on calendar shift; 2) 2B business as a key highlight: Mengniu expected its 2B overall sales to reach c.Rmb10bn in 2025E (DD% topline contribution) with DD% yoy growth rate, (e.g. Milkground achieved DD% growth in 1H25 for 2B cheese business). More specifically for the Rmb10bn sales target, the company expected: 60% from liquid milk, mainly selling coffee/tea chained stores, food service etc, and 40% from solid milk, mainly driven by sales from Australian plants and Milkground cheese. Despite that GPM for 2B business will be lower than 2C, while OPM overall stayed at a healthy level (esp. for the 2B liquid milk business which can get to c. 5% NPM, tracking the group level at c.5% in 1H). 3) Long term margin opportunity from other business segments: the mgmt. expected cheese to reach over Rmb5bn sales with Rmb2.3bn in 1H and ice cream at c.Rmb6bn sales with Rmb3.9bn in 1H (South-east Asia EBITDA margin doubled last year with sales up by DD% and NPM near to the group-level) in FY25. The mgmt. also mentioned infant formula to resume positive growth. Therefore, they expect to see continued margin expansion in the longer term from non-liquid milk business, while for liquid milk, the mgmt. set the goal to stabilize the current margin level going forward. 4) Raw milks S/D cycle: winter time this year will be the key to watch for S/D dynamics while mgmt still observing prolonged downcycle (in 2025 YTD, seeing a HSD % yoy decline in demand for liquid milk vs. supply side cut by LSD % into 3 with large-scale dairy farms are reluctant to cut herd size and top 10 consolidating upstream market). That said, the mgmt. still",
