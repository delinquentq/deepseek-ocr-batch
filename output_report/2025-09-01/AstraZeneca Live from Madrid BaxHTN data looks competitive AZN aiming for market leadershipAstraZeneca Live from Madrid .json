Overall we continue to like AZN and see the BaxHTN data strongly de- risk baxdrostat, demonstrating an efficacy/safety profile competitive vs. MLYS' lorundrostat, with a potential edge on sustained 24- hour BP control and no drug- drug interaction with proton pump inhibitors (see details below). AZN plans to file back in the US by 2025 with potential launch in 2026; the P3 BaxPA monotherapy trial will be initiated in primary aldosteronism, with P3 combo data (with dapagliflozin) expected in 2026+. P3 Bax24 trial with an extended half life (with potential to deliver 24- hour SBP control) is expected to read out in 2H25. We see high potential for back as both mono and combo therapies given the significant unmet need for hard- to- control hypertension; AZN guided for \\(>5bn\\) peak sales (we currently model \\(\\sim \\S 2.6bn\\) , risk- adj).",

This lack of a significant rebound effect suggests that baxdrostat is not just an \"on/off\" treatment. Instead, he theorized that the drug might be \"resetting\" underlying physiological mechanisms, such as how the body handles sodium.
