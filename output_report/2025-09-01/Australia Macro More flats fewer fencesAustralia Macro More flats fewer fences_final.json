The real value of residential work done crept higher in the quarter, and is now at its highest level since June 2019.

If that pace of completion were sustained every quarter for five years, it would deliver just under 1.1mn dwellings. Still not quite there, but a lot closer to target than the 45,000 dwellings completed in Q1- 25, a run- rate of only 900,000 over five years.",

One notable parallel with Australia is lacklustre productivity. Germany's may even be worse - productivity in residential construction has been in structural decline since reunification. But Jochen is upbeat about the future. Indeed, he expects a boom in German dwelling construction underpinned by aggressive industry consolidation and massive technological renewal via digitalization, robotics and industrial construction that looks set to deliver huge productivity gains through prefabricated construction. But he also concludes that fewer detached houses would be built in Germany in the future, and that a recent trend towards larger buildings with smaller apartments is likely to persist.",

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",
