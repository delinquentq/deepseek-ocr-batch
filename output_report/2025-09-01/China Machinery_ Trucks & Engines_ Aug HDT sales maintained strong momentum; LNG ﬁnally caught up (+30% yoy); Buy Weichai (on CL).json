The long- term overhang from truck electrification has dominated our discussions with investors on the stock valuation, but we believe that Weichai's stronger cycle- over- cycle earnings prospects (very rare within our China machinery coverage) has been underappreciated by the market. This differentiates our view, as our long- term earnings projection has modeled in higher peak engine sales volume and a unit net profit \\(>2x\\) vs. its long- term average. Moreover, we also expect a robust FCF profile ( \\(\\sim 10 - 20\\%\\) yield over 2025E- 27E), which along with a strong net cash position (c.1/4 of Weichai's market cap) should lead to increasing payouts (+5ppt p.a. towards \\(70\\%\\) GSe), further enhancing shareholder return.

Our 2025E- 27E EPS estimates are firmly below the Visible Alpha consensus likely because we are factoring in a faster truck electrification trend as well as structural margin deterioration vs. the Street, in addition to the slowdown in export market (after rapid growth between 2021 and 2024) driving an unfavorable shift in geographic mix (exports are much more profitable compared to domestic business). With the stock trading close to its historical mid- cycle average P/E level (11x) and close to 1SD above its 5- year average level (8.5x) despite structural margin pressure and muted earnings growth ahead, we view valuation as expensive and see better opportunities to ride the potential cyclical inflection of the domestic HDT industry elsewhere in our coverage.

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
