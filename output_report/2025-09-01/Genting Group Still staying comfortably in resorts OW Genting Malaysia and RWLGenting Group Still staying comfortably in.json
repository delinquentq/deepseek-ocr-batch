While the pace of recovery is slightly below our expectations, partly due to the recent strength of the Malaysian ringgit \\((+6\\%)\\) against USD in 1H25), we are confident that the recovery will continue into 2H25. Overall, we remain comfortable with Genting Bhd's credit profile, which will anchor the ratings for its two strategic subsidiaries, Genting Malaysia and Resorts World Las Vegas. However, we are neutral on Genting '27s due to valuations and see better value in Genting Malaysia and Resorts World Las Vegas, which we see as a spread pick- up play over Genting Bhd given their close relationships.",

Despite a more challenging industry backdrop for the Las Vegas gaming sector, we believe RWLV should continue to see a sequential recovery in the coming quarters as it slowly wins back high- rollers with the Nevada Gaming Control Board's complaint now behind it. Admittedly, RWLV remains weak on a standalone basis, e.g., it would need to generate US\\\\$160 million EBITDA just to cover its interest expense. However, we believe that the Genting group will be supportive, given RWLV is a strategic subsidiary, considering the group's ambition to increase its footprint in the US gaming sector. RWNY is bidding for a full casino license in New York). We believe this is underscored by the equity injections from the Genting group over the past two years,",

Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).",
