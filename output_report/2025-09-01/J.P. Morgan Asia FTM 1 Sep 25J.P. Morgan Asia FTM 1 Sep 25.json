We believe TCOM's solid 2Q25 result and healthy financial outlook for 3Q25 should dismiss investor concerns and drive share price upside. As a market leader in OTA with a strong foot print in mid to high- end consumers, TCOM looks well positioned to capture the following near- term and long- term trends: spillover effect from an A- share rally, outbound travel, international OTA expansion and inbound travel. Maintain OW with a new PT of US\\(90/HK\\)700 as we rollover our valuation base to 2026 with the same 20x target multiple.",

Tactically, if there is significant policy easing in the housing market, we believe Longfor may offer \\(>70\\%\\) upside if we simply benchmark to the peak in October 2024. However, even if we assume 'no big policy', we believe Longfor may still retrate gradually to \\(\\sim \\mathsf{HK}\\$ 14\\) (33% potential upside) in the medium term, if we apply a 10x P/E to recurring (non- DP) net income (assuming zero value from DP). From a trading perspective, we also observe Longfor seems to have found a solid support level at \\(\\sim \\mathsf{HK}\\$ 9\\) .",

Longer term, our view on BYD remains unchanged, especially regarding its overseas expansion where capacity- build (i.e. Indonesia, Brazil, and Hungary) is one to two quarters ahead of plan.

TTI's acquisition of a \\(5.03\\%\\) stake in Japan's Ryobi (5851 JP; source: Bloomberg) reinforces its global brand ecosystems and aids the expansion into the Japanese market challenging the incumbent Makita. Additionally, positive read- throughs from Home Depot and Lowe's recently announced 2Q25 results, along with optimism for US interest rate cuts, tax reform and accelerating industrialization, bolster TTI's growth prospects amid the expanding global power tool TAM. With these developments, we are raising our PT to HK\\$135, reflecting our confidence in TTI's ability to achieve robust earnings growth in the forecast period. Maintain OW.",

Tactically, if there is significant policy easing in the housing market, we believe Longfor may offer \\(>70\\%\\) upside if we simply benchmark to the peak in October 2024. However, even if we assume 'no big policy', we believe Longfor may still retare gradually to \\(\\sim \\mathrm{HK}\\) 14 (33% potential upside) in the medium term, if we apply a \\(10x\\mathrm{P / E}\\) to recurring (non- DP) net income (assuming zero value from DP). From a trading perspective, we also observe Longfor seems to have found a solid support level at \\(>HK\\) 9.",

We estimate Longfor still has capacity to raise another Rmb10- 15bn, which can cover the outstanding balance of offshore bonds (Rmb9.5bn). Meanwhile, the Rmb8.0- 8.5bn FY25E net profit from recurring income (likely Rmb10bn in a few years' time) helps offset the earnings dilution from DP. Over the next few years, we expect Longfor to transform from a DP- focused developer into a recurring income- focused asset manager (Figure 6).",

From an earnings perspective, we think the worst is not over. We forecast FY25E core net profit to drop \\(80\\%\\) Y/Y to Rmb1.4bn (implying almost no profit in 2H25E) (Figure 1), as the low- margin DP projects \\((0 - 1\\%\\) gross margin) will still drag down overall earnings (we forecast recurring net profit to be Rmb8.0- 8.5bn in FY25E, implying a net loss of Rmb6.6- 7.1bn from DP).
