But even as US equities reached new heights, there were still plenty of doubts swirling in the background that took some of the shine off that. First, were the ongoing questions about the Fed's independence, which led investors to price in faster inflation and drove a fresh round of yield curve steepening. Second, French bonds remained under pressure given the fiscal trajectory there, with the Franco- German 10yr spread up to a 7- month high of 82bps. And after the US close, Nvidia's share price fell in after- hours trading, as its results added to the sense that the explosive growth seen during the AI boom of 2023- 24 was decelerating. So US equity futures have also fallen a bit this morning, with those on the S&P 500 down - 0.12%.",

This still represented a sales increase of over 50% compared with a year earlier, but is a clear deceleration from the growth numbers of recent years, when year- on- year sales growth had peaked above 200%. Additionally, revenue at the chipmaker's main data- centre division was actually a touch below estimates (\\$41.1bn vs \\$41.3 est), whilst sales to China remain a major source of uncertainty. The chipmaker said it didn't record any sales of its H20 chips to China in Q2 but claimed it could ship \\$2bn to \\$5bn of the chips this quarter if it can overcome geopolitical issues. Bear in mind that earlier this month, the US announced that it would resume export licenses for H20 chips to China, which were paused earlier in the year, in return for 15% of the revenue. However, the company said this plan had not yet been codified.",

Indeed, the 2yr inflation swap (+2.7bps) moved up to its highest level since late- 2022, at 3.08%. So this isn't just an abstract issue, and there was a fresh steepening in the yield curve too as a result. So the 2yr yield (- 3.6bps) fell to its lowest since April, at 3.61%, whilst the 10yr yield fell - 2.7bps to 4.23%, and the 30yr yield inched +0.2bps higher at 4.92%.

For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
