While 2Q25 was more impacted than our expectations by the reversal of pre- buying that took place in Europe 1Q25 (owing to which we reduce FY25E adj. EBITDA by \\(0.3\\%\\) ), we continue to expect an acceleration in European construction driven by the German stimulus measures and market expectations of lower interest rates in 2026 and see Geberit as a key beneficiary given its exposure to the region. Our 3Q25 preliminary barometer (Exhibit 3) also already points to some sequential recovery near term, whereas the ECB mortgage lending survey (Exhibit 5) points to sizeable expansion over the medium term, which we think could lead Geberit back towards its \\(4\\% - 6\\%\\) medium- term organic sales growth target.",

      "text": "Geberit has offered shower toilets in its home markets since the 1980s, with early- generation wash- function toilet systems introduced in Switzerland and the DACH region. In 2009, Geberit relaunched and consolidated its shower toilet offering under the AquaClean brand for broader European consumer adoption. It has since broadened its portfolio to target distinct price tiers and use cases (Exhibit 14), supported by heightened marketing in core European markets (Switzerland, Germany, Austria) and selective expansion elsewhere in Europe. In its 2023 CMD, Geberit highlighted shower toilets as a core value- driven growth initiative with the company positioning itself as the European market leader owning the entire value chain. The shower toilet range spans from premium to basic, with Geberit's most recent model, Alba, introduced in 2024, offering a more accessible entry level price for a wider market.",

This drives a gross margin of c.45%- 85% (across the lower to higher price range), up to 40pp higher than that of a traditional toilet. For the purposes of our analysis, we calculate group gross margin as revenue from sales less operating costs which equates to c.50% in 2024 (where we include half of the personnel costs given the FTE breakdown between manufacturing and white collar roles, most of the depreciation expenses, a fifth of intangibles amortization, freight costs and half of energy expenses).

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
