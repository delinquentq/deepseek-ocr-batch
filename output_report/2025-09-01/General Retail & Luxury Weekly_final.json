We have been taking a more constructive stance on Luxury post the 1H results and investors have been wanting to see some evidence of a better luxury consumer. China was always set to improve largely based on easier comparatives from last year in 3Q but it still helps to have companies confirming this. And in our view, the US tariff impact on luxury was always likely to be less impactful than what other sectors experience, but the \\(39\\%\\) Swiss tariff still had the risk of some \"sticker shock\" on pricing. We would like to see some additional commentary on price elasticity to back up the Swatch comments, but the positive trading comments are supportive - and reflect what we believe investors wanted to hear to justify delving back in to the Luxury sector.",

The main areas of pushback were on the higher savings rate, which may provide a cushion (potentially amongst the higher income consumers but fear of unemployment generally drives the higher savings) and whether the \"budget fear\" may be similar to 2024 where there was no immediate impact on spending with a stronger- than- expected 4Q performance (the main difference this year is rising inflation and falling employment levels). The messaging from companies is almost uniformly cautious on UK spending, which may reflect a degree of understandable caution. It does appear that leisure spending is being prioritised to a greater degree – with music concerts and summer holiday spending seeing no signs of a slowdown. This may see slightly more subdued retail spending as consumers start to look towards Christmas.",

With regards to current trading, they pointed out that in July US sales were up \\(19\\%\\) and expect August to be up \\(c.20\\%\\) with Mexico and Canada strong as well. Although not quantified, management suggested that China was doing better but from a low level and Hong Kong is improving as well. We believe investors have been wanting to become more bullish on the Luxury sector as we look at a sequential improvement in 2H on 1H, and the positive data points likely reinforce this view more than a negative data point will dent the view. The sector sentiment is shifting, which suggests that earnings downgrades are no longer expected, and just hitting numbers for 3Q is likely to be enough at this stage to maintain the momentum.",

There are proposals in the EU to introduce a \"handling charge\" per parcel and the UK is reviewing the customs treatment. In the US the removal of the de- minimis exemption for packages under \\(800 has created a number of problems in the implementation but is likely to slow the growth from the Chinese discount retailers. Whilst an incremental £1.5bn of sales is small compared to the overall £220bn UK non- food retail sales, it does account for all of the £1.5bn sales growth in the market. The categories for this £1.5bn increase are not disclosed, but we suspect there will be a larger impact in clothing and smaller household items. In our coverage there has been a clear impact on the lower- price- point retailers such as Primark and B&M but likely there has been a degree of impact across the board.",

We do find the timing slightly perplexing in that Artemis has an influential seat on the board and a new CEO has been appointed but is yet to announce the full strategy (to be announced with the 3Q in October). Trying to sell a large investment before the new strategy has been announced feels slightly unusual in terms of timing. From an investor point of view, there could be some upside from a potential trade buyer if an offer were to be incoming; there has been an uptick in brand acquisitions at depressed valuations in the last year. We think the Puma brand could benefit from a reset and realigning its distribution with the customer perception of the brand.",

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Unlike an actual performance record based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.",

Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within the Deutsche Bank Group. Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in research reports published by Deutsche Bank AG. Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of Deutsche Bank AG. It should be noted that the decision to incorporate ESG factors into any investment strategy may inhibit the ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with your investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.",
