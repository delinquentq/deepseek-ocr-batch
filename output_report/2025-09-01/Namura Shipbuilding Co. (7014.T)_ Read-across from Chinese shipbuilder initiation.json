While our analyst expects orders to decline \\(- 44\\%\\) yoy in 2025, due to uncertainty about tariff policy and its impact, he forecasts annualized growth of \\(+6\\%\\) from 2026 to 2032. He thinks the overall increase in demand between 2025 and 2032 will reflect (1) greater replacement demand for ships built in 2009- 2012 \\((48\\%)\\) , (2) increased demand for new ships capable of using alternative fuels, amid tighter emissions regulations \\((26\\%)\\) , and (3) growth in global trade volumes \\((26\\%)\\) . He thinks replacement demand will be particularly strong for tankers and bulkers, as a relatively high proportion of these vessels were built around 2010. We view this as potentially positive for Namura Shipbuilding, which focuses on building these types of ships.",

Its main business is the building of new commercial vessels, and it also carries out repairs and maintenance work for the Japanese Self- Defense Forces, the US Navy, and commercial shipping companies. We expect the market share of non- Chinese shipbuilders in the global shipbuilding industry to increase amid growing geopolitical risks. We look for an improvement in the supply/demand balance in Japan's shipbuilding industry, reflecting the prolonged slump that the industry has experienced, as well as structural factors such as a declining working population. We expect Namura Shipbuilding to generate steady operating profit growth from FY3/27 on the back of a gradual increase in shipbuilding capacity accompanying productivity improvements at existing shipyards, as well as an improvement in order value per new vessel. We believe current PBR valuation is not sufficiently incorporating such expectation. Potential share price catalysts include a FY3/26 guidance beat and growth in the value of new orders received.",
