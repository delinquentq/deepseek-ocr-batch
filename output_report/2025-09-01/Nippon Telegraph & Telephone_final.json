While legacy business (fixed- line voice revenue, etc.) is set to continue a structural decline, we expect this to be offset by growth in enterprise business (SI, etc.) and optical business (FTTH, etc.) (Exhibit 4). While it will not affect FY3/26 earnings, the company is focusing on reviewing its call centers and internal systems, and on utilizing generative AI, and expects to achieve cost savings of c.¥30 bn in FY3/28, the final year of its medium- term plan. We have not factored this into our forecasts given the lack of clarity on progress, but we will be watching for developments as they could present upside risk to our FY3/28 forecasts. The impact from the drop- out of asset sales gains (which had a roughly - ¥80 bn impact on FY3/25 profits) will not affect FY3/26 segment earnings.",

We expect these structural trends to persist in the near term. Meanwhile, demand for overseas IT services remains sluggish due to worsening macro sentiment, particularly in Europe and APAC, where business tends to be more cyclical (consulting, equipment sales, etc.). Considering earnings trends at major overseas vendors, we expect demand for NTT Data's overseas IT services to remain lackluster in 2Q, with a recovery likely from 2H.

NTT has positioned synergies from group realignment as a medium- term growth driver, with major changes including NTT DoCoMo making NTT Communications and NTT Comware into wholly- owned subsidiaries, and the integration of NTT Data and NTT Ltd. Operating profits turned downward yoy in FY3/25 due to a decrease in gains on the sale of assets and lower demand at NTT East/West. We expect earnings to remain sluggish in FY3/26 due to fewer gains on asset sales and weakness in telecoms/overseas IT services. However, we expect operating profits to return to growth in real terms in FY3/27 (excluding gains on data center transfers) as the impact of fewer gains on asset sales runs its course, the boost from price hikes contributes for the full year, the pace of increase in sales promotion costs peaks out, and demand for overseas IT services recovers. We expect profit growth to outperform the sector average from FY3/27. NTT is proactive on shareholder returns, and we assume the announcement of regular share buybacks (around ¥200 bn a year). We regard the stock as undervalued in view of these factors.",
