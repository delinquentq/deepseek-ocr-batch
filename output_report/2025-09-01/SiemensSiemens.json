We seek to address point 3 as best we can in the absence of precedent, noting that nobody (including the company) can be certain how this would be structured, yet.",

It would however be quite uncharacteristic of Siemens, and all the other large cap EU industrials we follow, to be quite so shareholder friendly. If this happens, the longstanding debate about SIE's relative capital deployment track- record should be turned upside down and re- rate multiples. Clearly, Siemens doesn't need to retain a stake per se, nor does it require any cash proceeds from such a transaction, which we explored extensively in last week's note. The only downside we see would be temporary and stem from the fact that the SHL free- float would instantly be c4x current levels, which is good for structural multiples but would likely lead to significant volatility initially.",

There is no precedent for this, but we assume this is more a function of its inefficient tax consequences, as this would result in a c7bn tax bill (paid by Siemens to the German tax authorities, some of which could be recouped by investors depending on jurisdiction) resulting in a lesser c 20 distribution, as opposed to there being a regulatory barrier that we know of. There are also multi- year liability considerations associated with a retained stake, which would make it less attractive still. In our view, there are smarter ways to structure a process like this, but the 25bn provision in our PT is materially in excess of a potential 7bn tax bill and the overhang of having a retained stake. This scenario would, however, lead to less SHL volatility due to a smaller proportion of transient SHL holders versus a full spin.",

In theory a similar approach could be used for SHL, prior to a tax free spin of the balance.

Because this would be an optional exchange, the distribution of the SHL shares would not be proportional to the current holdings, unlike a spin. As well as being tax free, this approach would mean that new SHL holders would be deliberate owners as opposed to potentially transient investors, reducing SHL volatility. There would be a cost / value transfer of course, as the parent would typically incentivise shareholders to opt for an exchange, which on the basis of what we have seen in the US examples would be a c7-10% discount (i.e. €3bn at current levels) versus a VWAP period.",

Regardless of the structure, we cannot foresee a scenario in which the tax cost, leakage or value transfer would come close to the €25bn provision already embedded in our assessment of fair value. Put another way, the valuation unlock from a SHL separation will ultimately offer differing levels of upside and SHL volatility depending on how tax efficient management want to make this process. In absolute terms, the figures involved are large, but disproportionally small versus the value unlock potential and when put in the context of the current market value. Given that the company has been carrying out a detailed assessment of this complex topic for the better part of a year, they will be very well informed on all of the above, and more, and will make an informed decision based on the long term interests of all stakeholders, in our view.",

Whilst painfully slow at times, it has unequivocally resulted in a better business with higher growth prospects, higher gross and operating margins and more predictable FCF. The shareholding in SHL (73% or €40bn) is the next and perhaps final step in this journey, which we expect to be addressed at the CMD.- Strong core. Siemens' exposure to automation, software, electrification and mobility is attractive in the current context and should deliver above sector average organic growth on a multi-year view.- Focus moves to execution. After years of structural change and higher investments, Siemens is entering a period where the focus moves to execution, driving growth and improving margins, returns and cash.- Valuation support.
