All major leading edge semi manufacturers have begun to use its ALD tools for 5nm/3nm/2nm processes. It dominates the logic market in ALD. Its position in the memory market is improving. In particular, as DRAM uses logic like high- k metal gates and then moves to 4F2 architecture, it will use more single wafer ALD tools, benefiting ASMI. ASMI has also increased its share in Epitaxy over the last four years, expanding its share well beyond its historical customer/s.",

However, current macro uncertainties suggest ASMI should trade at a discount to the midpoint of this valuation range. We estimates that ASM's stock should trade at \\(\\sim 27.5x\\) on '27e EPS, which would be equivalent to €624. We discount this for one year (given our PT horizon of end- date of Dec '26) using a \\(9\\%\\) discount rate which would give the company a share price target of €573. Apart from this, the company owns \\(25\\%\\) of ASM Pacific with a current market value of €14 per share. Putting it all together results in our Dec- 26 price target for the stock of €587.",
