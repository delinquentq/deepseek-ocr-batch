Over weekend you had the China August PMI, up m/m at 49.4 (see below and here), Weather continued to play a negative factor, equally Anti- Involution helped ease deflationary pressure.... From our side Trina will be in China in two weeks, sense is Anto - Involution is a burgeoning theme, in my mind its more a 4th plenum medium long term narrative (plenum end of Cotober), than a 2024 Sept style stimulus tool. Last week part of the ask was Steel Prod. So far minimal cuts (if any), still see a 50mt type end 2025 target as the headline mkt looking for. Is there room to expand this to 100mt if they target unreported capacity? 100mt seems like a lot, with steel margins positive most don't think the 50mt is realisable, let alone a doubling of that.
