FLY is an emerging provider with a differentiated product in a supply constrained launch industry. It also has unique product offerings in its spacecraft business. We see significant growth as the company increases its launch cadence and delivers on large contracts in its backlog. If successful ramping up, there should be significant operating leverage. However, today, Firefly does not generate positive earnings or FCF, and the timing of reaching scale is a question in what is not necessarily a recurring model. The Alpha rocket had an anomaly on its last launch, and just received FAA approval for its next launch. While we see an attractive medium to long- term investment case, we think it is prudent to wait to see how the next launch plays out, given the inherent risks. We initiate with a Neutral rating.",

It has taken significant share from ULA, which was historically the launch provider of choice for NASA and DoD, and is now mostly competing with Rocket Lab, which has much lower capacity in its small launch vehicle, Electron. ULA lost share to SpaceX over time, as SpaceX's rideshare offering and reusability on Falcon 9 brought economies of scale and lower cost to orbit to satellite operators.

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
