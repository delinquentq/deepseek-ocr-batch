      "text": "This report summarises key macroeconomic metrics and frameworks that we are closely monitoring. We provide a regular update on the evolution of developed market (DM) rates markets in the recent past. Considering the uncertainty surrounding trade and fiscal policy, we begin by comparing budget balances and current account balances across major DM countries. We then analyse the distribution of outstanding bonds by investor type to assess the proportion held by price- insensitive investors, such as domestic central banks. Moving to market pricing, we examine pricing trends of major central banks, followed by recent market movements in key rates products. Finally, we update our cross- country PCA of term premia, as well as the seasonality of selected rates instruments. Definitions, methodologies, links to our key views, and recent publications are provided in the appendix.",

This increase in term premia is also evident at the long end of the curve, as 2s30s slopes in most countries extended their steepening momentum through summer. As we head into autumn, seasonals until the end of October remain more favourable for higher term premia.",

Given rising concerns over debt sustainability in major G10 and European countries, we recently tested multiple macro variables' explanatory and predictive power. This analysis showed debt/GDP has weaker predictive power on future government bond performance, while residuals of mapping between yields and external position measures (e.g., current account, NIIP) exhibit better mean- reverting properties. For more details, please see our latest assessment across EGBs and G10.",

In addition to the conventional twin deficit calculation, which is simply the sum of the projected Budget & Current Account deficit of each country data from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) database, we have also created a \"twin deficits score\". For each year, the twin deficits score is a weighted average of the previous years' twin deficits. We assign a higher weight to this year's Twin Deficit (t), followed by gradually lowering the weights of the past five years (t- 1, t- 2, ..., t- 5) twin deficits and finally adding some weight to the cumulative twin deficit up to year t- 5. This allows us to create a synthetic twin deficit score which combines both the most recent flows and the historical stock of budget & current account deficits. Considering the fundamental difference between Norway and other G10 countries, we make adjustments to Norway's twin surpluses and NIIP when mapping with its market pricing.",

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Unlike an actual performance record based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.",
