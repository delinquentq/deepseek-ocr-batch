Both charging products and innovative products recorded close to \\(40\\%\\) yoy growth in 1H25, while wireless products came slower at \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) yoy. By region, domestic sales moderated qoq to a total of \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) yoy growth in 1H25, while overseas maintained \\(30\\% +\\) growth. Channel wise, offline grew faster and accelerated to \\(+44\\%\\) yoy growth in 1H25 driven by region expansion and efficiency gains.

We came away with the impression that: 1) Management struck a positive tone on expansion into emerging markets (vs previously most of the company sales were from developed markets such as US, Europe and Japan) as they noticed consumer demand for quality consumer electronic products also presents significant opportunity in these regions. Management mentioned the number of countries/regions they covered has increased from \\(\\sim 150\\) to \\(\\sim 180\\) . 2) Product wise, management highlighted energy storage and cleaning appliances products led growth, while core traditional charging business, security and earphone products also showed robust growth. Meanwhile, they continued to explore new products including UV printing and lawn mower. 3) On margins, management expects incrementally greater tariff impact in 2H as low- cost inventory exhausted, yet they have been leveraging overseas capacity to mitigate the impacts and might consider pricing adjustments depending on market conditions. Comparatively, management see the negative impact from recall of power banks has been mostly reflected in 2Q25.",
