      "text": "China Merchants Port (0144. HK, CMH) released 1H25 results on Aug 29 and hosted an analyst briefing after market close. The company reported net profit of HK\\\\$3.6bn (- 19% YoY) slightly below our expectations. The profit miss was largely driven by 1) lower investment income of Rmb2.0bn (- 26% YoY) from Shanghai Int'l Port Group (SIPG, 600018. SS, Sell), due to profit miss from the property development segment and SIPG's dilution loss on Postal Savings Bank (HK\\\\$444mn loss attributable to CMH); and 2) Other income fell to HK\\\\$115mn (vs. HK\\\\$867mn in 1H24) due to one- off fair value gains and net reversal of credit losses booked in 1H24. After excluding SIPG's profit contribution and other income, CMH's core profit would have increased by +13% YoY to HK\\\\$1.7bn (vs. HK\\\\$1.5bn in 1H24). Key takeaways include: 1) For FY25, CMH maintains full year throughput guidance of +1- 2% for domestic terminals, and 5% for overseas terminals, though 1H25 already recorded 4% YoY growth for domestic and this implies a \\(\\sim 1\\%\\) YoY decline in 2H25. 2) CMH has achieved contract price hike of 2- 3% in domestic terminals and 3- 4% for overseas terminals in 1H25, which would maintain for the rest of the year. 3) For M&A capex, the company has signed an agreement to acquire 70% of shares in Vast in Brazil in Feb- 25 which if completed, CMH notes would add US\\\\$448mn (equivalent to HK\\\\$3,494mn) of M&A Capex in 2H25.",
