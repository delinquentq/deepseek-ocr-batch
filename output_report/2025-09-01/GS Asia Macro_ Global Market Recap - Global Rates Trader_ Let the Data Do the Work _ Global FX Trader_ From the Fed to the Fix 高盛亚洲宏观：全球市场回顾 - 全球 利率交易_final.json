This has resulted in a steeper curve than the fundamental picture would typically justify and has sustained the outperformance of belly breakevens. While risks surrounding the future composition of the Fed will likely persist, the busy upcoming data calendar should see the market return its focus to 2025 pricing where the market remains on the hawkish side of our economists' Fed baseline. As a result we continue to favor short expiry receivers on the front-end as a means to navigate event risk, and hold SFR25 longs cross market versus ERZ5. OAT- Bund spreads have widened in advance of a confidence vote scheduled for 8 September. We think the market is already pricing in enough premium for deficit deterioration, and that spreads will ultimately tighten unless the risks of fresh elections rise. We also see limited room for spillovers to other sovereign spread markets, or to Bunds – although we do think the risk-reward in Bund swap spread tightening is currently poor. Upcoming inflation data will be key for UK rates, we recommend 2s5s Gilt steepeners given our baseline for deeper cuts, but also for a scenario of data resilience resulting in a combination of shallow cuts and higher terminal rates.",

In our view, it was notable these came without much FX market pressure—DXY has been flat for two months and both CNY and CNH were trading weak to the fix when policymakers moved it stronger still, which is an unusual combination. There are good cyclical and structural reasons for the RMB to strengthen, and it's a key ingredient to the broad Dollar as we look for new leadership in the depreciation trend. We think the forces that weighed on the Dollar in H1 are still active, and we increasingly see the required ingredients—like the CNY fix signals—for a more sustained depreciation. We see the softening labor market as confirmation of the main thrust behind our view that the Dollar should fall further; the US is not outperforming the way it has for much of the last decade, and that warrants a weaker currency. We think it would take an outsized surprise in the unemployment rate to provide a meaningful dovish impulse on USD. But over the medium term, FX investors should not conflate the “curious kind of balance” created by the simultaneous slowing in labor supply and demand with something that is necessarily good for the Dollar. We don't think the French fiscal risks now coming into focus a little earlier present much of a hurdle to this view, or will prevent the kind of rebalancing that often benefits the Scandis. But it is one marginal reason",

If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the offered Product, the price quoted by Goldman Sachs would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, and the quoted price (and the value of the Product that Goldman Sachs will use for account statements or otherwise) could be higher or lower than the original price, and may be higher or lower than the value of the Product as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs. If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase the Product or otherwise values the Product, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, if you sell the Product, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. Goldman Sachs may conduct market making activities in the Product. To the extent Goldman Sachs makes a market, any price quoted for the OTC derivative transactions, Goldman Sachs may differ significantly from (i) their value determined by reference to Goldman Sachs pricing models and (ii) any price quoted by a third party. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.",

If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the offered Product, the price quoted by Goldman Sachs would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, and the quoted price (and the value of the Product that Goldman Sachs will use for account statements or otherwise) could be higher or lower than the original price, and may be higher or lower than the value of the Product as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs. If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase the Product or otherwise values the Product, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, if you sell the Product, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. Goldman Sachs may conduct market making activities in the Product. To the extent Goldman Sachs makes a market, any price quoted for the OTC derivative transactions, Goldman Sachs may differ significantly from (i) their value determined by reference to Goldman Sachs pricing models and (ii) any price quoted by a third party. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.",
