      "text": "Feihe reported 1H25 earnings on Aug 28; sales/NP decreased by \\(9.4\\% /47\\%\\) , mainly on channel destocking since 2Q25, higher marketing expenses related to the new birth subsidy, and losses associated with the raw milk downcycle (incl. a large- biological impairment/dry powder re- sales loss at c.Rmb400mn/c.Rmb300mn in 1H25). The company further guided down its full- year sales to Rmb21bn (incl. VAT tax) or c. Rmb19bn (post VAT, decline yoy by DD%) with continued destocking into 3Q and a delay in its super premium+ product launches. The company targets FY25 net profit to stay at around Rmb2bn as biological/milk powder impairment loss is likely to impact its earnings in 2H together with more intense market competition without meaningful signs of an improvement in raw milk S/D dynamics. While we recognize the company's efforts in product mix enhancement (we see an increasing portion of its new super- premium Astrobaby SKU \"Zhuorui\" in the total revenue mix) as well as more resilient online growth (our tracker shows \\(27\\%\\) yoy growth in 1H25), and steady IMF GPM (Zhuorui GPM up to \\(78\\%\\) in 1H25), we expect further destocking into end - 2025 and expect it to spend more marketing dollars going forward to regain market share amid rising competition from domestic brands (both Yili/Junlebao announced that the new birth subsidy has been executed since Apr/May 2025. Yili's IMF sales were up \\(14.3\\%\\) in 1H25, per mgmt.) Therefore, we downgrade Feihe to Neutral from Buy as competition dynamics remain our main concern of its topline/bottom line performance into 2H, considering the stock is trading at \\(13.4x / 41.5x\\) 2025/26 P/E (vs. its average trading P/E at 12x in 2020- 2025) on recurring EPS with c. \\(5\\%\\) yield in 2025 on \\(100\\%\\) dividend payout, or c. \\(8\\%\\) yield combined with Rmb1bn share repurchase. Also, we expect recurring earnings to go up \\(16.3\\%\\) yoy in 2026, but reported earnings to increase \\(40.3\\%\\) in 2026 from a low base with the help of less one- off negative impacts",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
