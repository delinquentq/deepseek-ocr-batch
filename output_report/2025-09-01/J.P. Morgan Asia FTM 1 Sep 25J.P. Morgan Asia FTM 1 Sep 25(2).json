We believe TCOM's solid 2Q25 result and healthy financial outlook for 3Q25 should dismiss investor concerns and drive share price upside. As a market leader in OTA with a strong foot print in mid to high- end consumers, TCOM looks well positioned to capture the following near- term and long- term trends: spillover effect from an A- share rally, outbound travel, international OTA expansion and inbound travel. Maintain OW with a new PT of US \\(90 / HK\\) 700 as we rollover our valuation base to 2026 with the same 20x target multiple.",

Tactically, if there is significant policy easing in the housing market, we believe Longfor may offer \\(>70\\%\\) upside if we simply benchmark to the peak in October 2024. However, even if we assume 'no big policy', we believe Longfor may still retrate gradually to \\(\\sim \\mathsf{HK}\\) 14 (33% potential upside) in the medium term, if we apply a 10x P/E to recurring (non- DP) net income (assuming zero value from DP). From a trading perspective, we also observe Longfor seems to have found a solid support level at \\(\\sim \\mathsf{HK}\\) 9.",

Management believes profitability should start to rebound in 3Q25. Longer term, our view on BYD remains unchanged, especially regarding its overseas expansion where capacity- build (i.e. Indonesia, Brazil, and Hungary) is one to two quarters ahead of plan. We thus forecast the overseas business to contribute to around half of BYD's total profit, up from \\(\\sim 40\\%\\) this year.

TTI's acquisition of a 5.03% stake in Japan's Ryobi (5851 JP; source: Bloomberg) reinforces its global brand ecosystems and aids the expansion into the Japanese market challenging the incumbent Makita. Additionally, positive read- throughs from Home Depot and Lowe's recently announced 2Q25 results, along with optimism for US interest rate cuts, tax reform and accelerating industrialization, bolster TTI's growth prospects amid the expanding global power tool TAM. With these developments, we are raising our PT to HK \\(135, reflecting our confidence in TTI's ability to achieve robust earnings growth in the forecast period. Maintain OW.",
