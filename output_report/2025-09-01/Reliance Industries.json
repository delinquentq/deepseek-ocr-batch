On hydrogen, RIL guided for the electrolyser giga-factory to be also operational by end-CY26, with the ability to scale up to 3GW capacity. We assess polysilicon and batteries as two key bottlenecks in India's new energy ecosystem - in that context we note RIL has started construction of a polysilicon plant (potentially first factory in India) and recently highlighted they will be installing 175-megawatt hour batteries each day at full operational scale. Management reiterated the target for the New Energy business to achieve similar scale as the O2C (oil to chemical) business within the next 5-7 years",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
