Apr- Jun earnings were weak due to US tariff impact. However, based on companies' views of the tariff impacts and their countermeasures, we expect both company and market forecasts to be raised. If tariff impact becomes manageable, the likelihood of a BOJ rate hike would increase. May- July data showed corporate reform progress in FY2024, but this was not priced in owing to high uncertainty over tariffs. With the final tariff agreement, we think corporate reform is starting to be priced into stocks. Inflows continued in August, driven by futures buying. Cash equity",

Subsequently, after the release of the US jobs report August 1, expectations for a preemptive rate cut increased, supporting stock prices. Limited expectations for yen appreciation, even if the Fed cuts rates, and the improvement in Japan's GDP, QMI, and economic surprise index supported Japanese stocks (Figure 28).

Once the reduced auto tariff takes effect, we think the impact on operating profit of Japanese companies in FY2025 could be limited to about 2\\%. In fact, the forecasts of 42 major companies (Nikkei 225 companies that disclosed the amount of tariff impact) show a total impact of about \\(4 trillion on FY2025 operating profit (source: Nikkei survey, Japanese only), more limited than our estimate.

Japanese stocks subsequently rebounded on rising expectations for Fed rate cuts and the US- Japan agreement, erasing most of their decline owing to the reciprocal tariff announcement. The rebound in stocks during this period was led by overseas demand theme groups, such as heavy industry in the machinery sector and semiconductor- related stocks in the electrical machinery/precision sector, as well as information & communication/services (including games), construction/materials, trading companies, banks, and insurance. Among major theme groups, US policy beneficiary stocks, stocks with a high likelihood of trimming strategic shareholdings, high- quality/value stocks, DX- related stocks, and reshoring stocks did well.",

Among domestic demand- driven sectors, we maintain our overweight stance on IT services, information & communication, real estate, and defense, where domestic demand is likely to be stable; food and transportation, where margin and ROE improvement and increases in shareholder returns are likely; and retail, which should benefit from a recovery in consumer spending and ongoing inbound tourism. Within the financial sector, we maintain our overweight stance on banks. For the time being, we maintain a neutral stance on the insurance sector, where rising long- term interest rates are likely to be a focus and a deterioration in securities valuation gains/losses is a concern.",

Our sector stance is thus bullish. For the electronics/precision sector (Junya Ayada), we see ongoing structural demand tailwinds for industrial electronics as demand related to modernization and DX remains strong, mainly in Japan, and power demand from data centers associated with upgrades of power facilities and the proliferation of AI continues to boost demand for power transmission/distribution/installation. For semiconductors (Mio Shikanai), the situation remains difficult to be optimistic about, especially for the front- end processes, given the uncertainty over semiconductor tariffs and a slowdown in legacy demand in China. For electronic components (Akinori Kanemoto), a recovery in orders and sales of components for autos and industrial machinery, where inventories continue to be reduced, is gradually becoming clear, but momentum for automotive components remains weak, so our sector stance remains neutral. For pharmaceuticals (Seiji Wakao), we think sector stocks will start to recover as cautious views on US policy risk ease as the Apr- Jun results were good.",

For toiletries, we expect progress on adding high value and raising prices in Japan. For food (Satoshi Fujiwara), the negative aspects of a demand decline owing to prolonged food inflation are notable, but we also like companies that can be expected to increase ROE by boosting shareholder returns using financial leverage. For IT services (Matthew Henderson), overseas market conditions continue to be challenging owing to corporate investment cutbacks and project delays, but we think the momentum of IT investment by domestic companies is strong. For games (Junko Yamamura), the focus is on multi- platformization, the game industry as an IP business, and sales growth in emerging countries.

With the reduction of Japanese and US automobile tariffs to 15%, the impact of tariffs, particularly on major companies, should be manageable. However, a range of environmental regulations such as GHG, CAFE, and ACC-II have been eased, and we think the cost of regulatory compliance in the US is likely to be significantly reduced from FY2026. We think the upside from deregulation could outweigh the downside of tariffs for assemblers, particularly for Toyota. With a high likelihood of a recovery in HEV and ICE demand, we also expect a scenario for growth in market share of Japanese assemblers. We also expect further growth in automatic and continuously variable transmissions, which are a cash cow for Aisin (Akira Kishimoto)Consumer/ Industrial Electronics/ PrecisionIn industrial electronics, structural demand tailwinds continue. For IT investments, modernization and DX demand remain strong, particularly in Japan. Additionally, major IT service companies are transitioning from custom-based Sler-type business models to standardized offering models, which address management issues unique to each client, and we expect this transition to keep contributing to margin improvements. For infrastructure investment, power equipment installation needs are being boosted by the replacement of power facilities and strong data center electricity demand, supported by the penetration of AI. Although capex lacks strength, it is in a gradual recovery phase. Based on these considerations, we focus on NEC (6701, OW) and Fujitsu (6702, OW) in the industrial electronics sector. In contrast, there are concerns about a demand slowdown for consumer electronics and precision instruments due to inflation. With limited room for hardware innovation, consumer budgets are likely to continue shifting towards services and entertainment content. We are focusing on Sony Group (6758, OW) in the consumer electronics sector. (Junya Ayada)Semiconductor/ Technical materials/Cement(1) Semiconductors: Due to the uncertainty surrounding semiconductor tariff trends and the slowdown in legacy demand from China, the situation remains challenging, particularly for the front-end. We continue to watch Adanest (6857, OW), where we have high expectations for EPS growth. (2) Glass: European architectural glass is showing signs of market improvement due to supply restrictions. Additionally, semiconductor-related glass remains steady. We expect Nippon Electric Glass (5214, OW) to have various opportunities in semiconductor support glass. (3) Cement: While domestic cement price revisions are progressing steadily, demand remains challenging. (Mio Shikani)Electronic ComponentsWe maintain our neutral sector stance. Orders and sales are gradually starting to show signs of recovery in automotive and industrial machinery applications, which are currently in a phase of inventory adjustment, but momentum remains weak in the automotive field. In the short term, we focus on Nidec, where the stock price is lagging. Against this backdrop, we will watch the trend in MLCC utilization rates into 2H 2025. Capacity utilization rates at MLCC manufacturers have risen to close to 90%, but we will watch trends in the latter half of 2025 to determine whether there will be a gradual recovery, largely determined by movements in final demand, and whether that recovery ends up being short-lived, as in the 2024 cycle, or whether there is a full-scale recovery that leads to tighter supply/demand conditions heading into 2026. (Akinori Kanemoto)ChemicalsIn the petrochemical and commodity materials areas, there were companies experiencing steady performance despite the global supply-demand imbalance. This was due to the positive effects of transforming their business portfolios and the strong performance of specialty products. In the petrochemical sector, many companies anticipate an improvement in the operating rates of naphtha crackers from July to September onwards. However, this outlook may seem optimistic due to the decrease in regular maintenance. We look for earnings improvement driven by strong demand for advanced semiconductor materials, the reduction of unprofitable businesses, and the effects of M&A. (Yasuhiro Nakada)SteelWe have a mixed impression of steel fundamentals. At 1Q earnings, Nippon Steel and JFE cut full-year guidance on an adjusted basis excluding revisions of FX assumptions and tariff impact. In particular, this was due to deterioration in export profitability from foreign trade measures and continued weakness in steel prices. Domestic demand also remained weak from both the construction and manufacturing sectors. However, since July, there has been a rebound and stabilization in the Asian market due to expectations for China&#x27;s anti-involvement policies (aimed at reducing excess competition), production cuts due to environmental regulations, and price increases by major steel companies. We expect production cuts in China to continue, reflecting the anti-involvement campaign, and if price increases by steel companies in take hold, market conditions could improve towards autumn even if only gradually. We focus on JFE (5411, OW), which has high exposure to the Asian market. (Tatsuya Maruyama)PharmaceuticalsWith cautious views on US policy risk easing and favorable earnings confirmed in April-June results, we believe the pharmaceutical sector is entering a phase of stock price recovery. September is the academic conference season, and we expect updates from companies to further improve sector sentiment. Until now, the shares of mid-sized companies with limited impact from US policy have performed well, but from here on, we expect large companies to take the lead. We recommend Otsuka Holdings, which has strong current performance and where we feel negatives have been exhausted, and Chugai Pharmaceutical, which saw a significant drop in stock price following the off-rigorization results that fell short of expectations. (Seiji Wakao)MedTech &amp;amp; ServiceIn the medical equipment sector, the share prices of Asahi Intec, Terumo, Nipro, and disposable product manufacturers rose after April-June results announcements, and we think these gains exhausted share-price advances for the near term. Share prices of Sysmex, Olympus, and other capital product manufacturers, meanwhile, declined after results. We think the valuations of these companies are near a bottom amid impact from deterioration in Chinese market conditions, though the timing of a recovery is unclear. While Shimadzu trades at a low valuation and is affected by the worsening Chinese market, we expect its shares to rise moderately on the prospect of recovery from Jul-Sep because it caters to a wide range of industries. In the healthcare services sector, we anticipate continued recovery from weakness in FY2024 by M3 and JMDC. (Naoko Saito)",

      "text": "SectorCommentRetailingOperating profit growth is in line with or above guidance at more than 80% of our coverage companies, and earnings are generally favorable. We see few factors that could unexpectedly drive up costs amid strong demand and successful price pass-through. However, share prices at most companies are favorable and within or above a fair-value range, making it more challenging to choose where to shift. Among lagging large-cap stocks, we focus on Fast Retailing, which we rate Overweight (Dairo Murata)TransportationIn an overall strong market supported by receding tariff concerns, expectations of lower US interest rates, and solid stock supply and demand, railway and logistics sector stocks outperformed TOPIX, particularly in summer. Railway shares seem to have been slow to reflect their value, real estate shares were reassessed, and logistics shares were also slow to reflect their value, while improving volumes and rising unit prices also contributed. We still see risk of share price corrections when tariffs are finalized, but would still be bullish on domestic logistics operations for their improving fundamentals and relatively limited tariff impact. The external environment will be a major factor, but if Bank of Japan interest rate hikes establish a trend for rising rates and a strengthening yen, we would expect transportation to be preferred over railways. Also, if higher interest rates put value stocks in focus, shipping sector plays could also become a preference. (Ryota Himeno)Cosmetics &amp;amp; Personal careWhile there are signs of a bottoming out in the cosmetics market in China, uncertainty about the future is increasing in Japan due to factors such as a slowdown in inbound demand. In the personal care sector, there is progress in adding value and raising prices domestically in Japan. Although the personal care goods market in Asia is highly volatile, companies are accelerating their responses. We focus on Lion, which in addition to the benefits of domestic price increases in personal care goods, has begun to see its high-value-added strategy take effect. (Akiko Kuwahara)Paper &amp;amp; PackagingDomestically, Oji Holdings has announced price increases for container board and corrugated products, as well as printing and information paper. Price pass-through momentum is growing. Overseas, the market recovery for both pulp and corrugated products is delayed. We focus on Oji Holdings due to its efforts in improving profit margins and advancing balance sheet reforms. (Akiko Kuwahara)Internet, Media, GameOur core recommendations in the game industry are Nintendo, Bandai Namco HD, and Konami. In the internet and services sector, we recommend OLC. In the games industry, we are focusing on 1) multiplatformization, 2) the game industry as an IP business, and 3) the expansion of sales in emerging markets. In the latest earnings, mobile games further emerged as a new platform for IP business, along with improved profitability through off-app purchases. We believe this trend will continue to accelerate. (Junko Yamamura)IT servicesApril-June results for domestic system integrators (Siers) show continued strong IT demand, with particularly strong IT investment momentum in the financial sector. Domestically, we see no short-term risk factors, but the overseas market continues to face a challenging environment due to companies limiting investment and delaying projects. The Japanese IT services sector is the only one maintaining high valuations. Meanwhile, in the telecommunications sector, among NTT, KDDI, and SoftBank, only SoftBank reported favorable results, and we expect this situation to continue for some time. (Matthew Henderson)FoodDeclining demand due to prolonged food inflation has become notable. We think the companies that can overcome this and achieve high growth are limited to Ajinomoto (with non-food businesses such as ABF and CDMO as drivers) and Kewpie (with overseas business as a driver). However, we would also watch companies that we expect to increase ROE by utilizing financial leverage and enhancing shareholder returns. Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings and Asahi Group Holdings fall into this category. (Satoshi Fujiwara)BanksIn 1Q FY2025, the YoY change in net profit was around 0% for the megabanks and about +10% or higher for Japan Post Bank and regional banks. Domestic net interest income (NII) continued to grow, so we view the current business environment as particularly positive for banks which depend more on domestic interest rate business. Against this backdrop, assuming a BoJ rate hike is around the corner, we particularly recommend Japan Post Bank, where ROE improvement was slower than peers until FY2024. (Takahiro Yano)Insurance, Diversified FinancialsWe believe that there were no major changes in the fundamental outlook following 1Q earnings, as uncertainties such as tariff impact have not significantly materialized. In the short term (the next three months), P&amp;amp;C insurers and ORIX (8591, N) may attract attention, as we see a possibility they will raise full-year guidance at 2Q results. Additionally, we expect Dai-ichi Life Holdings (8750), which had a low progress rate in 1Q, to catch up from 2Q onwards due to higher-than-expected gains from stock sales, supported by Japan&#x27;s robust stock market.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
