However, we lower our FY3/26- 28 duty- free sales estimates by around \\(10\\%\\) due to a narrowing price gap with overseas for luxury goods, and with this we lower our operating profit estimates by \\(6\\% /9\\% /9\\%\\) . On the other hand, we maintain our view that Isetan Mitsukoshi can control SG&A expenses, as it continues to reform its operating expense structure at a pace exceeding guidance. Reflecting our estimate revisions, we lower our 12- month target price to \\(\\yen 2,900\\) from \\(\\yen 3,400\\) (implies FY3/27E P/B of 1.9X and P/E of 18X).
