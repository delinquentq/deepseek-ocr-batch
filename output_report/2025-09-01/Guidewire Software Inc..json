In total, we think these factors are likely to drive sustained upward revisions to consensus estimates and compounding FCF, which justify our premium multiple for GWRE.",

These two elements in combination with one another are likely drivers of accelerated TAM penetration (cloud referencability, easier cross- sell), TAM expansion (e.g. Tier 3 insurers through InsuranceNow), and improving unit economics. Guidewire's industry- leadership has unlocked a more rapid pace of innovation, which has the potential to incrementally improve win rates, particularly in underpenetrated international markets. We generally believe that the essential nature of cloud core upgrades has insulated the end- market from the material growth deceleration post- 2021 that we observed across other software categories, complemented by sustainable growth in underlying industry",
