Under the weight of earlier rate hikes and normalizing saving/credit behaviour, consumption has slowed consistently over the last two years. Growth has been well below potential, though pick-up is underway, evident in business surveys and spending measures.- Capacity use and hiring intentions have normalized. Business survey measures of labour availability have returned to pre-2020 levels, taking pressure off wages, though unemployment looks to be stabilizing now. This could start to lift immigration flows.- The agricultural sector is looking more balanced. Prices for agricultural products have picked up strongly, removing some financial stability concerns in the farm sector and boosting business sentiment.- Fiscal policy has been neutral, with a rotation toward lower taxes, alongside retrenchment in government departments and agencies. Minimal fiscal impulse is allowing monetary policy to respond to growth on first principles.- Financial conditions remain tight, but improving. Mortgage rates continue to fall reflecting lagged cuts, supporting disposable income, though the RBNZ's DTI restrictions are limiting housing externalities from rate cuts. We expect a sub-3% cash rate by early 2026.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this security because of either legal, regulatory or policy reasons or because of lack of a sufficient fundamental basis. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. Recommendations will be at the issuer level, and an issuer recommendation applies to all of the index- eligible bonds at the same level for the issuer. When we change the issuer- level rating, we are changing the rating for all of the issues covered, unless otherwise specified.
