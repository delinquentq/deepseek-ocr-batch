We view both transactions as positive for the companies. For Multiplan, it would increase its stake in one of the top malls in our LatAm coverage, increasing overall exposure to AAA malls with limited impacted on leverage. For Iguatemi, it can help deliver the company following the Patios transaction. We retain our Buy rating on both companies.",
