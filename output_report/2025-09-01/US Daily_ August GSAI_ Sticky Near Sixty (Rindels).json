These weights parallel the Institute for Supply Management's pre- 2008 practice, substituting our materials prices index for their supplier deliveries index. The GSAI includes services as well as manufacturing Industries. As with the ISM indexes, a reading above 50 is intended to signal growth while an index level below 50 signals contraction. However, our analysis suggests that a GSAI of 50 appears more consistent with trend growth than with no growth. Survey responses were collected from August 20 - August 29.",
