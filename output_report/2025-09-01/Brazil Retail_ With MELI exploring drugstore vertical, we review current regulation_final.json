      "text": "In light of the Aug 29 news of MELI's potential acquisition of a drugstore in Sao Paulo (link), we review the framework regulating the sale of medical drugs in Brazil. At first sight, we understand that even though the current regulatory framework (link) allows for orders to be placed remotely (i.e. online), these orders must be fulfilled by a licensed brick- and- mortar drugstore where the inventory is held. As a result, the scaling of a 1P online operation would require a relatively extensive network of brick- and- mortar locations to provide the operation with sufficiently broad reach and reasonable unit economics. While we appreciate that MELI's potential acquisition of this unit may serve as an initial pilot test to explore a vertical in which it currently under- indexes, we note the company has historically favored a relatively capital- light and platform- centred approach.",

The regulation states that orders for medical drugs that are not subject to special controls can be placed remotely, via means such as phone or online; the regulation does not provide an extensive list of means by which an order can be placed, but also does not explicitly prohibit clients ordering through platforms that will execute the sale and delivery on the client's behalf.- However, we note that such sales, where the client places the order on the aggregator's website, which then intermediates the purchase, collection and delivery of the drug on behalf of the client, do involve an actual physical drugstore at which the order is purchased and fulfilled.- Based on the current regulation, our understanding is that MELI could look to",

The news comes at a time when MELI has looked to push deeper into new verticals, including those that drive greater purchase frequency with existing users and/or drive new users to the platform. Moreover, delivery platforms such as ifood (owned by Prosus, not covered), Didi and Meituan (covered by Ronald Keung) are increasing their level of investment in Brazil, with a focus to go beyond meal delivery into the quick commerce space.
