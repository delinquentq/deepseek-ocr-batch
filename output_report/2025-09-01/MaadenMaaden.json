      "text": "After a solid Q2'25 print, we expect Q3 & Q4 to be another strong quarter for Ma'aden, as peak DAP prices ( \\(\\sim 60\\%\\) of group EBITDA) will continue flowing with a lag into the P&L, while aluminium and gold prices (remaining \\(\\sim 40\\%\\) of group EBITDA) are forecast to hover at roughly around Q2 levels (link). On spot commodity prices, we calculate there is \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) upside to consensus 2025E EBITDA for Ma'aden. As we mark- to- market for higher realized commodity prices, our midterm EBITDA forecasts increase by on average \\(+3\\%\\) (we currently sit on avg \\(+5\\%\\) vs 2025- 27E BBG consensus) and thus our Dec'26 PT increases by a similar \\(+4\\%\\) to SAR 55/sh (vs SAR 53/sh prev.). While the outlook into year- end looks positive, we expect earnings momentum to decelerate materially next year, as a more robust outlook for aluminium and gold will only partially offset the negative impact from normalizing DAP prices, while the majority of Ma'aden's production growth remains back- loaded (towards end- 2027/28). Shares trade on spot 2025/26E EV/EBITDA of \\(14.9x / 12.6x\\) (vs LT avg of \\(\\sim 15x\\) ), P/E of 26x/22x & \\(1\\% /3\\%\\) FCF yields and we remain Neutral.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
