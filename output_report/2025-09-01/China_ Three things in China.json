The patterns are very similar to the previous month: price sub- indices continued to improve, presumably related to the \"anti- involution\" efforts to reduce excessive price- cutting in various industries. Adverse weather conditions continued to weigh on construction activity. According to the NBS, the capital market services PMI was above 70 in both July and August thanks to the recent equity rally.",

As discussed in the latest FX trader, the recent pattern of the PBOC's daily fixing is highly unusual. Historically, PBOC fixed USDCNY at lower levels than spot when the Dollar was strong and CNY was under depreciation pressures. However, the recent fixing lower has been in an environment absent of CNY depreciation pressures. In our view, this is a clear signal of the PBOC proactively managing CNY stronger against the Dollar. We continue to expect USDCNY reaching 7.0 by year- end and below 7 next year.",
