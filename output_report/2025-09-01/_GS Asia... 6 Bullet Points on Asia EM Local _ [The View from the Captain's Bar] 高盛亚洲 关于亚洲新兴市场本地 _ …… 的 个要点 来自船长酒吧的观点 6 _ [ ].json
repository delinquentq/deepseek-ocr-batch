On the equity side, the weekly note from Sean Navin (here) provides a great overview – with the conclusion being that we are still early in the innings for potential equity market return. On the FX side, Sun Lu’s note here from Thursday provides some context to the lower USDCNY fix that has dragged a bit more interest back into the short USDCNH trade. Indeed – this was followed up by GIR in the weekend’s FX Trader piece with it being described as a policy push’ rather than a ‘market pull’. 6mo CNH Forward points have risen \\(\\sim 100\\) pips over the past 2 weeks, reducing the negative carry burden of a short USDCNH position – largely due to the lower US STIR environment. In local rates – the ‘wedge’ between the market’s pricing of 7d interbank rates and the PBOC 7d OMO rate that existed for a large portion of the past 2yrs (until end Q225) is no longer a market dynamic with this metric and the metric between where deposit taking institutions (DR) and the broader market (FR) narrowing. As per the chart on the left below, the system currently operates in the most significant liquidity surplus of the past 5yrs – equity and rates tell the same story. This piece from Andrew Tilton / Hui Shan goes over the changes in China’s liquidity conditions and is worth the read – in essence, China has eased considerably and the recent pivot towards being less dovish probably is justified given the liquidity injection and the compression of both credit (LGBs vs CGBs and FR vs OMO) spreads in the past 6-12mo.

Despite inflation being low, and real rates being high; rates negative impulses from recent growth data and expectations of a potentially larger fiscal burden from tariff protection continues to weigh on rates markets.

Equity FPI outflows amounted to \\(\\) 3.2b\\(in August, over\\) \\ \\(14b\\) YTD. Higher tariffs, no real attempt by Modi to change behaviour re Russian oil and a market that has tried to sell USDINR a handful of times already this year leaves the market less willing to step in despite the NDF approaching 88.50. RBI sold a fair amount at 88.00 in the NDF during August (our estimate was\\) \\ \\(10b\\) ) and are likely to have been active as we' ve broken higher. We' ve been here before with this dynamic where come maturity of the NDF contracts between the market and the RBI, the market community has to replace the seller of USD (RBI) with someone else – assuming the RBI don' t roll. This creates natural short- dated NDF points (and o/r) demand unless a private USD seller steps in – this keeps NDF/NDS yields elevated versus OIS equivalents in the short- end. This has implications for the demand for XCCY receive positions (3yr sat at +68bp) and related products (SSA paper) which sit near a 150bp pick up to comparable IGBs on a post tax- basis.",

In the latter, its unambiguously negative for Thai growth prospects – though they weren’t great to begin with so the ‘delta’ to the new ‘news’ should be fairly limited.

There is a strong argument here that the bulk of whatever easing we can expect from CBs to be finished by the end of 2025, if not by Q126. Will whatever is delivered be enough to create positive growth impulses into 2026 or will fiscal have to bear the load? I have long been a believer in the framework that Asian curves rarely steepen in cutting cycles – there is little evidence that cycles go deep enough or correlate with fiscal easing to justify pricing higher forward rates. Inflation is almost never an Asian problem and growth drags tend to be multifold in terms of real rates being too high, and fiscal on the whole disappointing in its implementation. Indeed; last week we had the BSP cut to 5%, but signal the cycle was potentially nearing an end (for what its worth, we still expect them to cut to 4.5%). The BOK shifted forecasts higher for 2025 and 2026 but 1 more member tilted in favour of a rate cut within 3mo to bring the total to 5 out of 6 members of the MPC. The curve however sold off marginally and terminal pricing remains pinned at 2.25% - ie, just 1 more cut that the market fully expects and thus prices to be delivered in the October MPC.",

If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the offered Product, the price quoted by Goldman Sachs would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, and the quoted price (and the value of the Product that Goldman Sachs will use for account statements or otherwise) could be higher or lower than the original price, and may be higher or lower than the value of the Product as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs. If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase the Product or otherwise values the Product, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, if you sell the Product, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. Goldman Sachs may conduct market making activities in the Product. To the extent Goldman Sachs makes a market, any price quoted for the OTC derivative transactions, Goldman Sachs may differ significantly from (i) their value determined by reference to Goldman Sachs pricing models and (ii) any price quoted by a third party.

However, these are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other considerations that should be taken into account in relation to an investment. Investors should consult their own advisers before considering an investment in emerging markets. Investors should also note that it is a feature of emerging markets generally that they are subject to rapid change and the risks involved may change relatively quickly. Political and Economic Risks Emerging market countries are by definition \"in transformation\" and they are therefore more exposed to the risk of swift political change and economic downturns than their industrialised counterparts. Indeed, in recent years, many emerging market countries have undergone significant political, economic and social change. In many cases, far- reaching political changes have resulted in constitutional and social tensions and in some cases instability and reaction against market reforms has occurred. With respect to any emerging or developing nation, there is the possibility of nationalisation, expropriation or confiscation, political changes, government regulation, uncertainties as to the status, interpretation and application of laws, possible lower levels of disclosure and regulation, social instability or other developments (including war) which could affect adversely the economies of such nations or the foreign exchange rates. There can be no assurance that in the future such factors and in particular political changes will not adversely affect the economic conditions of an emerging market country. Political or economic instability may affect investor confidence, which could in turn have a negative impact on the creditworthiness of the Asset Issuer, the value of the Assets and on foreign exchange markets.",
