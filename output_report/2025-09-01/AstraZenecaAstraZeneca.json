Baxdrostat showed a \\(8.7\\mathrm{mmHg}\\) and \\(9.8\\mathrm{mmHg}\\) placebo- adjusted reduction in systolic blood pressure at Week 12 in BaxHTN, which was met by a round of applause from the audience at the ESC Congress. The discussant also described baxdrostat's efficacy at Week 12 as \"clinically meaningful\" and also highlighted the durability of efficacy with the 2mg dose, which showed sustained blood pressure lowering through to Week 32.",

However, we believe this is likely due to the enrolment of a more challenging patient population in the BaxHTN trial, including lower enrolment of females, inclusion of more resistant hypertension patients and including patients with lower kidney function (eGFR) at baseline, which when taken into account suggests the products' efficacy is comparable. More importantly on 24 hour ambulatory SBP, exploratory efficacy in BaxHTN in c. 20 patients per arm showed a \\(14.6\\mathrm{mmHg}\\) placebo- adjusted reduction for the \\(1\\mathrm{mg}\\) dose and a \\(16.9\\mathrm{mmHg}\\) placebo- adjusted reduction for the \\(2\\mathrm{mg}\\) dose, which we see as encouraging for the Bax24 Phase III readout in 4Q 2025 (primary completion: Sep 2025) and as potentially differentiated from lourdrostat, which in the Phase IIb Advance HTN study showed a \\(7.9\\mathrm{mmHg}\\) placebo- adjusted reduction in the \\(50\\mathrm{mg}\\) dose arm.

Efficacy on ambulatory 24 hour blood pressure was measured as an exploratory endpoint in 20 patients for the 1mg arm and 17 patients for the 2mg arm compared with 19 patients in the placebo group. This showed a 14.6mmHg placebo-adjusted reduction in blood pressure for baxdrostat 1mg, compared with a 16.9mmHg reduction for the 2mg arm, which we see as encouraging for the 24-hour systolic blood pressure trial for baxdrostat, Bax24, due to readout by the end of this year. This is superior to lorundrostat efficacy on 24-hour systolic blood pressure in the Phase IIb Advance- HTN trial which only delivered a 7.9mmHg placebo-adjusted reduction at Week 12. We note 285 patients were enrolled in the Advance HTN trial (comparable to actual enrolment in Bax24 of 217 patients), though the Advance HTN included 63% uncontrolled and 37% resistant hypertension patients compared with c. 73% resistant hypertension patients enrolled in BaxHTN. That said, we still see the 14.6mmHg and 16.9mmHg placebo-adjusted 24 hour ambulatory SBP efficacy as confirming the benefit of baxdrostat's longer half-life and encouraging for the upcoming Bax24 readout (primary completion: Sep 2025), which has the potential to provide differentiation vs. lorundrostat.",
