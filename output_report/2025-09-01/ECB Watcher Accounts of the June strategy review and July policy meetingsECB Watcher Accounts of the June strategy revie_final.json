      "text": "AspectHawkish InterpretationJustification from TextSymmetry of Reaction FunctionStrong emphasis on acting forcefully and decisively when inflation rises above target.&quot;the recent high-inflation period had shown that a forceful reaction was also needed when inflation rose above target and there was risk of an unchanging of inflation expectations.&quot;Lessons from Past DelaysClear acknowledgement that delaying tightening can be costly and fuel inflation.&quot;the Governing Council had been forced to raise rates very sharply to compensate for a delay in starting the tightening cycle. This delay had been costly, however. According to this view, it had fuelled inflation further, posed financial stability risks and given rise to additional central bank losses...&quot;Critique of QE Side EffectsSignificant attention given to the negative consequences of large-scale asset purchases (QE).&quot;the change in the interest rate environment had resulted in significant losses for the Eurosystem... the prolonged period of asset purchases had led to a scarcity of government bonds... residential property prices had increased by nearly 50% from the start of QE... the stock of purchased assets had a persistent effect on the policy stance, as risk premia remain compressed...&quot;Higher Bar for Future QESuggestion that future large-scale QE should be used more sparingly due to its diminishing returns and non-linear side effects.&quot;it was questionable whether side effects had indeed remained broadly contained. The recent experience suggested that the bar for large-scale QE needed to be higher in future, as the benefits were state-contingent and diminishing, while the side effects rose non-linearly.&quot;Exceptional Nature of Unconventional ToolsView that unconventional instruments, particularly QE, should be considered exceptional.&quot;some of the unconventional instruments, such as QE, should be seen as exceptional.&quot;Monetary Policy Efficiency and Soft LandingHighlighting the success of forceful tightening in achieving disinflation without a severe downturn.&quot;the forceful monetary policy tightening in response to high rates of inflation had been key in bringing inflation back towards target in a timely manner by firmly anchoring inflation expectations and averting a wage-price spiral, while ensuring a soft landing. Such a benign outcome was a major achievement...&quot;Data-Dependent ApproachEndorsement of the shift to a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach, which allows for quicker reactions.&quot;a major change had been adopted in the ECB&#x27;s reaction function in switching from forward guidance to a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach in 2022. This flexibility supported taking timely decisions amid high uncertainty.&quot;",

Rehn thinks inflation is \"for now in a good place\", and Nagel thinks interest rates are at a \"very good level\". The resilience of the economy continues to be a focus, and the economy is evolving in line with what Governing Council members expected. But that doesn't mean policy will not change if needed. Several members, including more hawkish members like Nagel also note that the ECB can react flexibly if needed. Kazimir also acknowledges that a major hit to the labour market could force the ECB to act. Therefore, while further cuts do not seem part of the Governing Council's baseline, their data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to setting policy does not rule out a further cut if it is warranted. EU-US trade deal: There seems to be signs of agreement across the hawk-dove spectrum that the EU-US trade deal has reduced uncertainty but has not eliminated it. Lagarde has described the deal as \"close to\" the assumptions built into the baseline of the staff projections, and \"well below the severe scenario\". Exchange rate: Views on the exchange rate's impact remain mixed. Villeroy thinks the euro's appreciation has a \"significant disinflationary effect\". However, Nagel thinks that the euro is not causing concern is it is still near its long-term average.",

      "text": "Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have shorter- term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer- term ratings. Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls ideas on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/), and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call idea represents a high- conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near- term or medium- term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12- month view of total return or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company- specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst's judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors.

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",
