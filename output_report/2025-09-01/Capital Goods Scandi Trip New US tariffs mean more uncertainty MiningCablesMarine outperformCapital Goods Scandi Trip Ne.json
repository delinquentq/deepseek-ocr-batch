In the latter, management see a 2H step up in growth thanks to delivery of orders taken in the industrial (warehouse) segment earlier in the year.- Residential recovery will be much more gradual however. Pockets of \"green shoots\" have been seen in areas such as Sweden, supported by interest rate cuts, and encouragingly management signal U.S. residential has stabilised, though questions remain on the volume outlook near-term as tariffs increase overall building / renovation costs.- Tariff related pricing is expected to be 3-4% across Assa's US exposure. Interestingly, management expect price increases to maintain gross margins and not merely match the dollar cost increase. That said, underlying price vs cost tailwinds that have supported margins in the past several quarters are set to reduce.- M&A pipeline remains buoyant with focus areas including adjacencies and scaling or consolidating focus regions e.g. the U.S. and India. Interestingly, management continue to expect China to shrink in importance along with the deteriorating property market and appears to be de-emphasised from a capital allocation perspective. Though looking further ahead there is an expectation that Chinese competitors look to enter European markets more meaningfully.- Financial algorithm unlikely to change at the CMD; management continue to believe the 5-10% sales growth rate (excluding FX) and a 16-17% adj EBIT margin are the right targets for the business.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
