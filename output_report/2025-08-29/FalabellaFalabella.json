Looking at 3Q25E run- rate under CMF accounting (which is not a perfect reflection of how Falabella reports, particularly on provisions), net income is tracking to \\(\\sim \\mathsf{CLP}\\mathsf{S}60\\mathsf{bn}\\) , flat y/y and \\(\\sim 15\\%\\) below JPME, yet we flag that this includes just one monthly datapoint. Results continue to be driven by strong NII, tracking \\(13\\%\\) y/y (- \\(2\\%\\) below JPME) and controlled SG&A (tracking \\(- 1\\%\\) y/y and \\(- 3\\%\\) below JPME). On the flip side, the run- rate of provisions is tracking above expectations (+ \\(34\\%\\) y/y and \\(14\\%\\) above JPME) given a faster- than- expected pace of loan growth, while taxes are also tracking higher. In this context, July loans crossed at \\(\\sim \\mathsf{CLP}\\mathsf{S}4,389\\mathsf{bn}\\) already \\(4\\%\\) above our expectations for the full 3Q25 and growing \\(15\\%\\) y/y (vs. \\(6\\%\\) for the Chilean system), while NPLs remain under control at \\(2.7\\%\\) (vs. \\(3.2\\%\\) in July- 24).
