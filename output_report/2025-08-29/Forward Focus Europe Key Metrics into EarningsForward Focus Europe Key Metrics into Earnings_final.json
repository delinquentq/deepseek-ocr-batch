Gross Profit margin was &quot;marginally below H1&#x27;24 at 58.8%&quot;, with a non-cash one-off charge related to inventory and FX headwinds offsetting measures to improve GM, and increased adoption of CapEx purchases by customers. If we assume a GM of 58.0%, this would imply GP of c. €61m, c. 4% ahead of cons. and 3% ahead of JPMe. If we were to assume the one-off inventory charge was -€2.4m, this would imply an underlying GM of -€0.8% in H1, which would be encouraging for H2 and FY GM exceeding 59%. ONT noted that the company remains on track to achieve FY25 guidance for 20-23% LC Revenue growth and Gross margin of 59%. Given the strong H1 performance, we expect Consensus to remain towards the upper end of the FY25 guide of 23% LC which, with a 3% FX headwind, implies Revenues of €219m, c. 1% below latest BBG Consensus.James D GordonPharmaceuticals &amp;amp; BiotechnologyPartners Group (OW)H1&#x27;25Revenues (CHFm)1,103.00Our H1 25E earnings expectations are broadly in line with consensus. We expect H1 25E revenues to stand in line with consensus, with management fees 1% below consensus being offset by slightly higher than consensus performance fees. Our H1 25E EBITDA forecast stands 1% above consensus on our expectation for slightly lower costs, but our EBIT forecast is in line with consensus as we expect a higher level of D&amp;amp;A than consensus. Our H1 25E net profit estimate stands 1% below consensus on our expectation for a slightly lower financial result. We would highlight, however, that our 2025E net income estimate stands 4% below consensus driven mainly by a 4% lower management fee estimate than consensus, as we believe consensus may be underestimating the impact from a lower USDCHF at end June for H2 management fees. We expect the focus on the day to be on the outlook for management fee margins and performance fees in H2 25, as well as any colour on fundraising momentum, in particular around the evergreen programmes.Angeliki BariakariEBIT (CHFm)667.00Diversified Financials",

On the outlook, we expect guidance to be unchanged on FY26 rental revenue growth and gross capex. However, we see scope for the FCF guidance to be increased to $2.2-2.5bn (from $2.0-2.3bn currently) as a result of the cash benefit from the new US federal tax legislation.

Net flows should improve for 1H25, mainly due to the life business given an assumed recovery PruFund net flows as well as better flows in Institutional Asset Management compared to 1H24. Adjusting for market movements, we expect flat AUM overall across the life and asset management businesses. We forecast a 227% Solvency II ratio (vs. 223% in FY24), reflecting 13ppts of positive capital generation in 1H25E, zero impact from market movements (as we assume that increased volatility offsets the impact of positive equity market performance), and a net negative 9ppt impact from other factors (dividends, a positive impact from DTA and tax).Farooq HanifOperational capital generation (Emn)389.00InsuranceLinkAfter a very strong start to the year (Q1 GGR growth of +8.2%), we see momentum in Q2 moderating slightly (JPME +4.8%), partly as a result of tough Betting comps (Euros related) and softer momentum in Lottery. On the profitability front, we expect a sequential improvement in EBITDA margin, modelled at 35.2% (vs 34.8% in Q1), up c.75bps y/y. The first quarter (we understand) was a bit of an anomaly, with margin coming in below the company's c.35% FY guidance, mainly as a result of stronger-than-expected competition during the quarter, which prompted higher marketing spend. This trend seems to be subsiding from Q2 onwards.OPAP SA (OW)Q2Q2 GGR growth (%)4.80LinkKaran PuriQ2 EBITDA margin (%)35.20Leisure, Hotels &amp;amp; GamingLinkSwiss Life (UW)S1Adjusted profit from operations (CHF mn)824.00LinkWe are raising our estimates for operating profit by -0.5% over 2025-27, to allow for growth momentum in the French non-life business due to pricing trends, offset by slightly lower fee results due to lower growth trends in Germany and France. We expect operating profit to reduce by ~7% in 1H25E vs. 1H24 due to asset management. This is mainly due to an expectation of ~16% lower asset management operating profit in 1H25E vs. 1H24 due to lower non-recurring commission income. We are forecasting a ~5% growth in Gross Written Premiums in 1H25, as we expect the good momentum in GWP growth in 1Q25 to continue in 2Q25E. In Asset Management, we forecast CHF13bn of net new third party assets in 1H25. This follows the strong performance in 1Q25, but also reflects a strong level of inflows into lower margin 'index' strategies. We expect 9% lower cash remittances in 1H25E vs. 1H24, due to -CHF140mn one-off benefits last year. Swiss Life is set to deliver a Solvency II ratio of 194% at 1H25E (vs. 200% at 1Q25), mainly driven by 4ppts impact from the anticipated repayment of a hybrid debt.Farooq HanifTotal GWP (CHF mn)12,234.00Insurance",

Our H1 25 adjusted EBITDA forecast is 24% lower H/H (no company-compiled consensus available at this stage), largely due to a lower top line (as H2 24 had benefitted from substantialcatch-up fees which are not being repeated) and incrementallyhigher costs as the company is preparing for the next fundraisingcycle. Our Q2 25 fee-paying AuM estimate of €21.4bn is flat Q/Q,reflecting no incremental fundraising or exits in the quarter. On theday, we believe investor focus will be on management's guidance for the upcoming fundraisings of MidCap II, Next Gen II, and Fund VI,as well as any plans for additional strategy launches.Adjusted EBITDA (€mn)78.00ABF (N)Georgina Johanan, ACAGeneral RetailFY25 PreCloseTradingUpdatePrimark EBIT margin (%)Primark H2 LFL (% yoy)-0.50LinkWe forecast Primark H2 LFL of -0.5% (H1-2.5%), supported bymore favourable weather in the UK. With our LFL being within theguided range (JPMc FY 25 LFL -1.4% vs guide for -1% to -3%), we think there is little risk to FY 25 Primark margin guidance for broadly flat yoy. Furthermore we would note that management commented at the H1 25 results that it had \"assumed some unmitigated cost in the second half of this year\" from US tariffs (when the rate on China was set at 145%). We think this implies at least some 10s of bps ofsavings vs what was accounted for in guidance. We model FY 25Primark EBIT margin of 11.7% (FY24: 11.7%) and EBIT of €1,126m (in-line with BBG cons for €1,123m). Looking ahead, we expectmanagement to provide an initial view on the FY 26 Primark margin. We estimate at least 100bps of gross margin tailwinds from external factors (FX and freight, although we think the latter is much moredifficult to model reliably). On the other hand, pre-mitigations, weexpect 40bps of annualised pressure from US tariffs. Below grossmargin, the ongoing living wage increase in the UK is unhelpful inthe context of our expectation for an ongoing LFL decline. Combined with the potential need for investment in price perception, we thinkmanagement is unlikely to guide for an improvement in the Primarkmargin in FY 26 and we think guidance will instead be for a broadlyflat margin. Separately, worth noting that investor questions at theresults could focus on whether there is a need for price investment,and competitive environment (particularly amid the roll out ofInditex's value concept, Lefties).Q2 '25Q2 Sales ex-FX yoy (%)Q2 EBIT (€m)6.001,912.00LinkGeorgina Johanan, ACAGeneral RetailThe group entered the quarter with sales growth (1 May to 9 Jun)+6% yoy ex-FX. Since then trends across key clothing markets thatwe track have been mixed. Comments from Zalando suggest that Jul has improved (with the retailer reaching sales growth of +HSD% vs+5% in Q2). Whilst we think at least some of any Jul improvementwould have been discount driven, we expect Inditex (whose business model supports a stricter full price stance) to have been supportedby a halo effect. For Q2 overall we therefore model steady salesgrowth of +6% ex-FX. We also expect a focus on current trading(Aug and start Sep). For Q3 overall we model sales ex-FX +6%.Within this we expect Aug also +6% but Sep +4% to reflect that Sep-24 was particularly strong across the whole market. Below top linewe look for broadly flat EBIT yoy, in line with the Q1 trend, withgrowth weighed by FX. More broadly, we expect growth initiatives to remain on track and for management to provide more detail on plansfor the (value end) Lefties concept.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
