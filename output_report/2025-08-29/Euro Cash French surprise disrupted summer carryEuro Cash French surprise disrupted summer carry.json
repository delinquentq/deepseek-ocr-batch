Fitch will be the first to review French sovereign rating on 12 September (current rating AA- negative outlook). Fitch had put France on negative outlook in October 2024. In their last rating review in March 2025, Fitch had forecast French deficit for 2026 at \\(5.6\\%\\) and for 2027 at \\(5.4\\%\\) . Also, in their recent commentary post the French 2026 draft proposal from the Bayrou government in July 2025, Fitch highlighted that the proposed budget (2026 deficit projected at \\(4.6\\%\\) by the government) could improve fiscal outturns but given political constraints the government will find it hard to approve the proposal in full. Our base case is for no rating action from Fitch at the review, as by 12 September, it is unlikely to have much clarity on political/budget process and Fitch will likely want to see the final political/budget outcome before making a decision on a rating downgrade. A rating downgrade from AA- to A+ will be a modest surprise for the market, in our view, and would likely lead to some modest knee- jerk widening in French spreads (around 5bp in 10Y spread). For instance, Belgian spreads underperformed by around 4bp vs. core peers post the Fitch down",
