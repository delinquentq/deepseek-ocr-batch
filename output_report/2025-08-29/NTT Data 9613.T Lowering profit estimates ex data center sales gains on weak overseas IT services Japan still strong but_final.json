We have previously noted the challenging demand environment for overseas IT services, but NTT Data's European business has a high proportion of business that is susceptible to economic fluctuations, such as consulting, and utilization rates are declining more than we had expected. Based on earnings trends at Accenture, IBM, and Tata Consultancy Services, we think the business environment for overseas IT services will remain challenging.",

We therefore newly factor data center sales gains into our estimates. We assume c.¥144.3 bn (in line with guidance; to be booked in 2Q) will be booked under sales/operating profits in FY3/26, and c.¥100 bn annually from FY3/27 (incorporating these sales gains, we raise our FY3/26- 28E operating profit estimates by \\(38\\% /23\\% /21\\%\\) ). According to the company, gains on the sale of data centers are likely to be higher in the first year of NTT DC REIT's operation, as older data centers are sold off, so we assume data center sales gains will be slightly lower in the second year and beyond. We are Not Rated on NTT Data.",
