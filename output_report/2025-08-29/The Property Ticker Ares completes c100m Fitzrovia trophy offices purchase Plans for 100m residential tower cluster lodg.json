The acquisition is part of Ares's aggressive UK real estate investment strategy, following recent purchases such as 10 Brook Street for 43m and a significant industrial portfolio from Royal London Asset Management for around 200m. The office, previously owned by WELPUT and sold by Colliers, features a passing rent of 65 per square foot and tenants like CAA Sports and Bridge Real Estate Investments. With a weighted average unexpired lease term of 3.2 years to breaks and 6 years to expires, the acquisition reflects Ares's continued expansion in the UK market, leveraging opportunities for high- yield investments.

The plans, crafted by Euan Kellie Property Solutions for Forshaw Land and Property Group and Your Housing Group, include six multi- storey towers offering 504 homes with one-, two-, and three- bedroom options. The urban community will feature amenities such as retail space, a residents lounge, cinema, gym, coworking office, and a pool. The development aims to support the council's regeneration goals for the area south of Kirkstall Road. Lyndon Forshaw expressed confidence in the project's appeal, while Matt Ollier highlighted its design inspired by the site's industrial heritage. This proposal joins other major housing initiatives in Leeds, including Town Centre Securities' Merrion Centre redevelopment into a 37- storey student accommodation tower. (Source: CoStar)",
