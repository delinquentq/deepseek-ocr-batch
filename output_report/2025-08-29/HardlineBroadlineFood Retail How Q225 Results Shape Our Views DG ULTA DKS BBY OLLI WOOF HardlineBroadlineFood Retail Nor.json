DG's top- line is recovering from \\(\\sim 2\\) years of below- average growth, and strong Q2'25 gross margin performance (+137 bps y/y) driven by improvements in shrink, inventory markups, and damages is an encouraging sign. Comp and EPS guidance for 25 is achievable \\(\\sim 24\\%\\) and \\(\\) 6.05\\(at the midpoint, respectively), and we think the bull case presents meaningful upside as a return to algo comps (+2%- 3%) while also making progress toward a \\(\\sim 6\\%\\) EBIT margin largely through gross margin expansion yields mid- to- high teens % EPS growth in 26/27.

On the other hand, comps in 25 are benefitting from both easier y/y compares and competitor closures / share loss, which creates a more challenging set for top- line growth in 26. Further, SG&A deleverage could persist as wage inflation, store investments, and repair & maintenance costs continue to rise. Combined with the uncertainty of how consumers may respond to tariff- induced inflation in 2H25, this offsets the potential upside, in our view.",

The upside case is shaped by a top- line acceleration driven by \"Phase 3\" investments yielding a return to market share gains and stronger customer retention, while EBITDA margins continue to expand as WOOF prioritizes its retail execution efforts (i.e., disciplined promotions, enhanced customer experience, and price management). This momentum could drive \\(\\sim 40 - 50\\) bps of EBITDA margin expansion in '26/27 in the bull case, yielding \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) EBITDA growth in each year. However, with comps declining LSD% for the second consecutive quarter and expected to decline similarly in Q325, we see risk of an elongated comp slump in which the benefits from \"Phase 3\" investments take longer to materialize. While EBITDA margins can still expand in '25/26 due to WOOF's initiatives, an elongated top- line recovery likely limits EBITDA growth to \\(+\\) MSD% in '26/27. In addition, with the impact of tariffs slated to accelerate through the balance of the year, implied Q425 EBITDA guidance yields - flat growth y/y vs. double- digit growth in the prior quarters. Given an uncertain tariff and macro backdrop, there is risk the cost pressures continue into '26 and further limit EBITDA growth.
