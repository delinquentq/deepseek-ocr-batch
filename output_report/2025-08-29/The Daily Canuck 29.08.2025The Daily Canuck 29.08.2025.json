      "text": "Following EQB's Q3 miss, we are reducing our rating to Hold from Buy. Out of necessity, EQB is undergoing a major re- haul of its executive talent at a point where it is facing significant operational headwinds. While its business model is far from broken, we do not expect to see any immediate solutions to the pressures it currently faces. As such, we believe that its valuation will be compressed until the rough patch eases, and we recommend sitting on the sidelines. For our report, see \"EQB 3Q25 Earnings Review: Credit Headwinds Continue - Downgrade to Hold\". With CM and TD closing out the 'Big 6' Q3 earnings with beats, below are our key thoughts coming out of the quarter: For CIBC, we believe the bank reported exceptionally strong earnings as it did not receive the same tailwind from lower provisions as peers. Further, the bank did not call out non- recurring securities losses as non- core, further bolstering the quality of earnings. Key to sustaining and expanding its valuation multiple will be maintaining the success that it has achieved in its net interest margins, which we believe the bank will be successful at. For our report, see \"CM 3Q25 Earnings Review: Strong Finish as the CEO Rides into the Sunset\". For TD, although the bank's third quarter is arguably not as impressive as some of its peers, we believe that it is demonstrating solid progress in improving the profitability of its U.S. segment. Further, we are confident that the management team will provide compelling arguments for profitability improvements at its strategic update next month. While TD has enjoyed a strong year- to- date run, we believe that additional upside is still available. For our report, see \"TD 3Q25 Earnings Review: Steady Progress Rewards Bottom Line\". Closing out the banks Q3 reporting season this morning is LB, with consensus forecasting EPS of \\(\\) 0.72\\$ On the macro front, for this morning, Statistics Canada will release June and Q2 GDP data. Looking ahead, next week, a relatively quiet one for economic releases, with manufacturing PMI due out after Labour Day on Tues, while trade balance data is scheduled for release on Thurs.
