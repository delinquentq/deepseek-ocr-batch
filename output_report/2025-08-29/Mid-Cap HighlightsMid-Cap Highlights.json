A press release from Remy bringing up the bottom end of guidance represents the second upgrade from the company as tariff uncertainty has eased. If a deal is reached with the US, this should drive further upside (MSD net of reinvestment). Key positives today include (1) Reiteration of guidance MSD on topline (2) Reinvestment of approx half of the tariff windfall behind growth. There is no change to our view that cognac will recover over the med- term and that Remy will see recovery alongside this. Whilst visibility on timing of recovery is still low, tail risks are abating and Remy's cognac business appears to be bottoming. Shares are trading on 1.5x inventory value vs 10- year avg 4x.
