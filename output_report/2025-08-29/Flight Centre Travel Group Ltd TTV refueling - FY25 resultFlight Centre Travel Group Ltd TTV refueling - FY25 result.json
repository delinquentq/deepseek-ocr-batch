While TTV growth appears healthy, FLT have stepped away from providing full- year quantitative guidance with ongoing volatility and cyclical challenges continuing to be seen in early trade. Given the challenges, the company is focusing on cost discipline with benefits from GBS initiatives expected in 2H26 and a rectification of issues in Asia expected to lead to a recovery in Corporate margins.

FLT have not provided detailed quantitative guidance for the full-year, but have flagged they expect 1H profits to be \"fairly flat\" given the cyclical challenges and the strong Q2 pcp. Given the top-line headwinds we expect cost control/out will play a big part in delivering this outcome - particularly in the context of the significant drop in profitability in 4Q25. Improved growth/performance into 2H26 appears predicated on a stabilization in the cycle and benefits felt from easing economic/geopolitical pressures (rates, etc). It is worth noting the 2% UPBT margin target in this context as well. Group PBT margins fell 10bps to 1.2% in FY25 and on the earnings call management acknowledged achievement of the 2% margin target has been delayed.",
