NII was a beat, with CoF coming in better, and cost management was good, down 1\\% q/q. AQ has held up well, with NPLs and coverage almost flat q/q, while credit costs were higher at 36bps for the quarter. This was due to the faster pace of write- offs (M\\)303mn vs. M\\)236mn last qtr), likely led by Thai operations. Payout at 55\\% was a positive. These numbers suggest consistent core trends.

While top- line growth is crucial, the emphasis on managing cost lines (CoF, opex, and provisions) to achieve higher through- the- cycle RoE is notable. Key strategies include prioritizing deposit collection over loans, broadening fee collection, re- architecting processes to reduce costs, and reallocating capital towards higher RoRWA geographies and businesses. These initiatives, along with structural reforms in Malaysia, position the bank to achieve 11.4- 12.1% RoE and 4- 10% EPS growth over the next three years, leading to a re- rating.",

      "text": "- The bank's focus on cost management amongst others should deliver steady returns of 11.4-12.1% RoE, higher than Street forecasts. Hence, we believe the re-rating should likely continue.- The bank has delivered a good turnaround on the cost base, as well as AQ over the last couple of years. NIM is picking up on the back of lower CoF, with limited loan pricing power for now. Credit growth should be steady at \\(\\sim 5 - 7\\%\\) over 2025/26, with banks competing for quality borrowers.- CIMB is strategically prioritizing deposit collection over lending, with revised KPIs to incentivize deposits. This proven approach enhances deposit duration and pricing, setting a strong foundation for sustainable RoE.- We are forecasting credit costs of 27-31bps over 2025-27E (last 10Y avg 64bps), which factors in a reasonable degree of AQ resilience despite the mix shift towards structurally riskier commercial loans.- Management sees CET1 level of 14.5-15% as appropriate in the current operating environment, higher than the formal guidance of \\(\\sim 14\\%\\) . While the payout ratio may exceed guidance of 55%, a special dividend is unlikely to recur from here.- CIMB is effectively reallocating capital based on long-term RoRWA, focusing on high-return areas such as corporate banking in Malaysia and Indonesia. This strategic capital deployment is poised to maximize returns and drive growth.- The bank has among the strongest corporate relationships and holds top-tier positions in MYR ECM and DCM markets. This positions it well for a rebound in corporate credit issuance, as and when it happens.",
