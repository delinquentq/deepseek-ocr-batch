      "text": "CNY: A policy push, not a market pull. In our view, the most notable aspect of recent CNY strength is that it came seemingly without much FX market pressure. Unlike in recent episodes when fixings showed an appreciation bias, this one came when DXY was stable rather than rising (Exhibit 1). And when both CNY and CNH were already trading weaker than the CNY fixing, policymakers still moved the fixing stronger. Taken together with a jump in the FX conversion ratio in July, we think this shows the interplay between clear policy intentions and the response of market participants. There are good reasons for this—cyclically and structurally, as well as domestically and internationally. On the domestic cyclical side, our equity strategists think there is more room to run for the recent rally and see a wide gap between foreign investor interest and actual allocation. More structurally, CNY continues to screen as significantly undervalued, with the degree of undervaluation now comparable again to the period of the \"China shock\" in the mid- 2000s. While there is always substantial uncertainty around FX fair value metrics, recent economic performance—large export market share gains and a surge in the current account surplus—help corroborate these model estimates. Taken against a backdrop of shifting Dollar demand, continued CNY adjustments seem likely. This has important implications across FX markets, both because it takes some of the onus off the Euro to provide the Dollar depreciation impulse and because CNY is an important regional anchor for low- yielder currencies in both EM and G10.",

      "text": "- USD: A licking that keeps on ticking. The broad Dollar was relatively range-bound over July and August—a summer of carry, after all—but we think the forces that weighed on the Dollar in H1 are still active, and we increasingly see the required ingredients for a more sustained depreciation. We see the softening labor market as confirmation of the main thrust behind our view that the Dollar should fall further; the US is not outperforming the way it has for much of the last decade, and that warrants a weaker currency. More salient tariff effects will likely continue to weigh on US activity, and our economists expect more subpar growth ahead. Next week's payrolls report will be an important marker to gauge the extent of the slowdown so far and the likely policy response ahead. Fed speakers have taken some understandable solace from the steady unemployment rate, and this will be the most important factor for the initial market reaction next week (we think a rise above 4.40 is likely required to meaningfully jostle rates- and recession-sensitive crosses like EUR/USD and USD/JPY). But it is worth emphasizing that, from an FX perspective, a lower \"breakeven\" pace of jobs growth that keeps the unemployment rate stable is not necessarily a good thing; it can imply weaker \"potential\" and with it a lower short-term neutral rate—less \"recession protection\" required, but a longer way to normal and a less attractive investment environment. But, with the market already having moved some way to reflect this shifting outlook, we see two FX-specific developments that in our view help reinforce the Dollar downtrend. First,",

      "text": "global asset allocators dealing with the Dollar dominance in their portfolios are likely to continue to seek ways to hedge the FX risk that has contributed a large portion of the variance in international portfolios this year. This is especially true under swirling institutional governance concerns that often have negative FX implications in part because they reduce global investor appetite. Second, we think recent CNY management changes reveal an important policy preference that has broad FX implications given the Renminbi's important role as both a regional anchor and global benchmark. We have argued that, for Dollar depreciation to continue, it is likely that other regions will need to take the baton from the Euro, and that process now looks to be under way (see CNY bullet).",

      "text": "- EUR: Fade the French fiscal. The latest political developments in France have not shaken our conviction in a stronger Euro. On Monday, French PM Bayrou announced a confidence vote to be held on September 8. Major opposition parties have stated their intention to vote against the government, making it likely that the vote will fail and the prime minister will be forced to step down. Prediction markets now see over 95% likelihood that he is ousted by the end of the year. While these developments raise the focus on political negotiations earlier than expected, we think they are unlikely to materially alter the fundamental outlook for the Euro. Historically, Euro area political risks impact the currency only when there are clear signs of contagion or a lasting impact on real activity. Both seem unlikely, in our view. Our rates strategists see fundamental reasons to expect volatility and spillovers to remain muted. Additionally, the impacts to real activity look limited—our economists left their growth forecasts unchanged and only marginally raised their deficit target for next year, and they see a number of reasons why early elections still seem unlikely. Following the announcement, spillovers from OAT-Bund spread widening were low relative to historical relationships. But the Euro still weakened more than its typical reaction to spreads would suggest. EUR/USD typically weakens by about 4% for every 100bp widening in European spreads on average. We see a few potential reasons for the larger-than-expected move. First, spread widening in core Euro area economies like France tends to be more impactful for the currency than equivalent moves in periphery spreads. Second, spreads only tend to matter for EUR/USD when the moves are large and in focus, so the average beta tends to be too small when political volatility is elevated. Third, we think investors likely unwound some EUR/USD longs this week on the news. But we think the risks are limited and clearly outweighed by developments in the US which continue to weigh on the Dollar. Ultimately, we still expect the Euro to strengthen. Although we think other currencies will start to outperform after the Euro's leadership in the first leg of the Dollar's decline, that is mostly a function of progress so far rather than political developments.",

      "text": "Scandi FX: Poised for progress. We view the current backdrop as supportive for both NOK and SEK, and expect both to resume strengthening against the Dollar in the coming months—though we maintain a slight preference for SEK. We expect a steady continuation of Dollar hedging programmes and reallocations away from US assets from here, and the Scandis are still among the best placed currencies to benefit from those global trends. We also expect both EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK to grind lower toward our 3- month targets, and that should be aided by both crosses screening as slightly elevated versus cyclical fundamentals in our models (Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3). But our base case for a drift lower is finely balanced against the Scandis' exposure to a range of global cyclical and domestic risks. Relative to the Euro's recent trend of trading with enhanced safe- haven properties, both Scandis, but particularly NOK, should see sharp underperformance on a pullback in risk appetite or a continued slowdown in US data. For NOK, these downside cyclical risks are compounded by our commodity strategists' bearish base case for oil prices in the coming months. Further, while domestic macro should be less crucial for both currencies than these global trends, the Norwegian general election on September 8 is a key risk event for NOK. The most currency- significant outcome from the election would be from the success of a party or coalition aiming to loosen the current restrictions around channeling foreign currency revenues from the sovereign wealth fund back into NOK and into the domestic economy. Norway's Progress Party has been campaigning on that mandate, and, if successful, would open up a larger right- hand- side tail for the currency. In our view though, given historical resistance to altering the fund's mandate, and current polling that suggests a low probability of any given party reaching a majority, significant wealth fund reform remains a tail outcome for the currency.",

We have been recommending that investors go short EUR/CHF to fade the negative currency reaction to US tariffs on imports from Switzerland, which we did not think was justified. We think that US importers will find it difficult to substitute away from Swiss goods in the near term, so the currency does not need to adjust to keep production competitive. Since then, the cross has moved about halfway to our target as the gap to \"fair value\" in our GSBEER model has fallen (Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5). But other cyclical developments have also moved in favor of the Franc (Exhibit), which would also stand as a key beneficiary should French fiscal risks become more of a focus point than we expect (see EUR bullet). While the risk-reward has become somewhat less favorable, we still think this fade has a little further to go, especially when we also consider our economists' US labor market concerns heading into next week's data. As a result, we recommend that investors continue to target 0.93 on EUR/CHF, but manage the risk more tactically; we are moving the stop on our trade recommendation from 0.9475 to 0.94.",
