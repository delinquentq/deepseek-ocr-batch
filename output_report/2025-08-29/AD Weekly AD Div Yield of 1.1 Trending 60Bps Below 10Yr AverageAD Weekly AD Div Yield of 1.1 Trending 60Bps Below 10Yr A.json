Demand continues to outpace supply, especially for CFM56- 7B engines, while rising costs are prompting operators to favor shorter engine build standards over traditional long- cycle rebuilds. This shift reflects broader changes in asset strategy, driven by escalating OEM material prices and limited availability of used serviceable parts.
