Protesters reportedly attempted to break metal and concrete barriers, prompting the police to respond with tear gas and water cannons. In addition, the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute (LBH) estimated that 370 individuals, who participated in the protest were arrested, among them were students. The protest appears to have been organized via messaging and social media channels, urging the public to highlight issues such as tax increases, rising national debt, and worsening inequality.",

The president of the Labor Party said that about 5k people attended the protest in front of the parliament building in Jakarta, and the rest were spread across the nation. The protesters made six demands: (1) increase the 2026 minimum wage by 8.5-10%, (2) stop layoffs and eliminate outsourcing, (3) implement labor tax reform, (4) pass a new labor law without the Omnibus Law, (5) pass the Asset Seizure Bill, and (6) revise the Election Law and redesign the 2029 election system. In addition, workers also raised similar concerns as students over the parliament housing allowance. No clashes were reported and police seemed to have exercised restraint following Jakarta Police Chief Inspector urging personnel to prioritize \"a patient approach, and not to be provoked.\"",

The protests may also thus reflect growing public discontent despite the policy priorities of the Prabowo- administration on social assistance programs (e.g. the flagship free nutritious meal program, 3 million housing, village cooperatives etc). Further out, key demands of protesters may be difficult to meet, in our view. For example, legislating a new labor law may take time and raising wages may also be detrimental to businesses which, as we have noted, are also facing weak demand conditions (see Asia Insights - Indonesia: Postcard from Jakarta, 18 August 2025).",

As such, this could add to spending pressures and the overall fiscal deficit. Importantly, if protests are prolonged, these could limit prospects of structural reforms, particularly on labor market legislation, for which there is already some uncertainty over it being implemented after the Omnibus Law for Job Creation, which we argued was a landmark legislation to help liberalize labor markets and attract FDI, was rendered unconstitutional on 31 October 2024 (see Asia Insights - Indonesia: Uncertainty in labor market regulations rising sharply again, 3 December 2024). In terms of monetary policy, we see a rising risk of a delay in the 25bp cut we forecast by BI in September if balance of payments pressures persist as a result of increased political uncertainty due to the protests.",

While there remains local uncertainty over protests, we believe USD/IDR should trend lower in the medium- term because: 1) the impact of previous protests on IDR has been limited and short- lived. In previous examples of protests, depreciation pressures on IDR have been limited. 2) BI has remained active in the FX market, stabilizing the currency with interventions in FX spot, bond, domestic, and offshore NDF. Thus, a move higher in USD/IDR will likely be capped by BI. 3) Portfolio flows into Indonesia have been positive with MTD August equity inflows of USD744mn (1- 28 August), and bond inflows (1- 27August) of USD791mn; and 4) Powell was relatively dovish at the Jackson Hole symposium, which would likely keep the USD softer.",
