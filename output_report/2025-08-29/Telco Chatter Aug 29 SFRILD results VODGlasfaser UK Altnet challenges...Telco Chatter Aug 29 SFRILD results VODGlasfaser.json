      "text": "SFR released its Q2 results yesterday. Both financials and KPIs are weaker than expectations. We believe this will serve to further reinforce SFR’s need for market consolidation, supporting press reports that indicate the company is hoping to conclude a deal by year- end: (1) Revenues ex La Poste and Media €2,287m -9.0% y/y (Q1 -6.2%). Also excluding construction, revenues are -7.4% (Q1 -5.8%, Q4’24 -4.1%). The sequential worsening reflects a marked deterioration in residential service revenues -9.1% y/y (Q1 -6.7%, Q4’24 -1.8%) which outpaced the decline in SFR’s average customer base. Management attribute this to front book price pressures and reduced “other” fixed services, (2) EBITDA ex La Poste, Media and Datacentre €801m -10.8% y/y is similar to Q1 -11.8% (FY24 -9.4%), (3) Capex €378m -24% y/y. Hence, OpFCF €271m was “only” -4.3% y/y and management indicated they expect FY25 OpFCF to grow y/y with EBITDA declines more than offset by falling capex, (4) Net debt €21.4bn or 6.6x EBITDA. Pro- forma for the refinancing, net debt €15.8bn or 5.3x L2QA, (5) Against the backdrop of such weak trends, we reiterate our view that SFR standalone is only worth €16bn (see here), implying very limited equity value, and suggesting the only route to value creation is through in- market consolidation. Whilst Patrick Drahi is no doubt a shrewd deal- maker, against the backdrop of weak results, regulatory considerations, execution risks, and the size of the overall transaction, we have argued a price tag of >€20bn (6.3x EV/EBITDA) is more credible (though clearly weak trends can erode this level). We have published extensively on consolidation prospects (see here, here, here, here, here, here, and here).",

      "text": "Iliad reported its Q2’25 results yesterday. Key highlights included: (1) Q4 revenues: Growth rates across Poland and Italy are broadly unchanged. However, France has suffered another sequential slowdown with Q2 organic revenue growth +2.1% (Q1 +3.3%, Q4’24 +5.4%, Q3’24 +8.4%). In the mix, French service revenue growth is +0.9% y/y (Q1 +3.8%, Q4’24 +4.9%, Q3’24 +7.5%). The ~3pp q/q slowdown this quarter is greater than the 1.2pp slowdown at Orange and the 1.9pp at Bouygues, (2) No longer reporting French KPIs: Italian and Polish net adds have sequentially ticked up. However, in France management now only reported their subscriber base rounded to the nearest 0.1m, making it impossible to calculate net add trends, (3) impressive margin trends: Iliad has delivered record margins across all regions this quarter: France 44.7% (+3.6pp y/y), Italy 33.3% (+6.2% y/y) and Poland 46.1% (+4.3pp y/y). Looking at the company’s cost disclosure (P6 of the accounts), around half of the EBITDA growth seems attributable to “other income and expenses from operations” (split 50% tower BTS and other), whilst the other half seems to reflect operating leverage / cost control, (4) Consolidation: Iliad’s CEO at a press conference is quoted as saying “we didn’t have any discussions with Telecom Italia since the beginning of April, and these will come back… these perspectives are now behind us”. This has seen Telecom Italia’s shares -8% today. Investors will look to Iliad’s earnings call to provide more colour on the French Telco competitive environment, as well as the evolving dialogue around a potential SFR “break- up”, including whether this week’s political developments might in any way complicate an M&A process.",

      "text": "Vodafone Germany informed its dealers of a \"marketing freeze\" for services on the Deutsche Glasfaser network in the middle of August, according to a report by business magazine WirtschaftsWoche (WiWo). Vodafone had announced that it was starting to offer its products on Deutsche Glasfaser's fibre networks in October 2024. Deutsche Glasfaser says its agreement with Vodafone remains in effect but \"negotiations regarding wholesale terms are currently under way\". The report says that Vodafone calls Deutsche Glasfaser's prices above the market average and that under current conditions \"it is not possible to offer attractive deals\". It added that more could be behind the dispute, saying that two anonymous sources within sales told it that a conspicuously high number of orders with Deutsche Glasfaser generated by Vodafone had been cancelled, leaving Vodafone dealers without commission. Deutsche Glasfaser then concluded the deals directly, the sources said. WiWo commented that both companies deny this. One sales insider told WiWo there were problems even in the early days of the marketing agreement, as Deutsche Glasfaser connections could not be recorded in the system easily. This led Vodafone to sign more Deutsche Telekom contracts, the source said. WiWo pointed out that the timing of the Vodafone's supposed sales freeze roughly coincides with 1&1 announcing that it would market Deutsche Glasfaser connections at the beginning of August. In November 2022, Deutsche Glasfaser announced that it had signed a wholesale agreement with Vodafone that would run for at least 10 years. (Source: Telecompaper)",

The flexible data roaming plans, which can be used alongside your existing physical SIM and number, allows users to choose the amount of data they need and the number of days they’ll need it for before travel. The announcement claims customers can “save up to 96% with our prepaid data plans in over 160 countries”. The 96% compares Community Fibre eSIM for 1GB for 7 days in the US (£2.29) vs Vodafone’s daily roaming rates. The new service is being supporting by a new Community Fibre eSIM App and ISPreview notes that it doesn’t seem possible to bring up any pricing via the eSIM page on their website, which suggests that this may only be possible if you install their App first.

      "text": "The government has modified the Single Supplier Framework agreement that it awarded to Openreach (BT) last year under the Project Gigabit broadband roll- out scheme (here). The deal was originally valued at “up to” £800m and designed to help upgrade 312k premises in some of the hardest to reach UK areas to FTTP, but this has just been boosted in value to £1.2bn. The framework agreement was later followed by the gradual awarding of seven related Cross- Regional (Type C) contracts to Openreach covering poorly served areas. The seven call- off contracts that have so far been awarded under the framework agreement reflect a total of over £730m in committed public investment and nearly 300k premises. In addition, any future fibre build delivered through this framework won’t have to go through another competitive process each time. The government states that the reason for this £400m increase stems from: 1) The need for additional works, services or supplies by Openreach and, 2) Additional scope has been added to the contract in accordance with the UK subsidy control regime. This suggests that either the aforementioned contracts are going to be extended to cover additional premises or the roll- out is costing more than expected (possibly also a combination of the two), says ISPreview. However, it is also possible the framework may have needed some adjustment for other reasons, such as to compensate for the fact that a number of smaller altnets have recently either withdrawn or scaled- back their own Project Gigabit deployments.

This morning, Telia published the offer document. The acceptance period of the offer commences on September 1, 2025, and ends on October 17, 2025.

Bredband2 is the third- largest provider of fibre internet to Swedish consumers, operating in open networks. The offer is unanimously recommended by Bredband2's Board of Directors. The five- largest shareholders, holding about 50.2% of the shares, have committed to accept. The offer price represents a 37% premium over the last closing price.

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
