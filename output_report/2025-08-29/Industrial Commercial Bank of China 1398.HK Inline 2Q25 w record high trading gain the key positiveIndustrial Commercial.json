ROA/ROE were down -5bp/-48bp y-y to 0.65%/9.0% in 2Q25. ICBC declared an interim DPS of RMB0.1414/shr for 1H25 (-1.4% y-y), implying a payout ratio of 30% (unchanged y-y).",

Fee income remains muted, \\(+0.3\\%\\) y- y in 2Q25 (vs. \\(- 1.2\\%\\) y- y in 1Q25), likely dragged by weak settlement/guarantee fee income (which fell - \\(11.3\\% / - 21.6\\%\\) y- y in 1H25); Asset quality was mixed. NPL ratio was stable at \\(1.33\\%\\) (flat q- q in 2Q25), thanks to lower corporate NPL ratio (- 13bp h- h to \\(1.38\\%\\) in 1H25, w/ broad- based corporate NPL ratio decline h- h observed in 1H25 across all sectors except for property sector), helping offset the increase in retail NPL ratio by \\(+20bp h - h\\) to \\(1.35\\%\\) in 1H25 (due to higher NPL ratio across personal biz loans /credit card/ mortgage /consumption loan book, by \\(+35bp / + 25bp / + 13bp / + 12bp\\) h- h to \\(1.62\\% /3.75\\% /0.86\\% /3.75\\%\\) in 1H25).

While this resulted in a mediocre 2Q25 NPAT growth of \\(+1.4\\%\\) y- y (ranking slightly below Big6 banks, e.g. PSBC/ABC/BOCOM/CCB delivered NPAT growth of \\(+4.8\\% / + 3.2\\% /1.7\\% /1.6\\%\\) y- y in 2Q), we do not hold it against the bank as we see pre- emptive provisioning could help better ICBC for potential NPL formation increase in 2H25E, and create more room for provision release in 2H25 to help the bank still deliver at least a flattish earnings growth for full year 2025E (vs. ICBC's 1H25 earnings was down \\(- 1.4\\%\\) y- y, ranking below Big6 banks' avg in 1H). Worth noting, as ICBC is in the second batch of large banks recapitalization likely in 2026, this implies no equity dilution risk in 2025E. Against this backdrop, we flag that ICBC- A/- H 25E dividend yield of \\(4.2\\% /5.8\\%\\) looks attractive, ranking the 2nd highest/highest among A-/H- shr Big6 banks. Also, even factoring in potential equity dilution from recapitalization in 2026 (c.4.6% on our estimate), ICBC- A/- H 26E dividend yield of \\(4.0\\% /5.5\\%\\) still remain decent in our view.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"-\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note.
