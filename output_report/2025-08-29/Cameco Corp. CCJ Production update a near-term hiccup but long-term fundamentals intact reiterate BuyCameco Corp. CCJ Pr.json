      "text": "On 8/28, CCJ provided a production update, reducing forecasted 2025 production for McArthur River by \\(\\sim 3\\mathrm{mn} - 4\\mathrm{mn}\\) lbs (now 14mn- 15mn lbs). The company did highlight that there is potential to get an additional 1mn lbs out of Cigar Lake to make up some of the shortfall but is not base- casing this currently. While a near- term execution hiccup, we note risks to McArthur River was previously highlighted this year given development of new mining sites and impact from freezing conditions earlier in the year, and we view the production cut to be a positive to pricing in the near- to- medium term, somewhat offsetting the impact from lower production. Longer- term, given our view on the current U3O8 supply/demand dynamic which we expect will lead to higher pricing over the next several years, we see this production reduction as another positive in this regards supporting the structural deficit thesis. We reiterate our Buy rating on CCJ and highlight our takeaways within.",

      "text": "2025 production forecast revised downward. CCJ issued a production update to the 2025 production plan for its mining assets where CCJ is now revising down guidance slightly. We note that earlier in the year CCJ highlighted risks to McArthur River and Key Lake mill's production schedule which had the potential to impact the timing of production. In the current production update, CCJ notes that the company is unable to completely offset the delays relating to development and slower than expected ground freezing in the first half of 2025. As a result, CCJ is lowering its expectation of extracted lbs. from McArthur River for 2025. Production from McArthur River/Key Lake mill is now anticipated to be 14mn- 15mn lbs. (vs. 18mn lbs. prior) on a \\(100\\%\\) basis (implying CCJ's share is now 9.8mn- 10.5mn lbs). At the mid- point, the cut to McArthur river represents a reduction of 3.5mn lbs. or roughly a \\((19\\%)\\) reduction in production out of the mine. We do highlight that CCJ notes that Cigar Lake production has been strong this year and there remains a potential to increase production out of this asset and offset 1mn lbs. of the 3mn- 4mn lb. shortfall from McArthur River (on \\(100\\%\\) basis). We note that while this impacts current year production, we view this as an incremental positive for long- term fundamentals, supporting a structural deficit and higher pricing framework for U3O8 broadly.",

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
