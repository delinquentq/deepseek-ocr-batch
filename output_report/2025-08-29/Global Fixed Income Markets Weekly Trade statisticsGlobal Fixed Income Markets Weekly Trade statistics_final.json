NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this security because of either legal, regulatory or policy reasons or because of lack of a sufficient fundamental basis. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. Recommendations will be at the issuer level, and an issuer recommendation applies to all of the index- eligible bonds at the same level for the issuer. When we change the issuer- level rating, we are changing the rating for all of the issues covered, unless otherwise specified.
