      "text": "According to order receipt data for 50 major construction companies released on 29 August, building construction orders fell \\(29\\%\\) y- y (down \\(30\\%\\) in Japan) in July. Orders were down for factories, offices, and lodging facilities. We attribute this to a fallback from a concentration of multiple large orders for factory projects a year earlier and limited orders for redevelopment and other major projects booked in July 2025. We think orders for major redevelopment projects and factory projects may remain in a fallow period from July onwards, resulting in sustained y- y declines over multiple months. That said, general contractors have plentiful order backlogs, and inquiries about other projects, ie, inbound- related projects and data centers, look to have been solid, on which basis we envision sustained improvements in margins at the point of order thanks to a focus on margins. Civil engineering orders rose \\(14\\%\\) in July (down \\(3\\%\\) in Japan). In Japan, orders fell for roads, harbors, and airports. Road project orders from local governments and expressway companies declined. Expressway operators look to have been reining in new orders because of budget shortages, and we expect orders for expressway projects to continue to fall in August and beyond.",

      "text": "The construction start statistics for July, announced on the same day, showed building construction start floor space down \\(13\\%\\) , with residential starts down \\(9\\%\\) and nonresidential starts down \\(21\\%\\) . Among nonresidential buildings, start floor area was down for offices, warehouses, and factories. There were few large- scale project starts again in July, and we think that SMEs continued to rein in capex because of rising construction costs. The average building start price (projected construction costs divided by building start floor area, 12- month moving average) of \\(309,000 / \\mathrm{m}^2\\) was slightly up from \\(301,000 / \\mathrm{m}^2\\) in June (Figure 1). Average building start price was broadly flat for residential projects and up for nonresidential projects. For nonresidential buildings, average prices were down for manufacturing and lodging, but up for other categories including services, education, and transportation, and the mix also contributed to an improvement in average prices for nonresidential buildings as a whole thanks to a decline in exposure to the transportation sector, where average prices are low. We attribute the decline in average building start prices for manufacturing facilities to a decline in starts of large projects such as semiconductor and EV battery plants, which carry high prices. General contractors look to have continued to hike prices at the point of order, and major general contractors look to have received inquiries about an increased number of projects, up to those that would start around 28/3. With the number of special orders on the rise, in which projects are received without competitive bidding, we expect companies to continue to raise prices to pass through increases in labor and other costs and improve margins at the point of order.",

Shortages increased y- y for scaffolding workers but eased for form workers (building construction) and steel reinforcement workers (building construction). We attribute the easing in the shortage for structural work to the low number of redevelopment projects and smaller projects.

The shortage of plumbers increased m- m in Hokkaido, which we attribute to progress with major semiconductor- related projects as well as seasonality. We expect supply- demand for plumbers to slacken from 27/3 onwards as major semiconductor projects are expected to run their course in 26/3. Shortages of electricians have remained high in absolute terms, and we expect supply- demand conditions to remain tight as a result of an increase in work related to data centers and power transmission networks.",
