      "text": "Bottom- Line: The 2Q25 Inflation Report Q- QIR) is consistent with the policy signals conveyed at the Aug 7 MPC meeting and the respective minutes. The MPC became more upbeat on growth for 2025 (+50bp to just \\(0.6\\%\\) and also 2026 (+20bp to \\(1.1\\%\\) ). Following the firmer 2Q25 real GDP print the output gap is tracking at \\(- 0.8\\%\\) of GDP (not as wide as the previous \\(- 1.5\\%\\) forecast) and is forecasted to widen to \\(- 1.9\\%\\) (vs \\(- 2.5\\%\\) in the previous report) in 2025 and to \\(- 3.0\\%\\) (vs \\(- 3.6\\%\\) in the previous report) in 2026. The MPC forecasts show headline/core inflation reaching \\(3.7 / 3.7\\%\\) by end- 2025 with convergence to the \\(3.0\\%\\) target achieved by 3Q2026 (which we deem as too optimistic). A principal component analysis shows that slack conditions in consumption markets remain in negative territory (- 0.7%) and that the labor market remains tight (labor market slack at \\(+0.8\\%\\) ). The balance of risks for inflation around the projected path \"remains biased to the upside\" (though less so than in 2021- 2024) and the balance of risks for activity is \"biased to the downside.\" For the central bank, the US economic policy changes have added uncertainty to the forecasts, and their effects could imply pressures on inflation on both sides of the balance of risks. One of the analytical boxes shows that the behavior of monthly inflation and its volatility are currently similar to the pre- pandemic period, which suggests that the pandemic- related shocks have faded. In our assessment, the policy signal from this analytical study is dovish for future monetary policy decisions.",

The forward guidance hints at additional rate cuts: \"looking ahead, the MPC will assess further adjustments to the policy rate.\" The ex- ante real policy rate is now tracking at around \\(4.0\\%\\) , still above the \\(3.6\\%\\) upper- limit of the estimated neutral range, and sub- trend growth is expected to keep the output gap in negative territory through end 2026. In our assessment, the MPC has been downplaying high core- goods inflation and services inflation stickiness and seems inclined to continue to normalize monetary policy and keep the Mex- US interest rate differential tighter than the historical norm. There was no mention in the statement of policy neutrality or the terminal rate. We forecast another 25bp rate cut at the Sept meeting and expect the policy rate to reach \\(7.25\\%\\) by end- 2025.",
