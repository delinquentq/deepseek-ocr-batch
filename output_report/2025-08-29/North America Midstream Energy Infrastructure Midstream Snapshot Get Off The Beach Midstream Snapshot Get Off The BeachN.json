      "text": "Summer might be winding down but midstream activity has still not abated. Headlines included a Permian natgas pipeline FID (Eiger Express), asset sales (MPLX Rockies divestiture), index inclusions (KNTK), and additional assets reportedly being shopped (EPIC Crude) (Reuters,8/25). We found investors actually quite engaged this week; trading levels were still about \\(90\\%\\) of normal levels despite heading into the long weekend. Headlines are keeping investors active but so is the start of the fall conference circuit next week as folks prep to meet with management teams once again - hopefully with more clarity into the 2026 outlook. We believe it has been a challenging performance year thus far for the investment community due to the volatility. We'd like to offer an encouraging message into September but it might have to wait until October; September is the worst performing month for midstream over the last 10 years. Enjoy the long weekend!",

      "text": "What were people asking? 1) Why did MPLX get faded following the Rockies divestiture? Two factors came up. First, some investors pointed to the deal as confirmation that non- core / declining assets in the portfolio are weighing growth down. Second, others pointed to the potential for proceeds to be recycled into a purchase of EPIC Crude. 2) Who might be a logical buyer of EPIC Crude? As we just mentioned, MPLX has come up in our discussions with investors. PAA also came up as a logical buyer. That said, the NGL divestiture, which would be a likely funding source for any acquisition isn't expected to close until 1Q26. 3) Did DTM announce another Guardian Pipeline open season? Yes they did. The Company executed two additional precedent agreements with Anchor Shippers following the last open season and just launched a second binding open season. The second expansion size is still to be determined but Anchor Shippers must commit to a total of at least 200k dth/d over a 20- year term which points to a sizable potential second expansion in a matter of months. 4) Should we be worried about oversupply of Permian natgas egress? The question was spurred by the FID of Eiger Express, a 2.5bcf/d project expected in- service by mid- 2028. While the announcement came earlier than we would have anticipated, we're not overly concerned about long- term oversupply just yet. We estimate utilization for Permian egress will likely still sit at \\(\\sim 90\\%\\) toward the end of the decade once both Eiger Express and Desert Southwest enter service.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"—\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

Certain high- volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal or exceed the amount invested. The yield and average life of CMOs (collateralized mortgage obligations) referenced in this Product will fluctuate depending on the actual rate at which mortgage holders prepay the mortgages underlying the CMO and changes in current interest rates. Any government agency backing of the CMO applies only to the face value of the CMO and not to any premium paid.

If in doubt, investors should seek advice from a tax adviser. The Product does not purport to identify the nature of the specific market or other risks associated with a particular transaction. Advice in the Product is general and should not be construed as personal advice given it has been prepared without taking account of the objectives, financial situation or needs of any particular investor. Accordingly, investors should, before acting on the advice, consider the appropriateness of the advice, having regard to their objectives, financial situation and needs.
