Under accounting standards, this cash is treated as deferred revenue. But given it is essentially a downpayment tied to a future obligation (shop visits), some investors take different approaches: (i) \"Cash Is Cash\" - the most common approach, with no specific adjustments for LTSA, in line with the treatment of downpayments at other companies in the sector e.g. Airbus. We take this approach; (ii) Discount - given the LTSA balance is future revenue, there is both a future cost and profit element. Some investors therefore only include the future profit element (some even apply tax), dependent on LTSA margin assumptions (typically \\(\\sim 50\\%\\) ); (iii) Remove - some investors choose to conservatively remove the net LTSA balance completely from their FCF calculations. For context, management has guided to the net LTSA balance growth being in the £0.8- 1.2bn range medium term (lower- end nearer term, upper- end medium term). At the £1bn guidance midpoint, this would remove \\(\\sim 24\\%\\) of our cumulative £16.9bn of FCF 2025- 28.",

Safran is rightly the highest quality stock in the European aerospace sector today, and has been for some time. The quality of its Propulsion division is not be understated, underpinned by its \\(50\\%\\) share in CFM International. But the group has an underperforming Interiors business where it has allocated considerable levels of capital and management bandwidth over the years.
