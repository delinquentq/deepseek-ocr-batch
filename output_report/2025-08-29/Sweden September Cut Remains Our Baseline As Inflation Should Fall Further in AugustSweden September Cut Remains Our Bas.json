The final Q2 GDP print of \\(0.5\\%\\) qoq still fell short of the Riksbank's \\(0.9\\%\\) qoq expectations, and was partly driven by inventory accumulation. Retail sales and consumer confidence improved but remain at historically low levels. Besides, the latest seasonally adjusted LFS unemployment rate stood at \\(8.9\\%\\) in July, notably higher than the Riksbank's latest forecast. At the same time, we expect CPIF to be unchanged at \\(3.0\\%\\) yoy, and CPIF ex. energy to fall to \\(2.9\\%\\) yoy in August, still somewhat above the Riksbank's June projections but beginning to unwind the summer- related strength. As the August meeting minutes point to Riksbank's Executive Board members' openness to lowering rates further if the inflation acceleration proves temporary, we stick with our baseline view of a 25bp cut to \\(1.75\\%\\) in September, conditional on inflation developing in line with our expectations.",

First, the final Q2 GDP print came in at \\(0.5\\%\\) qoq, higher than the flash estimate of \\(0.1\\%\\) qoq and our expectations, but still notably below the Riksbank's projection of \\(0.9\\%\\) qoq. While household consumption grew by \\(0.4\\%\\) qoq and gross investment rebounded after a weak Q1, a big uptick in inventories contributed notably to the upside surprise, pointing to some stock build-up in the economy. Incorporating the Q2 final release, our forecast for 2025 annual growth now stands at \\(1.1\\%\\) , still notably below our estimate of potential. Second, retail sales remained broadly flat in July, printing at \\(0.3\\%\\) mom, with the level still depressed from a historically weak May print of \\(-4.3\\%\\) mom. Consumer confidence in the NIER survey improved for the fourth month in a row in August, but saw only a modest increase to 91.1. The economic tendency indicator also saw an uptick in August to 96.0.

While all members shared an assessment that the recovery is proceeding slower than expected and the labour market remains weak, the recent spike in inflation caused more concern for some than for others. Deputy Governor Seim, for example, cautioned that even though she \"shared the assessment that inflation is temporarily high,\" she feared \"it may surprise on the upside.\" At the same time, Deputy Governor Jansson acknowledged that \"if one only looks at economic activity, then it would probably be desirable to have an interest-rate cut at the August meeting,\" as opposed to Governor Thedeen, who sounded somewhat cautious during the press conference, saying that, if not for its broader mandate, the Riksbank \"may have had to consider a hike\".",

While we expect inflation to unwind the June uptick in the upcoming months, starting as early as the August print, and undershoot the target in 2026, uncertainty is still high.

      "text": "Differing Levels of Service provided by Global Investment Research: The level and types of services provided to you by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research may vary as compared to that provided to internal and other external clients of GS, depending on various factors including your individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communication, your risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g., marketwide, sector specific, long term, short term), the size and scope of your overall client relationship with GS, and legal and regulatory constraints. As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
