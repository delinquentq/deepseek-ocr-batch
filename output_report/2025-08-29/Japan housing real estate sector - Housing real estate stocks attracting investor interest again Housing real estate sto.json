      "text": "The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) reported a \\(10\\%\\) y- y decline in housing starts in July, marking a fourth straight month of decline. Housing starts from April 2025 onwards have been hit not only by a fallback from rush demand in March ahead of the start of mandatory conformity with new energy efficiency standards, but also by how long conformity inspections have been taking, especially at smaller contractors that had previously not been compliant with them. Demand for home purchases was weak even before the new legislation came into force and market inventories of built- for- sale detached houses were high too, but we think that developers are unlikely to provide major discounts on these houses, preferring instead to adjust inventories via a severe clampdown on housing starts. Iida Group Holdings [3291] and Haseko [1808] outperformed the TOPIX by \\(4.4\\%\\) and \\(3.8\\%\\) respectively in August, after Apr- Jun results provided evidence of improved margins at their housing construction operations. Elsewhere, Sumitomo Forestry [1911], which generates over \\(70\\%\\) of its profits from US housing operations, outperformed the TOPIX by \\(4.6\\%\\) on the prospect of a recovery in the US housing market thanks to rising expectations about lower interest rates, while Lixil [5938] outperformed the TOPIX by \\(4.7\\%\\) on the prospect of improved performance at the US business, which has been loss- making since 23/3.",

This marks the sector's first outperformance versus the TOPIX in four months. We attribute this to evidence in Apr- Jun results of strong performance in office leasing and condo sales and progress with initiatives to improve corporate governance. Mitsui Fudosan [8801], which has been overhauling its portfolio in a- no- holds- barred fashion in order to boost capital efficiency, outperformed the TOPIX by \\(10.6\\%\\) on the sale of the Nagoya Ekimae Building, Mitsubishi Estate [8802] outperformed it by \\(6.6\\%\\) on the sale of strategic shareholdings as part of its policy of getting rid of them entirely in principle and using the proceeds for share buybacks, and Sumitomo Realty & Development [8830] outperformed it by \\(5.3\\%\\) on the start of moves to sell \\(400bn\\) in investment securities and make effective use of \\(200bn\\) in non- prime assets. Tokyo Fudosan Holdings [3289], where we have raised our full- year forecasts, also outperformed the TOPIX by \\(6.3\\%\\) in August on evidence in Apr- Jun results of strong performance in its pre- owned condo brokerage and resale businesses.",
