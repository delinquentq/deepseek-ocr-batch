While this remains below the 2021 peak of 73.50mn units in terms of volume, we expect 2025 HDD shipment capacity to reach 1,595EB, surpassing the 1,345EB recorded in 2021. This reflects our view that NL HDD shipment capacity will continue to grow. Although quarterly NL HDD production will likely rise only moderately due to constraints in media and head manufacturing capacity, shipments of high- capacity models of 24TB and above are increasing, and ASP is expected to continue rising.",
