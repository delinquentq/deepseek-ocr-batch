At Jackson Hole, Chair Powell echoed our view that weak job growth sends a stall speed alert, and Governor Waller amplified this message this week, arguing that \"labor demand may be on the edge of a sharp decline.\" A near stall in private sector hiring growth is unusual during an expansion and heightens the risk that two potential drags interact in a disruptive fashion. First, this stall often reflects building pressures on firms - through tightening financial conditions or margin compression - that lead to a pullback in spending and hiring. Second, slower labor demand usually depresses household purchasing power and sentiment, promoting consumer caution. Our recent analysis showing that job count revisions tend to be persistent and pro- cyclical, reinforcing these concerns.",

But inflation is now coming down rapidly and this should allow central banks to embark on large and sustained policy rate cuts. After accumulating FX reserves in prior years, central bank reaction functions also appear to be changing, as they allow capital inflows and/or CA surpluses to drive nominal (and real) exchange rate appreciation and further help disinflation. An example of this came with this week's a larger- than- consensus 200bp cut from Egypt's central bank. The move comes after a soft July CPI print tamed concerns about recent regulated price increases. While some upside inflation risks remain, relatively high real rates in Egypt should allow for a further 300bp of easing this year. We also expect further rate cuts from Ghana (- 600bp) while Nigeria and Zambia are likely to commence rate cuts in 4Q25 and 1Q26, respectively.",
