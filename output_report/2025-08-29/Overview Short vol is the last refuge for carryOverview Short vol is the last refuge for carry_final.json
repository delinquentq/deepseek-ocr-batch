We find the recent repricing of political uncertainty risk premia to be broadly fair and expect the 10Y France- Germany spread to stay in the 75- 85bp range over the coming weeks (see Euro Cash). Moreover, in the Netherlands, the current caretaker government survived a confidence vote on Wednesday after fears of a government collapse (new elections were already scheduled for 29 October), even though market reaction to this news was marginal.",

We had expected that weaker growth would lead RBNZ to cut, but only after staying on hold through 2H25.
