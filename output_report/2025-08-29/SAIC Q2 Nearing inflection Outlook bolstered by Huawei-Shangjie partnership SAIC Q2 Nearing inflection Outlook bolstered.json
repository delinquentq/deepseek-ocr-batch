In February 2025, the collaboration was officially announced, and the joint brand Shangjie launched in April. The first model, Shangjie H5 with Huawei's ADS 4.0, began pre- sales on August 25 at RMB 169.8k, quickly securing 25k refundable orders in the first hour and 50k in 18 hours. The company is confident in achieving 100k deliveries in Q4 2025, a milestone that would mark a significant success. This ambition is encouraging and boosts our outlook for the company. Looking ahead, Shangjie plans to introduce two additional models in 2026. To support production, SAIC intends to re- purpose- idle capacity previously allocated to the Shanghai- VW JV. Beyond aiding SAIC's turnaround, this partnership holds strategic significance as the H5 is the first mass- market vehicle price- priced below RMB 200k) equipped with Huawei's ADS 4.0. This marks Huawei's officiatenty into the mass- market segment, leveraging its strong brand influence, which could pose a competitive challenge to the industry (continued page 2).",
