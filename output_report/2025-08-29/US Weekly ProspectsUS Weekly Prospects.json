The releases this week brought limited new insight into the labor market, though we will get a clearer picture next week with the release of the August employment report.

The Federal Reserve Act does not specify what \"for cause\" means, though a common interpretation is inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance while in office.

After accumulating FX reserves in prior years, central bank reaction functions also appear to be changing, as they allow capital inflows and/or CA surpluses to drive nominal (and real) exchange rate appreciation and further help disinflation. An example of this came with this week's a larger- than- consensus 200bp cut from Egypt's central bank. The move comes after a soft July CPI print tamed concerns about recent regulated price increases. While some upside inflation risks remain, relatively high real rates in Egypt should allow for a further 300bp of easing this year.

This would continue to showcase resilient auto sales following the downturn observed in May and June, as the earlier front- loading ahead of April tariffs began to wane. The team recently remarked that the expiration of US federal tax credits on electric vehicles could be contributing to growing demand, as affirmed by increased BEV penetration through July, along with an improved supply of luxury brands that had partially halted shipments since April. Our auto team will revisit its forecast next week as more data becomes available.",

As we discussed in a recent note, this is quite possibly sampling noise that will soon reverse. The data on unemployment by reason is seasonally adjusted separately and does not sum to the official change in the unemployment rate, which makes it challenging to estimate how much a reversal in this series would lower total unemployment. One possible approach is to note that when summing the unemployment data by reason, new entrants accounted for \\(60\\%\\) of the increase. Given the overall unemployment rate rose \\(13\\mathrm{bps}\\) a way of framing this is to estimate that new entrants accounted for \\(60\\%\\) of that \\(13\\mathrm{bps}\\) increase, or \\(8\\mathrm{bps}\\) and that a full reversal would cause the unemployment rate to fall by an equivalent amount.",

Along with the longer- run decline in youth participation there may be some residual seasonality in the last few years: since 2023 the rate has peaked in February and March each year, then declined into the summer, with troughs in July 2023 and August 2024. Were this pattern to repeat this year, it could contribute to a 20- 30bps increase in participation between now and early next year, holding participation constant for other age groups. In the short- term, though, it's possible that youth participation could edge down further in the August report, given the trough was in August last year.",
