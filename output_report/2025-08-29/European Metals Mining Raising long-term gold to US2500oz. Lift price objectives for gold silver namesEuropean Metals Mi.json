      "text": "For Gold & Silver companies, in particular, long- term prices matter because they are important drivers of a DCF valuation. Precious metal companies often (but not always) tend to own assets with shorter mine lives, so the market (and companies) tends to prefer a DCF rather than an earnings multiple as a starting point. We think that mining companies also use some assumption of long- term prices when considering capital allocation, both organic and inorganic, as well as when estimating reserves and resources. The price used by mining companies to estimate reserves is often a trailing average of c. three years. At year- end 2024, this trailing 3- year average was c. \\(\\) 2050/oz\\$ . By year- end 2025, this could have increased to c. \\(\\) 2500/oz\\$ .",

Companies with a track record of finding gold and growing reserves tend to be rewarded with premium multiples. Higher gold (and silver) prices = higher DCF. Accordingly, we raise price objectives. Higher cost producers (e.g., HAR) have more operational gearing and thus see larger increases.",

That said, we consider, at the margin, ongoing impact on supply driven by declining gold grades. With the recent material increase in gold prices, we think some companies with declining reserves may choose to \"fix\" their reserve \"balance sheets\" by lowering cut- off grades. This would mean structurally higher costs and ultimately an increased proportion of higher cost supply in the cost curve. Similarly taxes related to revenues and profit cause supply curve to steepen during periods of rising prices.",

      "text": "FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least \\(10\\%\\) and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0- 12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).",
