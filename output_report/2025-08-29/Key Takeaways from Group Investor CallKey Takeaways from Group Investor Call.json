TCOM launched AI tools which empower (a) large hotel partners tapping into inbound travel market; (b) small and low stars hotels can better serve international travelers with multi- lingual customer services. In addition, hotel partners can benefit from advice on improving business performance; (c) AI content generation drives better conversion (e.g. video generation); (d) hotel partners offer better value- added services with increasing average spending per traveler (e.g. spa, buffet). Different from general- purpose AI, TCOM leverages its huge in- house datasets and provides travelers with customized, real- time and authentic recommendations (e.g. travel itinerary). On the other hand, TCOM benefits from cost efficiencies and higher productivity with AI. On S&M, AI enables precision in marketing spending with better ROI and shorter time is taken in preparation of marketing material.",
