However, after a near- \\(60\\%\\) rally from the lows in late 2024, and with the shares now trading above our TP based on 0.7x price to book value, we believe that the risk- reward is now more balanced - with EU car sales demand slowing, with the potential for weakening EU used car residuals, and with potential volatility in French credit markets.

Very low expectations, tariff certainty, 'less bad' EPS momentum, strategic dialogue on EU C02 rules and increased restructuring savings FY26 vs 25 create positive risk- reward into seasonally stronger year- end, in our view. We continue to see Volkswagen and Porsche as good ways to position from here, sticking with our Buy ratings. The key risk remains any credit/macro deterioration moving into 2H25.",

Feedback from customers (distributors and contractors) showed the project pipeline in the industrial and commercial segments remained strong with quoting activity ongoing, but actual orders have been delayed with significant uncertainties on recovery. Higher profitability in NAM also means disproportionate impact on group EBIT from its sluggish outlook. Management expects 'below 16% margin' to be 'closer to 16% than 15%', hence likely between 15.5%- 16% in our view. While Russia market has also been challenging, the decline was already factored into original guidance and didn't impact the outlook downgrade. Pricing holding up well, and neither pricing nor input cost is expected to have a material impact on EBIT margin guidance.",

And while there will be a cost impact, this may well (in the near- term) be largely absorbed by further VAT recoveries in our view. From a strategic perspective, we think this (alongside the Stable acquisition) represents a concerted move into higher- margin business (and a different customer base) given mortgage market share pressures in Sweden, consistent with Investor Day pledges. We remain cautious on negative timing effects within NII/market share loss, yet this move can potentially shift investor focus to some extent.",

In Beverages, Q2 earnings were mixed, with volume misses in beer/soft drinks severely punished, however, with business models for both intact, any signs of an improving Q3 (esp. LatAm) should be supportive. We like Carlsberg and ABlnBev, with the latter likely to benefit from a new buyback with its Q3 results. In Spirits, clarity on tariffs is enabling investors to focus on fundamentals. Although near- term trading visibility remains low, prudent Campari estimates leave them well- placed to perform, while Diageo and Pernod's control of the controllables should limit downside risk. Tobacco remains our preferred subsector. Encouraging modern oral growth and increasing enforcement against US illicit vape should support most stocks. BAT is top- pick followed by PM and Imperial.",

Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"-\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share- price movement will not materialize as expected.",
