Outside sovereign bonds and PBoC bills, foreign financial issuers (FIs) and China LGFVs have been key drivers. Rising CNH issuance from foreign FIs is mainly driven by 1) the interest rate gap between the US and China; and 2) strong demand from mainland investors amid declining yields in China onshore market. China LGFVs, on the other hand, have been active in CNH market due to tightened onshore issuance. In the recent months, CNH bonds have become topical as we see more issuance from non- financial corps outside China LGFVs. YTD, RMB32bn CNH bonds have been issued by non- financial corps (ex- China LGFVs), up \\(30\\%\\) YoY, given the relatively low funding cost and increasing demand. For CNH corp bond issued in YTD25, on average, the CNH coupon rate is 35bp/19bp lower than comparable USD/EUR bond yields. In addition, some companies issue CNH bonds to meet RMB funding needs, like HK developers with investments in China mainland. On the demand side, it has been strong, given the attractive pick- up of CNH bond over other currencies and relaxation of Southbound Bond Connect (expanding eligible investors to China NBFCs). On a hedged basis, CNH bonds are now providing 22bp/13bp/6bp yield pick- up over CNY/EUR/USD bonds. With RMB depreciation pressure easing, we expect robust southbound inflows to lead to further compression. Within CNH universe, we find 1) HK financial and property are most attractive, while Chinese banks are most expensive, 2) HK and Singapore quasi are more attractive than China SOEs, and 3) foreign issuers' CNH bonds are cheaper than China/HK issuers with similar rating/duration.",

Although the Singapore tier- 2 space largely looks expensive with spread level at 50- 80bp, we still find the OCBC'35 attractive vs. peers on better relative valuation (RV) than peers, given 1) stronger fundamentals reported in 2Q25; and 2) the technical support should remain strong, in our view, on Singapore tier- 2.

Despite margin compression of 12bp in 2Q25, the bank's NIM stabilized in June and it could see slight expansion in 3Q25, thanks to the deposit rate cuts that should lower funding costs. Further, the non- interest income grew \\(5.4\\%\\) YoY in 2Q25 with wealth management business being the key driver. The strong fee income could partially mitigate the margin pressure (please see our equity report OCBC 2Q25 – slight beat; strong fees and AQ offset NIM pressure)",
