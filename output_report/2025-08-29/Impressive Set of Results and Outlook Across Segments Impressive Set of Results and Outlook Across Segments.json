(b) No. of 88VIP grew by double digits YoY, surpassing 53m. (2) Quick commerce. BABA achieves its first- stage goal for quick commerce, which is to scale up user growth and build consumer mind share.

      "text": "(c) Merchant supply. The rapid growth in business scale attracts new merchants to onboard Taobao Instant Commerce. High-quality merchant supply has reached industry-leading levels. It is actively onboarding Tmall brands' offline sites to Taobao Instant Commerce, enabling one-stop online-offline operation for Tmall brands. EABA expects to onboard about 1m branded offline stores over time. (d) Riders. Daily active riders have exceeded 2m, 3x higher vs Apr, which means it creates over 1m new jobs. (e) Lightning warehouses. It has over 50K lightning warehouses with order growth of over 360% YoY, 25% of which comes from supply chains within the Alibaba ecosystem. (f) Synergies with e-commerce business. Quick commerce is a significant driver to overall user scale and engagement. In Aug, quick commerce drove 25% growth in the Taobao app's MAU. E-commerce benefits from quick commerce in: (i) advertising and CMR driven by traffic growth; (ii) savings in S&M expenses as a result of increased user activity. (g) UE can be improved by optimization of customer mix, order mix, as well as fulfillment efficiency and costs. In the short run, BABA expects UE losses can be narrowed by half with logistics and subsidy efficiency improvements and order structure optimization. In the long term, it believes quick commerce will bring sustained positive economic value to the overall platform while maintaining price competitiveness. (3) AIDC. (a) AIDC achieves solid progress and approaches breakeven while sustaining strong growth momentum. (b) Strong AIDC growth was driven by the strong performance of cross border business. (c) With improvement of operational efficiency, Choice and Trendyol have UE improvement sequentially in the quarter. (d) Going forward, BABA will improve operational as well as efficiencies to improve profitability. (4) AI. It highlights that LLM are evolving from chatbots into agent which handles long context and complex tasks, creating new opportunities for infrastructure provider. As a cloud vendor, Alibaba is well positioned with broad industry coverage, sandbox environments (e.g.new product AgentBay) and continuous model upgrades to support agent adoption. Strong coding and system integration capabilities are seen as critical to solving highly customized enterprise tasks, while Alibaba's broader ecosystem (such as Taobao, Amap, and Alipay) provides additional tools to automate workflows and embed agents into real business scenarios. (5) Cloud. The growth of Alibaba Cloud mainly comes from (a) high demand for training and reasoning since enterprises have more use cases and shift traditional workloads to LLM capabilities. (b) Enterprises have strong demand for post-training, especially in verticals like automotive, media, and healthcare. Management expects China's cloud market to concentrate to a few players, favoring vendors with full stack capabilities across traditional cloud computing, compute storage, AI compute and models. Its priority is to grow user base and expand into more use cases instead of short-term margins. Management reaffirmed its RMB380bn three- year AI investment plan, with flexibility for quarterly fluctuations due to supply or policy changes.",
