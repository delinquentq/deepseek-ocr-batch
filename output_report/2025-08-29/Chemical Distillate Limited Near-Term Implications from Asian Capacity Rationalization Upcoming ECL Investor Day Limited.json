      "text": "Following up on last week's initial announcement that South Korea will cut 2.7- 3.7mmt of naphtha- cracking capacity (NCC), Reuters reported a follow- up article noting that small and stand- alone crackers are likely the targets of capacity rationalization. Korean producers noted they are evaluating a range of options including capacity closure. Trade sources including S&P Global have already reported earlier in June that HD Hyundai and Lotte Chemical are seeking to merge their naphtha- cracking facilities in Daesan, though companies have not confirmed the consolidation yet. We view limited near- term market impact from Korea's capacity rationalization due to consultants currently expecting the restructuring timeline to take 12- 18 months. Furthermore, S- Oil's Shaheen refinery- integrated petchem complex with 1.8mmtpa ethylene capacity is slated for a 2026 start- up, likely offsetting some capacity closures.",

Separately, the team also noted that on China's phase- out of aging petrochemical facilities, all crackers \\(>20\\) years old are currently owned by Sinopec and PetroChina, which have upgrade plans for \\(>7\\) sites. Also, with a structural imbalance due to declining gasoline/diesel demand, there will likely be a limited impact on the E/PE chain.",

We largely expect management to reaffirm and expand on its three key financial targets set at its most recent Investor Day in 2023: 1) \\(20\\% +\\) operating margin, 2) 12- 15% long- term EPS growth, and 3) 5- 7% organic sales growth. With management already reiterating the 12- 15% adj EPS growth algorithm in 2025 and 2026 and hinting at 2025 operating margins to reach 18% and expand to \\(20\\% +\\) by 2027 due to growth in high- margin businesses, value pricing share gains, and productivity improvements during the 2Q25 earnings call, we believe management will provide more color on the path to margin expansion. We currently bake in a \\(\\sim 170\\) bps margin expansion from FY25 to FY27 and model \\(\\sim 14\\%\\) EPS growth in both FY25/26 (our note here).",

(ICIS, 8/29/25)- According to market sources, Dow has delayed a turnaround for its Plaquemine, LA cracker until 2Q26. The LHC3 unit was originally scheduled for maintenance beginning in August and expected to run through September. The unit has an ethylene capacity of 1.055mmpta and a propylene capacity of 390kpta. (ICIS, 8/28/25)- LYB's La Porte, TX unit with 1.2mmpta ethylene capacity and 286kpta propylene capacity was reported to be shut down earlier this week due to a process gas compressor issue. According to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the investigation to identify the root cause of the event is ongoing. (ICIS, 8/25/25)- India's Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) begun work including land acquisition and other pre-project activities on its new 9mm tonne/year greenfield refinery and petrochemical project. The complex is expected to have an ethylene capacity of 1.5mmpta. BPCL also indicated that its brownfield expansion of the Bina refinery project including a 1.2mmpta ethylene cracker is on track for completion by mid-28 and expects to produce 1.15mmpta of PE and 550kpta of PP and other chemicals like benzene, toluene, xylene, and others. (company press release, 8/26/25)- Citroniq announced it is targeting its proposed world's first commercial-scale renewable PP plant to start-up in 2029. The company signed a supply agreement with ABB, which will provide automation, electrification, and digitalization solutions once Citroniq makes a FID. The plant's operations will begin by dehydrating corn-based ethanol to produce ethylene, which will be converted into propylene and subsequently into PP.

      "text": "Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return (\"ETR\") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"—\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.
