      "text": "FRO posted adjusted 2Q25 EPS of &#36;0.36, coming in below our forecast of &#36;0.39 and the average Street estimate of &#36;0.44. Despite recent strengthening of VLCC and Suezmax spot rates, FRO's 3Q-to-date fixtures across those two asset classes are tracking below our projections, leading us to lower our 3Q25 EPS estimate to &#36;0.17 (from &#36;0.29 - we note the Street currently stands at &#36;0.41, and this figure will need to come down materially as others update for the 3Q rates). The 2Q dividend of &#36;0.36/share, though representing a 100% payout ratio, also fell short of expectations. Yet, the stock was up more than 1% today, likely given limited investor attention on the unofficial start of a holiday weekend (cue: \"if a tree falls in the woods and no one hears it\" riddle). At the end of the day, FRO is still the most highly levered public tanker company to improving VLCC and Suezmax spot rates, an outcome we believe remains likely given increasing OPEC exports and a still-muted near-term capacity delivery schedule. The leverage is there, but it appears to be another quarter into the future. We are lowering our full-year 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates to &#36;1.31 (from &#36;1.51) and to &#36;1.40 (from &#36;1.49), respectively, and our price target remains at &#36;22. We maintain our Outperform rating on FRO.",
