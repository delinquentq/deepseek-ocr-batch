Our impression is that a growing number of investors are taking a cautious stance on the stock amid concerns about the risk of further share sales by a major shareholder (as was the case last week (link)) and potential near- term acquisitions/alliances (many investors appear to think the company may be in negotiations, given the lack of share buybacks (link)).

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal clients websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
