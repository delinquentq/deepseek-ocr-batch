We have had a structural bearish OAT & bullish BTP view for a while, motivated primarily by the improving external position of Italy and deteriorating external position of France, which was not reflected in relative valuations.  \n2. In early March we temporarily closed our trade due to reasons related to the rising importance of defence for Europe, laid out in our piece In defence of OAT. In early summer, we re-initiated a BTP/OAT tightener as we were entering the period during which political risk could materialise.  \n3. This political risk is now materialising and we have reached our target on the trade (10bp on BTP/OAT). Hence the emerging question is where do we go from here.  \n4. From a valuation perspective, we reconfirmed recently that the external position is indeed empirically the best forward looking indicator with higher predictive power than Debt/GDP or credit ratings.  \n5. OATs are now trading cheap not only on our Twin Deficit metric but on every other metric as well. France is finally pricing political risk.  \n6. How far could it widen vs Bund? If we take last year as a reference, there are three important differences: i) RN is, at least in principle, becoming more fiscally conservative, ii) Defence is a greater market focus and iii) Germany is spending.  \n7. On that basis, one could think that last year's widers, 80-85bp on 10yr OAT/Bund (using Bloomberg spline), should be a reasonable ceiling rather than a floor.  \n8. On the Italian side, valuations remain favourable on all metrics except for Debt/GDP. But i) Debt/GDP has relatively weak forecasting power and ii) even vs Debt/GDP, Italy is only marginally expensive. In sharp contrast to France (and maybe Spain), there is no political risk on the horizon.",

While losing the AA credit rating and move to single AA has no bond index eligibility implications or ECB eligibility problems, it's still considered as an important downgrade which could lead to outflows from real money investors.

We provide a regular update on the evolution of developed market (DM) rates markets in the recent past. Considering the uncertainty surrounding trade and fiscal policy, we begin by comparing budget balances and current account balances across major DM countries. We then analyse the distribution of outstanding bonds by investor type to assess the proportion held by price- insensitive investors, such as domestic central banks. Moving to market pricing, we examine pricing trends of major central banks, followed by recent market movements in key rates products. Finally, we update our cross- country PCA of term premia, as well as the seasonality of selected rates instruments. Definitions, methodologies, links to our key views, and recent publications are provided in the appendix.",

In addition to the conventional twin deficit calculation, which is simply the sum of the projected Budget & Current Account deficit of each country data from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) database, we have also created a \"twin deficits score\". For each year, the twin deficits score is a weighted average of the previous years' twin deficits. We assign a higher weight to this year's Twin Deficit (t), followed by gradually lowering the weights of the past five years (t- 1, t- 2, ..., t- 5) twin deficits and finally adding some weight to the cumulative twin deficit up to year t- 5. This allows us to create a synthetic twin deficit score which combines both the most recent flows and the historical stock of budget & current account deficits. Considering the fundamental difference between Norway and other G10 countries, we make adjustments to Norway's twin surpluses and NIIP when mapping with its market pricing.",

Governors Waller and Bowman - two Trump appointees who are also being considered for the chair position - dissented in favor of a rate cut at the July FOMC meeting and will likely continue to push for easing at upcoming meetings. Stephen Miran, who is currently chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and has been nominated to replace Kugler, is expected to add another dovish voice to the near- term policy debate (see \"What Miran means for the race to replace Powell\").

Nonetheless, with support for potentially steep rate cuts likely a prerequisite for candidates to replace Cook, another Trump appointee on the Board would add reliable voice for easier policy, even in the face of higher inflation that is to come. Indeed, the potential for four dissents from Governors - a majority of the Board - could intensify internal pressure for easier policy ahead.",

Historically, the Board has set IORB at an appropriate level to maintain the fed funds rate within the target range set by the FOMC. But, theoretically at least, a Board with a majority that did not agree with the FOMC decision could set IORB at a different - in this case lower - level. If the goal is to achieve lower rates, and the FOMC is not supportive, one unprecedented way to do that would be through this channel. That said, there may be limits to the related impact, as the FOMC sets the ONRRP rate and could continue to do so with a goal of keeping overnight repo rates near its target range. That would create unprecedented dynamics in money markets but potentially mute the impact of lower IORB out the curve.",

However, this need not continue to be the case.

This empirical observation fits with intuition and market positioning, that an overly accommodative Fed is likely to result in a twist- steepening of the curve. Threats to Fed independence are likely to lead to higher inflation expectations and inflation risk premia, and potentially make investors wary of owning longer- term Treasuries. This twist- steepening is in fact what occurred last evening and this morning in response to the news of Cook's removal. Our preference is to express this through lower front- end real yields versus higher long- end nominal yields (see \"Summary of key US rates views\").",

Firstly, the shift in supply/demand summarised by our global free float continues to point to upside, which is further supported by the fiscal stance at the global level. Secondly, the risks to Fed independence support a higher risk premium. Thirdly, China seems to have opted for a (gradual) focus on domestic demand rather than further support to exports by implementing \"anti- involution\" measures and allowing its currency to appreciate. Fourthly, after all, the term premium is still at its pre- 2014 historical low, and the conditions that led to a low term premium environment in the 2014- 2020 period (relatively tight fiscal policy, positive supply shock to oil prices, central bank QE) are reversed (structurally easier fiscal policy, negative supply shocks, central bank QT, immigration controls and tariffs).",

Deutsche Bank provides liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have shorter- term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer- term ratings. Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/), and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high- conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near- term or medium- term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12- month view of total return or investment return as described herein.

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Unlike an actual performance record based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate.
