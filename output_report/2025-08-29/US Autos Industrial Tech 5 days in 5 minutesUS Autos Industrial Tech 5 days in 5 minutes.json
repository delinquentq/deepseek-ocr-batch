Key highlights from this week included: 1) Tesla launched its Model Y Performance variant in Europe, which we believe will be key to monitor with Tesla's European registrations down \\(40\\%\\) yoy in July per ACEA, and its share lower than BYD's last month; 2) the IRS released guidance on claiming the EV tax credit that allows for delivery of a vehicle after 9/30 to qualify if there is a binding contract and down payment in place by 9/30, and we think this will support a longer tail of IRA purchase credits than we previously expected; 3) AV updates from Tesla in Austin and a partnership between Aurora and McLeod; 4) Vertiv acquired Waylay NV, although terms were not disclosed; 5) Nvidia earnings provided important context on the state of datacenter demand; and 6) ChargePoint announced the first product in its partnership with Eaton.",
