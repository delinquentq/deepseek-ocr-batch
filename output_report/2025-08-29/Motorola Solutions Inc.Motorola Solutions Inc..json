During the event, MSI discussed attractive opportunities for the company presented by the recent \\(\\) 4.4B\\(acquisition of Silvus (which was completed earlier this month), strong demand/budget backdrop across public sector customers (and potential tailwinds form OBBBA), product innovation - led growth across all three technologies, margin expansion levers (despite tariff headwinds), and M&A framework among other topics. We walked away from the meetings with incremental confidence in overall and demand fundamentals and MSI's ability to accelerate product orders growth in H2 (these were two key concerns for investors). More importantly, the meetings reinforced our view that Silvus will be a transformative asset for MSI that will provide the company with a more entrenched position in the defense vertical.

Although the deal is strategic in nature, we are equally impressed with Silvus' financial contribution to MSI's growth profile (\\) 475M in revenue - expected to grow 20% in CY26) and EPS accretion (neutral in partial year for 2025 but accretive by - \\(\\) 0.20\\(next year despite investments in go - to - market, R&D, government affairs, etc.). 2) Demand/Budget Backdrop Remains Strong Despite Concern Surrounding Public Sector Spending: At a state and local level, management indicated that budgets tied to public safety continue to be positive. At the federal DoD level, management called out a - 12% y/y increase in spending and 18% increase in procurement. Lastly, the recent passing of OBBBA should also create incremental tailwinds. 3) Attractive Innovation- Driven Growth: While end market fundamentals remain strong, it is important to note that growth is also being driven by MSI's innovation across their portfolio. Within LMR, LTE capabilities on the APX NEXT radios provide MSI with opportunities to monetize additional software applications on the device. The recently introduced SVX body-worn assistant also provides strong software attach opportunities with the added benefit of potentially displacing incumbent BWC vendors (when contracts renew). AI is also being embedded and monetized across Video and Command Center. 4) Confidence in Product Orders Acceleration: Strong pipeline, normalization of buying behavior (post pandemic), new products should drive orders accel. 5) Financial Execution: MSI's focus on margin expansion (despite trade- related impacts) and ability to drive FCF growth > revenue help fuel the company's value- add M&A engine.",

Although it is too early to quantify benefits of this bill, management noted that they could see orders related to OBBBA as early as Q4 of this year. Within LMR, MSI sees potential for increased spending to result in demand for more LMR devices, body- worn cameras, and live translation capabilities offered on their new SVX body- worn AI assistant (SVX can address both BWC and live translation needs). Increased DoD spending is a positive for Silvus. Lastly, there is potential for bonus depreciation of capex to provide some benefits for enterprise video customers.",
