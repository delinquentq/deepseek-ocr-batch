Improvement in Jul- 25 RevPAR is consistent with recent commentary from various hospitality REITs, and was driven by a \\(1.6\\%\\) YoY increase in ADR to \\(\\mathbb{S}\\mathbb{S}274.2\\) and a 1.9pts rise in occupancy to \\(91.5\\%\\) . There seemed to be more pricing discipline by the hoteliers in July versus prior months which saw YoY declines between April and June. We believe that there may have also been uplift from the World Aquatics Championships in July, which saw attendance of 140,000 spectators, with an estimated 40,000 international visitors (link). For 7M25 RevPAR remains down \\(2.9\\%\\) YoY to S \\(\\) 222.7\\(. Overall, with 3Q25 RevPAR likely to be down YoY owing to the shift of the Singapore F1 to October from the typical September period, we expect results for the hospitality REITs to be soft this quarter. Thus, we reiterate our Neutral ratings on CLAS and FEHT, owing to their flattish DPU profiles. We also maintain our Underweight rating on CDREIT, due to the impact of AEls and supply headwinds in New Zealand and the Maldives which we think will result in further earnings disappointment (link). Our FY25/26E DPU estimates are \\(3\\% /8\\%\\) below the Street. Link(Source: J.P. Morgan)",

Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analyst's coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.",
