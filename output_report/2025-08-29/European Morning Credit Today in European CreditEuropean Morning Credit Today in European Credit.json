The discussion comes in the context of the upcoming autumn budget. Details of implementation are unclear at this stage (whether through cutting remuneration on reserves, a windfall tax or an increase in the existing bank income tax surcharge). We believe the impacts on bank profitability are unlikely to be sufficiently large to materially dent the bank's credit stories. Yet uncertainty on the profit outlook will be unhelpful for the sector. See running rings around. (RT/LG)",

The holding will generate a profit of c. 244mn for UniCredit next year. By contrast to investments in Banco BPM and Commerzbank, UniCredit's stake in Alpha Bank has generally been welcomed by political authorities. The increased stake highlights UniCredit's optionality to raise its investment further. While unlikely at this stage, a further increase could support Alpha spreads. Alpha's fundamentals have materially strengthened but in our view remain a step below domestic peers', in particular on profitability and impaired loan coverage. We have MW recommendations at best on Alpha Bank as we see better value elsewhere in the Greek complex. (RT/LG)",
