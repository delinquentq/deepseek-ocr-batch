EUR vol curve has inverted amid uncertainty around the French confidence vote and the potential subsequent developments but the lack of clarity on the overall timing of the process hampers further gains in event risk premium. Efficiently hedge the risk by buying 6M EUR/USD - EUR/PLN vol RV or get an exposure via EUR/USD 30d put vs sell EUR/PLN put (ie own EUR/USD risk- off and away from EUR/CEE skewness). x- leg should be better behaved either way, but mitigates the decay in event of a swift resolution. Favorably, the long USD leg participates in the US centric noise.",

The upcoming confidence vote for the French PM on Sept 8th is another event risk that is starting to attract attention, at least in the narratives, although remains modestly priced, with an average of 35bps for EUR/G10 (Figure 2) and close to 42bps for EUR/USD, amid the tendency to hedge the risk via EUR rather than on the crosses. If not for the timing uncertainty of potential outcomes following the vote which muddies the event risk pricing, the dayweight would probably be able to get to 55- 60bps breakevens (14vols, ie 3- 4 higher from here).",

Looking at the aggregate event risk premium baked into USD/FX (Figure 9) turns out that pricing is relatively more concentrated into European G10 currencies vols, with EM and Antipodeans lagging.
