The market is yet to react to the risk of full Fed control, as there are still uncertainties over the removal of Lisa Cook (Cook's removal would likely give Trump the support of four out of seven Fed Governors). Some market participants, whom we have discussed Fed risks with, believe Trump would likely retract his push on the Fed to ease aggressively if the move higher in longer- tenor US rates leads to a sharp sell- off in US equities. While possible, we would likely need to see a sharp sell- off in equities first for Trump to step back.",

Today, onshore spot USD/INR decisively broke above the market's perceived key level of 88.0 and above the historical high of 87.96 reached on 10 February 2025. We continue to see a solid rationale for this position to outperform: 1) USD/INR's break above historical highs suggested that the RBI does not have a line in the sand on defending INR, though the RBI will likely continue to smooth the move higher in spot. Indeed, we previously noted that the market may be overestimating just how much and how long the RBI will protect INR, given US- led policy shocks; 2) the EU's secondary sanctions aimed at imports of Russian oil is a new near- term risk for India. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said secondary sanctions aimed at Russia's energy sector would be most effective in curbing Moscow's ability to wage war against Ukraine (Bloomberg, 29 August). Bloomberg also reported (28 August) that the EU sanction package should be ready in a matter of weeks, and this could present an additional headwind for INR; 3) additional action from the Trump administration targeting India's imports of Russian oil also cannot be ruled out, especially as the Russia- Ukraine peace process appears to be stalling. Notably, Russia has continued with drone and missile strikes on Kyiv, in defiance of Trump's calls to cease fighting (Bloomberg, 28 August); 4) positioning risk from the corporate sectors' USD/INR topside FX hedges, if above 89- levels are breached. Our discussions with market participants suggest some risks to corporate sector FX hedges, where there has been buying of topside in USD/INR, with EKOs around 89 and \\(90+\\) figures. However, this may only lead to an incremental pick- up in USD demand if these FX hedges are knocked out, unlike the structured product- led selloff in INR in 2013; 5) August MTD (1- 26 August), India has seen foreign outflows of USD2.6bn from Indian equities, with a preliminary number for 28 August showing another USD440mn of outflows. We continue to see portfolio outflow pressures as tariff- related uncertainty remains. In addition to this, developments on PM Modi's visit to China (31 August - 1 September) for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, where he is meeting Xi and Putin remains a key focus ahead.",

A few recent developments suggest the pace of CNH underperformance against its trading partners' currencies may slow in the near- term: a) the daily USD/CNY fixing has drifted lower at a faster pace over the past week, although the PBoC has started to show some unease about the pace of RMB gains; b) improvements in China's major BOP flow dynamics and sentiment on Chinese equities remains positive, especially ahead of the Victory Day Parade on 3 September; and c) state banks' FX actions may have been more subdued recently, though the potential for re- accumulation of FX remains. However, we believe the slow down in CNH underperformance is likely temporary because: 1) the recent slowdown in state banks' FX purchases in July may be temporary given the USD bid in the month and some evidence of official FX accumulation. Indeed, if there is an official stance to increase FX reserve coverage and if history holds, we expect DXY trending lower and onshore financial institutions' FX deposits to increase strongly; 2) there are signs that the PBoC may be a bit concerned over the recent pace of CNH appreciation. First, our daily fixing model error (actual fixing minus our model prediction) was just - 258pips today (29 Aug), which compares with - 422pips in the previous session.

While there remains local uncertainty over protests, we believe USD/IDR should trend lower in the medium term because: 1) the impact of previous protests on IDR has tended to be limited and short- lived. We observe that in the previous examples of protests, depreciation pressures on IDR have been limited. 2) BI has remained active in the FX market, stabilizing the currency with interventions in FX spot, bond, domestic, and offshore NDF. Thus, a move higher in USD/IDR will likely be capped by BI. 3) Portfolio flows into Indonesia have been positive with MTD August equity inflows of USD744mn (1- 28 August), and bond inflows (1- 27August) of USD791mn; and 4) Powell was relatively dovish at the Jackson Hole symposium, which would likely keep the USD softer.

We continue to hold our KRW appreciation view because: 1) official confirmation that the US Treasury and Korean authorities are holding currency discussions. While we have not heard on this issue from the Korean delegation's visit to the US for the Trump- Lee Summit, BOK Governor Rhee said the FX discussions are ongoing with the US Treasury, and the US Treasury is also engaging with several Asian economies besides Korea (Bloomberg, 28 August). Governor Rhee also said that the BOK's FX intervention to limit KRW depreciation over the past 1- 2 years (i.e., sell USD; watch August FX reserves released on 3 September) may be viewed as desirable by the US Treasury. We would not rule out the risk that the US could push for currency appreciation among its trading partners, especially with our models showing that KRW is still undervalued by \\(- 9.8\\%\\) on average; and 2) we believe Korea's exports and tech sector should remain supported by strong AI demand and rising chip prices. Despite Nvidia's tepid forecast of its third quarter revenue, the media reported (Bloomberg, 28 August) that at least 10 analysts updated their 12- month price targets owing to resilience AI demand.

Other than a myriad of reasons for our medium- term weaker USD view, we see local factors providing some scope for TWD to appreciate because: 1) TWD has been the main laggard within the region since the start of July. DXY weakened by 2.1% from 1 July to- date, but TWD has depreciated the most by \\(- 2.4\\%\\) against the USD within the region; 2) we believe recent TWD underperformance and lower short USD hedging costs (i.e., less negative swap points) also offer Taiwan lifers and exporters an opportunity to consider increasing their FX hedge ratio and reduce their USD hoarding respectively. The FSC noted that the Taiwan lifers' FX hedge ratio (including proxy hedge) stood at 63.4% as of end- July (Bloomberg, 29 August), which is relatively low; 3) market expectations for TWD appreciation might rise with BOK Governor Rhee's comment that the US Treasury is engaging in FX discussions with several Asian economies besides Korea (see above). Similar to KRW, we would not rule out that the US could push for currency appreciation in Taiwan too, especially with our models showing that TWD is still undervalued by \\(- 7.4\\%\\) on average; and 4) relatively robust local fundamentals, supported by export resilience from secular AI demand.

Depending on the party leadership decisions about a possible resignation, including Secretary- General Moriyama, pressure on PM Ishiba to step down could intensify. Even if the assembly passes without any major political moves, an opinion- gathering process on whether to hold an early leadership election is likely to commence, suggesting that political uncertainty will likely persist in the near term. We judge the risk of a major dovish shift in Japan's fiscal and monetary policies due to political moves has been reduced, but we need to monitor developments carefully for the next few weeks.

Our long EUR/CHF trade initially dropped on the announcement of the vote, but has rebounded somewhat, and we do not expect the ongoing French political saga to weigh more permanently on the EUR, as the relationship between OAT spreads and the currency is relative weak and unstable, as foreign holders of OATs that choose to sell can shift into other EUR- denominated bonds. In June 2024 the OAT- Bund 10y spread jumped from around 45bp to 80bp in less than two weeks and EUR/USD fell by little more than \\(1\\%\\) . The latest jump in the yield spread is around half this size. The most negative scenarios for EUR would be if President Macron was unable to find a working coalition and ordered an election, or worse still, resigned himself. The latter, in particular, has a very low likelihood, in our view. French fiscal consolidation will be a challenge regardless, but the overall European fiscal picture is less worrisome. Apart from this, inflation data are unlikely to be a market mover, especially with ECB rate cut pricing for September having diminished considerably. But we still expect gradually improving economic momentum to now mean more cuts from the ECB this cycle, versus market pricing of a terminal rate around \\(1.75\\%\\) .

We think AUD/NZD could continue to grind higher, supported by stronger macro fundamentals in Australia, and perhaps by positioning too, based on CFTC data. However, it has already risen over recent weeks, broadly in line with wider short- end rate spreads, and we are reluctant to chase this higher, given the move to date, and as we think the New Zealand economy is in the process of bottoming out. We continue to see more upside for AUD/CAD, based on respective fundamentals and - just as important - our house view for a weaker USD trend.",

On 22 August, Canada decided to scrap some of its retaliatory tariffs against the US, effective 1 September, which is likely to reduce stagflationary risk in Canada. But since last Friday, the market's pricing for Bank of Canada policy rate cutting by end- 2025 is roughly unchanged at 25- 26bp, so the market hasn't viewed this news as significant. Governor Macklem also gave a speech regarding the Bank's review of its Monetary Policy Framework for 2026, though he reiterated that the BoC will continue targeting inflation at \\(2\\%\\) , and he provided no major hints about new core inflation measures. Overall, amid the USD- driven FX market environment and a softer USD trend still continuing, we expect CAD to underperform against the Antipodean currencies. Next week, Canada's jobs report for August will be published on the same day as the US's, which could show some improvement from the previous month's weak print (was - 40.8k",

The market continues to worry about the supply of bonds (both IGBs and SDLs) in the market and remains cautious around auctions. Beyond the yield moves, we believe there are signs that the market has become somewhat disorderly (lower volumes, wider bid- ask, cancelled issuance, offshore- onshore spreads, etc). Furthermore, sentiment in the market is very poor, so, we believe that the RBI/GOI will likely soon take steps to support the bond curve. At a recent interview, the RBI governor noted how policy transmission through the government bond channel remains equally as important as the banking channel, and we published our view on what we believe is likely to be the tool of choice, noting bond buybacks or secondary market OMO purchases as favourites. Should such measures be announced we would look to add exposure in the 10y part of the bond curve, as we see scope for a 20- 25bp relief rally. Elsewhere, GDP rose \\(7.8\\%\\) y- o- y against expectations of \\(6.7\\%\\) . The NDOIS market has been much more rangebound, and we maintain our receive recommendation on the 2y NDOIS with a moderate conviction level (3/5), targeting a move to \\(5.25\\%\\) by end- September.",

Tuesday's auction continued to show strong demand from both onshore and offshore investors. The reversal was led by news of ongoing protests turning violent. Protests are very common within Indonesia, so protests are not a material risk; however, concerns over how new President Prabowo will handle them remains an unknown. In his address today, he tried to calm fears and provide some stability to the situation, though it clearly remains fluid and with more protests planned over the weekend, there could be a further intensification. Today's SRBI auction saw yields rise by 2- 7bp from last week and demand significantly lower.

Onshore funds bought back some long- end bonds this week, but if we look at August as a whole, the flow remains net selling (but smaller than July).

On bond supply, we expect net CGB and LGB issuance to stay elevated at \\(\\sim \\mathrm{RMB}1.2-\\) 1.3trn in September and October. Recent auctions showed weaker demand after the VAT recollection on interest income. Bond supply- demand dynamics are also supportive of higher rates in coming months.
