Newer products continue to see solid momentum, accounting for \\(- 50\\%\\) of quarterly bookings. Yet, revenue growth and gross margin were relatively in- line with Street expectations, while operating margin was 200bps above Street related to better cost management and internal efficiencies. On one hand, the stock is supported by a low valuation level, currently trading at \\(- 4.5x\\) c2026E EV/Sales. However, FY26 guidance remains uninspiring, with revenue raised by a mere \\(\\) 2\\(mn to overall\\) \\ \\(1bn\\) , roughly in- line with the Street, and OM lowered by 50bps to \\(3.0\\%\\) . We fine- tune our estimates to be more streamlined with guidance (see Exhibit 2). We maintain our Neutral rating and \\(\\) 21\\(PO.\\)",

The Company recently announced its SentinelOne Flex program, offering a flexible licensing model, which we believe will increase platform adoption and improve retention rates.
