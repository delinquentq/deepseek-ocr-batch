Of course this is as part of a trial, but we do think it validates the at home model, particularly given there were no physical study sites or in person visits. Worth noting this is on the legacy Zio XT system, with the newer Zio Monitor considerably lighter and easier for patients, making this compliance rate particularly encouraging.",

As a decently sized and remote trail, the AMALFI results are very encouraging, particularly in terms of time for diagnosis. In essence, the trial reinforces what was seen across other studies (AVALON, CAMELOT etc) that point to a patch solution being the way to go vs. a halter monitor, given the higher diagnostic yield, lower likelihood of repeat testing, faster time to diagnosis (both here and in prior trials which showed 9 days for Zio LTCM vs. 21 for non- IRTC LTCM). We're still at a place where in the US 40% of the 6.5mn annual tests are halter monitors, with a dramatically higher rate OUS, and as the clinical evidence continues to build for IRTC, we still see it as the long- term winner in the space. A very strong Q2 (+26% organic) and what looks to be comparatively conservative guide given the strength in the base business, as well as catalyst of MCT in 2026 are also supportive.",
