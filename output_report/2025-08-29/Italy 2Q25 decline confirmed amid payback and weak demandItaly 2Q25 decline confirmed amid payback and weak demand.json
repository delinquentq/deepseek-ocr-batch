The underlying details reveal a significant drag from net exports \\((- 2.7\\% - \\text{pts}\\) contribution) following a surge in 1Q25, primarily driven by the frontloading of sales to the US. An increase in inventories \\((+1.4\\% - \\text{pts}\\) cont.), which had been depleted in 1Q25 to satisfy export demand, only partially offset this drag. But the weak figures were also underpinned by subdued domestic demand \\((+1\\% - \\text{pt}\\) contr.) amid elevated uncertainty and downbeat sentiment, particularly among households, despite ongoing strength in the labor market and real income growth. Private consumption \\((- 0.2\\% q / q\\) saar) has broadly stagnated after three quarters of modest growth. Meanwhile, investment remained steady \\((+4.2\\% q / q\\) saar), as gross fixed capital formation continued to be supported by Next Generation EU investments. But it is also noteworthy that residential investment continued to hold up, increasing by \\(2.5\\% q / q\\) saar, despite the end of the Superbonus. A rebound in government consumption \\((+0.7\\% q / q\\) saar) also played some role in offsetting the trade drag and weakness in private consumption.",

The private services sector was mostly stagnant \\((+0.2\\% q / q\\) saar), likely reflecting a weak summer season. While IP data had suggested some modest expansion in 2Q25, the national accounts reveal that Italian industry contracted by \\(2.8\\% q / q\\) saar following two quarters of growth. This confirms that the recovery at the turn of the year was indeed significantly driven by a 'front- loading' boost rather than being entirely attributable to cyclical easing from the ECB, while structural challenges persist. On the price front, prices accelerated through the quarter \\((3.7\\% q / q\\) saar), but the annual growth rate of the deflator was left just a touch above the \\(2\\%\\) ECB target, at \\(2.3\\% \\text{oya}\\) . Growth in compensation per employee edged down to \\(3.4\\% q / q\\) saar in the quarter, but amid falling labour productivity, the growth in unit labour costs fell less markedly, standing at a still elevated \\(3.8\\% q / q\\) saar.",
