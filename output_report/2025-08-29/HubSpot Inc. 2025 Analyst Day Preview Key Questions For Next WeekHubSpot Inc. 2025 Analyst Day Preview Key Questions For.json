Following a difficult Q2 in Software, characterized by mounting investor concerns on GenAl disruption, we see an opportunity for next week's Analyst Day at HubSpot INBOUND (9/3) to prove a compelling catalyst. While HubSpot began to address these concerns on Q2 earnings, we think there are a number of Al- aligned topics investors are looking to be addressed in more detail, including: 1) broader impacts to the nature of marketing and the demand for HubSpot's offering; 2) how to gain comfort with seat- based pricing models; and 3) a timeline for when Al can prove accretive to overall revenue growth. We expect commentary on both near- and long- term financials to be lighter relative to addressing industry debates, especially given HubSpot revised interim margin targets higher at last year's Analyst Day (HubSpot, Inc: 2024 Analyst Day - Making Al Easy Breezy For Customers), and our analysis suggests FY26 Street estimates appear well positioned (more detail below). Given the largely negative sentiment in the current market landscape, we acknowledge that multiple quarters of consistent execution and positive estimate revisions are likely needed to improve investor willingness to underwrite the SaaS applications group. That said, we think management has the opportunity to highlight HubSpot's unique positioning across the group at Analyst Day. Below we address 6 key questions across GenAl impacts to marketing, seat- based pricing dynamics, revenue growth, NRR drivers, and margins ahead of the analyst day next- week.",

There are two core vectors on the debate around GenAl's impact to marketing at HubSpot: 1) the risk to HubSpot's top of funnel as it becomes harder for customers to find HubSpot, 2) the risk of lower demand for Marketing Hub ( \\(\\sim 60\\%\\) of ARR) as customers potentially spend less on INBOUND marketing strategies. #1 was well addressed during the recent earnings where HubSpot highlighted that SEO drives only \\(10\\%\\) of traffic, while the remaining \\(90\\%\\) comes from diversified sources like YouTube, Social, Newsletters, Podcasts. Further, upside to Q2 net customer adds (9.7k vs guidance \\(\\sim 9k\\) ) and the 2H outlook (targeting high end of 9- 10k) builds comfort that GenAl is not negatively impacting the top of funnel.

Given broader concerns about potential structural risks to seat-based SaaS models, we acknowledge multiple quarters of consistent execution and positive estimate revisions are likely needed to assuage the investor debate. That said, we see HubSpot well positioned to navigate risks given: 1) the Core seat, which provides the opportunity to better monetize HubSpot users who need access to the platform but may not necessarily need the specialized tools that come with sales and service seats (namely users in operations, and broader administration roles who otherwise would be going unmonetized); and 2) recent pricing model changes where the elimination of seat minimums drives smaller customer lands, though allows for customers to expand at healthier rates. On the former, our analysis leveraging: 1) 2023 Analyst Day disclosure on free vs paid seats (Exhibit 1); and 2) 2024 Analyst Day disclosure on starter tier customers as a percent of the total customer base suggests HubSpot could deliver \\(\\sim 2\\%\\) upside to Street estimates in FY26 if they successfully monetize \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) of unpaid users with Core Seats (Exhibit 2).",

At previous Analyst Days, HubSpot has provided a waterfall informing the build up to its NRR (Exhibit 3 & Exhibit 4). Parsing apart the building blocks, through 2022, HubSpot's elevated NRR was largely value driven, benefitting from strong cross-sell, upgrades, and churn moderation. Into 2023, the company saw NRR pressured to \\(\\sim 104\\%\\) as a more difficult macro backdrop stymied consumption levers (seat expansion, contacts, etc.).

HubSpot does not have a track record of providing specific commentary on the forward revenue outlook at Analyst Day. That said, our analysis suggests that over the past two years, the company has placed initial forward year guidance (given on Q4 results) inline with the Q4 exit rate implied following Q2 results. Specifically, the delta was 50 bps in FY24 and \\(\\sim 110\\) bps in FY25 (Exhibit 6). Following 2Q25 results, Street's implied Q4 growth rate was raised modestly (to \\(\\sim 17\\%\\) from \\(\\sim 16\\%\\) prior) as the company raised FY25 guidance by \\(\\sim \\$ 40M\\) (inclusive of Q2 upside plus favorable FX moves). Assuming an \\(\\sim 80\\) bps delta below this implied Q4 exit (average of the deltas observed on FY24 and FY25 guides) suggests HubSpot could initially guide FY26 to \\(\\sim 16.3\\%\\) , largely inline with current Street estimates at \\(\\sim 16\\%\\) (Exhibit 7).

Given HubSpot's proven ability to execute against interim targets (as evidenced by raising them higher at 2024 Analyst Day), and solid progression to date against these updated interim targets (Exhibit 9), we feel comfortable with further operating margin expansion ahead.
