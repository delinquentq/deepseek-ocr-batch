We identify three reasons for the resilience of USD/JPY versus implied fair value: 1) A narrowing negative USD risk premium; 2) Strong global risk sentiment despite a US economic slowdown; and 3) Speculative JPY short positioning amid low volatility during the summer season. That said, USD/JPY might drop significantly if risk sentiment worsens due to increasing concerns about a US economic slowdown. Worsening risk sentiment, led by concerns about a US economic slowdown, could reverse all three points above. As such, we maintain a short USD/JPY position given its attractive risk/reward. We note that the September 5 US employment report and the subsequent CES preliminary benchmark revision are key to watch.",
