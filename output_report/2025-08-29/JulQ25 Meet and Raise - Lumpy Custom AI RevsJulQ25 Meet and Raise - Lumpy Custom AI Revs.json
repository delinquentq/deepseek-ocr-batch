The 18% decline is disappointing against the backdrop of the strongest Cloud CapEx environment on record,however, we think it's worth considering that 1) MRVL's custom-compute business is nascent with a concentrated customer base, which can be lumpy, and 2) we model that custom IA business to revert back to the trendline in the Jan-26Q. We believe that the company has about 20 custom design wins, which will ramp over the next 1-to-2 years, and the company reiterated its plan to grow its DC share to 20% of a &#36;94bn TAM in CY28. Near-term, we expect the stock to consolidate as investors assess the risk of the near-term custom silicon decline. In the medium turn, we think a P/E ratio of 21 is attractive for an AI chip company with a number of irons in the AI fire. Reiterate Buy.",
