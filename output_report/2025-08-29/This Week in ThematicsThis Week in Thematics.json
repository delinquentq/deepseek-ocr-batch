This week we published a cross- asset piece to provide clear approaches to investing in the nature/ biodiversity theme from an equity and credit perspective. Investors often cite data limitations - whether due to lack of availability, granularity, or complexity - as a key reason for hesitancy in integrating nature into investment decisions. These challenges can obscure the financial materiality of nature- related risks and opportunities, making it harder to assess and compare companies. However, practical solutions already exist to overcome these barriers.",

The UK Government's plan to fast- track the development of new data centres has sparked growing environmental concerns. Critics warn that simplifying the approval process - especially for facilities deemed \"low risk\" - could weaken safeguards and lead to unchecked expansion, particularly on greenbelt land. With nearly 100 new data centres planned, including major AI- focused projects backed by tech giants like Google and Microsoft, experts and campaigners are raising alarms over the massive energy and water demands these facilities require. A recent legal challenge against a 90- megawatt data centre in Buckinghamshire highlights tensions between national ambitions to lead in AI and the need to protect local ecosystems and resources. We continue to flag the need to balance growth with sustainability, ensuring that digital infrastructure development aligns with environmental protection and long- term resilience - Green Data Centers: Beyond Net Zero.",

A widespread data theft campaign has compromised over 700 Salesforce customer organizations, according to Google's Threat Intelligence Group. The attacks, carried out between August 8 and 18, 2025, were linked to a threat actor known as UNC6395, who exploited OAuth tokens from the third- party SalesLoft Drift app to access Salesforce instances. The attackers used automated tools to extract sensitive data, including AWS access keys, VPN credentials, and Snowflake tokens, with a focus on harvesting credentials to infiltrate connected systems.

This initiative allows customers to trade in pre- owned M&S garments, footwear, and accessories via online or in- store processes. As part of M&S's \"Another Life\" sustainability strategy, the program expands its take- back scheme to include accessories, aiming to extend product lifecycles and reduce textile waste. In our view, the resale industry is shifting from a niche sustainability effort to a more mainstream retail model. Along with the focus on technology, the emphasis is also on making secondhand fashion more accessible, efficient, and appealing to a wider audience. Retailers are improving how they collect, sort, and resell items, helping extend the life of clothing and reduce waste, while also meeting growing consumer demand for affordable and sustainable options.",

The UK Government has pledged to introduce new legislation regulating e- scooters following rising safety concerns. The commitment, outlined in the Advanced Manufacturing Sector Plan, aims to end years of legal ambiguity and address the growing use of both rental and private e- scooters, which are currently banned from public roads but widely used illegally. Proposed measures may include mandatory rider testing, insurance requirements, and speed limits for manufacturers. While the move is welcomed for its potential to improve safety and support sustainable transport, campaigners stress the urgency of balancing growth with regulation to protect pedestrians and vulnerable road users. In our view, the micromobility sector has been undergoing a period of readjustment for some time, and the landscape continues to evolve, with operators shifting focus toward profitability while governments reassess regulatory frameworks to better align with safety, sustainability, and urban mobility goals. However, it remains a nuanced space—balancing innovation, public safety, and infrastructure readiness is complex, and policy responses must be tailored to local contexts and usage patterns to ensure long- term viability.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts on companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
