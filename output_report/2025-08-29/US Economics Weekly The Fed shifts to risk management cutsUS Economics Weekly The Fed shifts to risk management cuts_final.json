The threemonth average change in payrolls downshifted to only 35k at the headline and 52k for private payrolls. Prior to this report, most FOMC participants felt risks to the dual mandate were skewed in the direction of inflation persistence, which was a key element in our no-cut outlook this year. However, at Jackson Hole, Chair Powell made it clear that the July employment report increased the committee's concern about weak labor demand. In addition, he noted that growth in real GDP indicated the economy was cooling. Finally, he noted that changes in trade and immigration policies have made it more difficult to distinguish between cyclical and structural effects in labor markets. Since monetary policy can only influence the former, it complicates the Fed's task.",

In a mild recession driven by trade restrictions, we think the Fed could ease to 150- 175% in 2026, though we think the policy rate can stay off the zero lower bound and QE will not be needed. We maintain an upside scenario built around greater fiscal expansion from the OBBBA than we expect and the animal spirits that could come with it. Should this materialize, then demand- side price pressures could mean the Fed eases this year but stays on hold in 2026 as inflation stays elevated (e.g. diminishes only slowly versus our baseline expectation). Our second upside scenario includes both animal spirits and a Fed policy reaction function that exhibits greater tolerance for above- target inflation. In this scenario, growth accelerates in 2026, the unemployment rate falls back toward post- COVID lows and inflation remains near \\(3.0\\%\\) .

In 2026, greater demand from elevated spirits on the back of the OBBBA leads tostronger growth, 2.1%.GDP growth still slows meaningfully in 2025, to 1.4%, from restrictive trade andimmigration policy. In 2026, greater demand from elevated spirits on the back of theOBBBA and lower interest rates leads tostronger growth, 2.3%.Real growth slows to 1.1% (Q4/Q4) in 2025 and 1.3% in 2026. Tariffs act as a tax on consumption and capital, with the weakest quarters for growth in 4Q25 and 1Q26.Real GDP falls 0.3% in 2025 before a 0.9% rebound in 2026. Tariffs, wealth effects, and increased uncertainty hold back capex, hiring, and household spending. The result: mildrecession, a 1.2% peak-to-trough decline in GDP over three quarters beginning Q4 25.Consumer spendingConsumption slows to 1.4% in 2025 then picks up to 1.6% in 2026. Tariffs and immigration policy still weigh on goods spending, but a tighter labor market supports spending in 2026. Limited negative wealth effects on upper income consumers.Consumption slows to 1.4% in 2025 then picks up to 2.0% in 2026. Tariffs and immigration policy still weigh on goods spending, but a tighter labor market supports spending in 2026. Positive wealth effects boost upper income consumers.Consumption slows to 0.7% in 2025 and 0.7% in 2026. Tariffs weigh heavily on goods spending. Limited negative wealth effects on upper income consumers. Less immigration means less employment growth.Consumption falls from Q4 2025 to Q2 2026before a gradual reacceleration. Tariffs weigh heavily on goods spending. Negative wealth effects lead upper-income consumers to pull back, with spillover into broader spending.Nonresidential fixed investmentBusinesses pick up investments more than in the base case on the back of the fiscal bill. Investment rises 4.6% in 2025 and 4.7% in2026.Investment picks up more than in thebaseline both this year and next as tariffs de-escalate and there is more certainty around policy. Investment rises 5.0% in 2025 and4.7% in 2026.Investment picks up to 4.5% in 2025, owing to a strong Q1 that does not reverse, then slows to 2.2% in 2026. Business responds to a slowing economy by delaying expenditures, but does not retrench.A retrenching business sector cutsemployment and capex. Investment declines throughout 2H and into Q1 2026, followed bytepid recovery.Residential investmentStronger income growth and better sentiment helps activity. Still, investment is not as strong as in the de-escalation case since high rates keep the lock-in effect strong: -0.9% in 2025 and +2.0% in 2026.Affordability improves from stronger income growth and sizeable rate cuts. Activity is less weak this year and stronger next: -0.5% in2025 and +3.5% in 2026.Declines by 2.1% in 2025 before a slight pickup to 2.6% in 2026. The combination of slowing income growth and pressures on building from tariffs and immigration weigh on activitybefore rate cuts provide relief.New housing is helped by lower rates, hurt by slower incomes. Existing home sales regain share as low rates lessen mortgage lock-in and raise turnover. Activity is weaker in 2025 then picks up only slightly in 2026.Net tradeTrade is neutral for growth both this year and next. Imports are stronger than in the baseline with stronger demand.Trade is neutral for growth this year and aslight boost next year.Higher trade barriers slow trade volumes, with imports falling most. Export growth slows to 0.3% and 0.6% this year and next, while imports fall 1.8% and 1.3%. Front-loading of imports and a weak consumer drive some of the import weakness. Net trade adds a 0.3pp to growth in 2025 and 0.2pp in 2026.Higher trade barriers slow trade volumesmore drastically. Net trade subtracts 0.1 from growth in 2025 and adds 0.2pp in 2026.Fiscal policyGovernment spending contribution to GDP is same as in baseline, but indirect effects of fiscal policy boost growth more.Government spending contribution to GDP is same as in baseline, but indirect effects of fiscal policy booster growth more.The contribution of fiscal to growth slows from prior years as growth in government spending slows. Still, the fiscal bill boosts 2026 growth by about 0.4pp.The contribution of fiscal to growth slows from prior years as growth in governmentspending slows.

The unemployment rate finishes 2025 at 4.2% and 2026 at 3.6%.Average monthly payroll gains slow to 72k this year and 60k next year. Less immigration means a lower breakeven rate of hiring. The unemployment rate finishes 2025 at 4.4% and 2026 at 4.8%.Payrolls fall an average of 31k per month in 2025 with declines near 200k in Q4. In 2026, payrolls stall, averaging 14k per month. The unemployment rate rises to 4.6% this yearand 5.8% next year.InflationTariffs result in headline and core PCE inflation at 3.0% and 3.2% (Q4/Q4) in 2025, similar to the baseline. In 2026, stronger demand keeps inflation elevated, with headline and core at2.7% and 2.9%.Tariffs result in headline and core PCE inflation at 3.0% and 3.2% (Q4/Q4) in 2025, similar to the baseline.

Contraction slows 2026 inflation relative to the baseline. We expect headline and core PCE at 2.1 and 2.2% in 2026.Federal reserve policyThe Fed cuts 50bp in 2025 and is on hold in 2026 at 3.75-4.0%. Inflation remaining elevated versus our base case, along with growth above potential in 2026, keep them restrictive.The Fed cuts aggressively to 1.75-2.0% in 2026. Monetary policy is set to stimulate activity so long as inflation does not significantly exceed 3.0%.The Fed takes a risk management approach and eases gradually to avoid downside risk to labor market. 50bp of rate cuts in 2025 and 100bp in 2026 for a terminal range of 2.75-3.0%.The Fed shifts to cuts as downside risks to growth mount. 100bp in 2025 and a terminal of 1.50-1.75% in 2026. 275bp in total cuts. No QE.Credit conditionsCredit conditions start to loosen later this year and next on the back of optimism from lower tax rates. High rates keep credit demand weak.Credit conditions begin to loosen later this year and ease further in 2026 on Fed easing. A rebounding housing sector improves credit demand.Credit conditions generally improve with risk- management Fed cuts, though elevated uncertainty restrict the flow of credit to non- prime borrowers.Credit conditions tighten further as the economy contracts. By late next year, the Fed has eased policy enough to encourage some new credit supply but demand remains weak.Productivity growthHigher productivity growth than in the baseline.
