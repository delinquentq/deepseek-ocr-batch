      "text": "Fen Wine reported 2025 Q2 results on 2Q25th. 1H25 sales were Rmb24.0bn, up \\(5.4\\%\\) , and NP was Rmb8.5bn, up \\(1.2\\%\\) . In 2Q25, revenue reached Rmb7.4bn, flattish yoy and largely in line with GSe, and net profit reached Rmb1.9bn, down \\(14\\%\\) yoy and below GSe of Rmb2.1bn. Customer advances were at Rmb5.98bn, \\(+4\\%\\) yoy vs. 2Q24 at Rmb5.73bn, and also improved vs. 1Q25 at Rmb5.82bn. Cash from selling goods was at Rmb7.6bn, down \\(- 6\\%\\) , and calculated sales (adjusted for customer advances balances) were \\(+1\\%\\) yoy in 2Q. Key surprises: 1) Presumably because of an unfavorable mix shift (we believe that the company has released more supply of low- end spirits Bo Fen in 2Q25 under policy impact), Fen Wine's GPM was down - 3.2ppt to \\(71.9\\%\\) and sales tax rate up 2.6ppt, together with selling/admin expense ratio flattish \\(+0.2\\) ppt yoy, leading to NPM contraction of - 4.0ppt yoy to \\(25.0\\%\\) in 2Q25. The selling exp ratio was flattish yoy, likely with the rebate of \"Fenxiangliyu\" to distributors being back- end loaded into 2Q for both 1H25 and 1H24. This scheme has helped to maintain a largely steady wholesale price level for Qinghua 20 this year; 2) The OCF in 2Q25 turned to net outflow of Rmb1.0bn (historical low) vs. a net inflow of Rmb0.9bn in 2Q24. Per Spirits Price References, the wholesale prices of Qinghua 20/30 were at Rmb350/710 currently and Bofen was at Rmb37, both being largely stable in the past two weeks. We think Fen Wine's more resilient topline vs. other upper- mid end spirits in 2Q25 under policy impact is attributable to its more diversified product portfolio especially with strong position in low- end pricing segment with Bo Fen. That said, margin would be under pressure from the mix shift. The stock is trading at 19x/19x 2025E/2026E P/E.",
