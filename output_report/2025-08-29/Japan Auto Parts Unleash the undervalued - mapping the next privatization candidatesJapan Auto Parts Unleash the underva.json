Based on this scoring, we ranked the 67 companies in our auto parts universe by similarity to past take- private cases. As a result, the top- ranked names included Toyota affiliates (Toyota Boshoku, Tokai Rika, Toyoda Gosei, Aisan Industry, Aichi Steel, and Trinity Industrial), Honda/Nissan affiliates (FCC/Nissan Shatai), as well as Seiren. These companies benefit from a stable customer base, which has supported steady profitability. At the same time, their businesses appear relatively mature and may lack significant new growth drivers. With increasing pressure to unwind parent- subsidiary listings, we believe the likelihood of privatizations among such companies could rise.

In August 2025, Toyota Gosei announced the full acquisition of seatbelt supplier Ashimori Industry, which could be seen as part of this broader trend. Furthermore, in our report titled \"The House of Toyota\", we analyzed 16 Toyota- affiliated suppliers that could be potential targets for restructuring under the new holding company of Toyota Fudosan. This analysis was conducted based on three criteria: dependence on Toyota, dependence on ICE, and equity spread, and Toyota Boshoku ranked \\(7\\%\\) among these companies.",

While the company is currently in the midst of a debt restructuring process, after privatization the influence of its former parent Nissan weakened, giving management more freedom to pursue strategies such as roll- up M&A. In 2017, JTEKT made JTEKT Column Systems, then a listed affiliate, a wholly owned subsidiary (Exhibit 9).",

In 2023, by contrast, Honda sold its stake in Yachiyo Industry (fuel tank) through a tender offer by India's Motherson, which subsequently privatized the target company. Similarly, Isuzu responded to a PE fund's tender offer by selling shares in JTT (engine cast parts), marking further privatizations among ICE suppliers (Exhibit 11). In 2025, a string of privatizations has taken place, including SNT (engine forged parts), Toyota Industries, Pacific Industrial (tire valves), and Ashimori Industry (airbags & seatbelts), underscoring rising momentum in privatizations in Japan Autos sector.",

We believe companies that tend to be subject to privatization share several common characteristics. Those with stable earnings can sustain operations without relying heavily on external capital, while companies with limited capex needs are also able to fund investments internally, reducing reliance on public markets. Cash- rich companies similarly have less need for continuous financing. From a shareholder perspective, companies with low shareholder return ratios or those unable to generate returns (ROE) above their cost of equity show limited focus on shareholders, weakening the rationale for remaining listed. Privatization is also more feasible for smaller companies, where the required funding size is lower, and for those trading at low valuations, which may be considered undervalued relative to fundamentals. Finally, companies with controlling shareholders may pursue privatization more readily, particularly against the backdrop of unwinding parent- subsidiary listings and a stronger emphasis on minority shareholder protection.",

Furthermore, in our report titled \"The House of Toyota\", we analyzed 16 Toyota- affiliated suppliers that could be potential targets for restructuring under the new holding company of Toyota Fudosan.

Seiren has a solid earnings base supported by transactions with multiple automakers, relatively high profitability within the auto sector, and operational excellence with an integrated production structure from raw yarn to finished products. While the company does not have a controlling shareholder, its strong financial profile may attract PE funds as a potential take- private candidate.

With over \\(70\\%\\) of sales tied to ICE products, a fundamental transformation of the business will eventually be required amid the long- term xEV transition, and similar to Toyota Industries, Aichi Steel could become a target for restructuring under a Toyota Fudosan- led holding company. In addition, Aichi Steel holds an important position in the Toyota group structure, having been separated from Toyota Industries (not from Toyota Motor), and it is noteworthy that in September 2024 an institutional investor disclosed a stake exceeding \\(5\\%\\) . Furthermore, in our report titled \"The House of Toyota\", we analyzed 16 Toyota- affiliated suppliers that could be potential targets for restructuring under the new holding company of Toyota Fudosan.
