ROA/ROE fell -3bp/-43bp y-y to 0.59%/10.2% in 2Q25. ABC declared an interim DPS of RMB0.1195 for 1H25 (up +2.7% y-y), with unchanged payout ratio at 30%.

Dealing gain was mixed, +2.9% q-q / - 22% y-y in 2Q25 to account for 7.9% of total operating income (- 2.35ppt y-y) mainly due to high base of 2Q24. Asset quality: 2Q25 NPL ratio was flat q-q 1.28% in 2Q25, mainly due to opposing asset quality trend in corporate vs. retail loan book; with lower corporate NPL ratio of 1.45% in 1H25 (- 13bp h-h driven by construction / manufacturing / retail and wholesale sector NPL ratio reduction by - 35bp/- 27bp/- 25bp h-h in 1H25), help offsetting the negative from retail NPL ratio increase by +14bp h-h to 1.18% in 1H25 (w/ higher NPL ratio observed mainly in mortgage/credit card loan book, +4bp/+5bp h-h to 0.77%/1.51% in 1H25). However, after adding back write offs, gross NPL formation rate edged up slightly to 0.57% in 2Q25 (+2bp y-y). Meanwhile, we note mixed asset quality trend with SML ratio decline by - 1bp h-h to 1.39% in 1H25, while overdue >3month loan ratio edged up +4bp h-h to 0.82% in 1H25. Despite mixed asset quality trend, ABC charged a lower credit cost of 62bp in 2Q25 (- 28bp q-q / - 13bp y-y), which brought down NPL coverage ratio modestly by - 2.81ppt q-q to 295.0% in 2Q25. CIR increased by +0.75ppt y-y to 32.6% due to both revenue weakness (+1.1% y-y only in 2Q25) and increased OPEX (+3.5% y-y in 2Q). CET- 1/tier- 1/total CAR were down - 12bp / - 32bp / - 34bp q-q to 11.11%/13.04%/17.45% in 2Q25 likely due to FY24 dividend payout.",

With high expectation on ABC, we think market would react negatively to ABC's muted 2Q25 PPOP growth (flat y- y, ranking the lowest among Big6 banks), while its 2Q25 NPAT growth of 3.2% y- y is also below expectation, falling behind that of PSBC's earnings growth of +4.8% y- y in 2Q25. Despite ABC is not facing equity dilution risk in 2025E, given the bank is in the second batch of Big6 banks recapitalization, we note that after significant re- rating, ABC- A/ABC- H's dividend yield of 3.3%/4.7% no longer looks attractive vs. Big6 bank peers. Factoring in potential equity dilution from recapitalization in 2026E (c.11.4% on our estimate), ABC- A/- H 26E dividend yield would be even lower at 3.0%/4.3%.",

ABC underwent its first recapitalization and NPL carve- out in 1998- 99. On October 21, 2008, the State Council approved ABC's joint stock reform implementation. Subsequently, ABC completed a number of financial restructurings, before it was formally converted into a joint stock limited company from a state- owned commercial bank on January 15, 2009. ABC was listed in HK on 16th July 2010. ABC is the third largest bank in China by total assets, but the largest in terms of number of branches and retail customers.

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities.

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.
