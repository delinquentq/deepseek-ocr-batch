China eCommerce Customer Management Revenue growth of +10% yoy came largely in- line while group adj. EBITA of Rmb39bn (- 14% yoy) came 3% ahead of GSe (yet 9% below consensus) on the back of in- line China eCommerce EBITA and significantly narrower International commerce (AIDC) losses. We note the initial positive share price reaction (+4% pre- market vs. KWEB flat) can likely be attributed to the acceleration in cloud growth (AI revenue remained at triple- digits yoy) and capex beat (higher qoq vs. peers that were mostly lower qoq due to foreign chip bans), alongside better- than- feared food delivery/Instant commerce investment drag to the June- quarter results (yet we note the investment intensity has further stepped since July).",
