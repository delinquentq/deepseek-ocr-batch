What we think was perhaps less contemplated by the market was the degree to which the JD Blackberry launch would also influence shipment timing. Ultimately, the two factors translated to a 6- point shipment tailwind to the US in the first quarter. Stripping this away, depletions- based US OSG of \\(- 8\\%\\) lagged our - MSD expectation for the quarter; however, we'd note there was evidently some RTM- transition- related noise on depletion- based results as well, with instances of takeaways ahead of depletions in certain markets. To be sure, the underlying US performance represents a soft start to the year, but we're interested to see what the increased focus and dedicated salesforce tied to the the RTM changes, along with the JD Blackberry innovation, can do for domestic trends looking ahead. And importantly, the FY26 guide assumes a largely steady consumer environment through the balance of the year.",

And indeed, this seems to be the case internally (if not yet by the investment community), given CEO Lawson Whiting's comments during yesterday's conference call that the business is allocating more resources to emerging markets. Healthy levels of support behind these markets are all the more crucial at a time when US and developed international growth remains challenged, and Mr. Whiting acknowledged the difficulty in forecasting the recovery for those markets (e.g. while the view is that there is still growth to be had, he refrained from opining specifically on if/when the US spirits industry returns to \\(+4 - 5\\%\\) growth).",

BFB will also continue to support Mexico, where the macro backdrop remains challenged, but BFB is gaining share within the RTD and whiskey categories.

From a geographic perspective, we still look for +MSD growth from emerging markets over the balance of the year, but flowing through the F1Q beat brings the full year to +9.9% (from +5.6%). In contrast, we now look for developed international organic sales to decline - 3.9% (from - 3.4%).

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
