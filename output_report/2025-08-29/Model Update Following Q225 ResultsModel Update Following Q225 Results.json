Some of the biggest considerations relate to the potential timing and impact of generic competition on Xifaxan, litigation, various considerations related to B&L, FCF, other operating trends including Solta performance, the potential contribution of Red- C (if approved) / other launches, future liability management, potential impacts from tariffs/transfer pricing, and other. BHCCN made significant progress on upcoming maturities with its Q225 refinancing, but we note there is more to go (roughly \\(4.3 billion in 2028). We believe pipeline products could prove to be an important part to the story in the out years. We rate BHCCN's bonds Buy but we appreciate the uncertainties and potential volatility in the story. If BHCCN hits our 2025 estimates (consolidated), EBITDA would be\\) 3,472 mn, and this would put consolidated net leverage at 5.6x. BHCCN's guidance for consolidated 2025 EBITDA is \\(3,485 - 3,635 mn\\).",

By our calculations this put consolidated net leverage at \\(6.0x\\) and this down from \\(6.2x\\) for LTM 3/31/25. Due to certain accounting adjustments (as part of the Q322 exchanges), certain debt balances per the balance sheet incorporate additional items. As such, the debt balance per the balance sheet is higher than the principal balances. By our calculations per BHCCN's Q225 slides, the accounting changes added roughly \\(588 mm to the debt balances at 6/30/25, which had roughly a 0.2x impact on consolidated PF leverage. Based on this math, net leverage would be roughly 5.8x - which is 6.0x less 0.2x - using principal debt balances.",

It's our belief that, if approved, in most cases Red- C would be prescribed by the same doctor that prescribes Xifaxan. BHCCN continues to expect a phase 3 read- out on Red- C in early 2026.

They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have shorter- term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer- term ratings. Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/), and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high- conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near- term or medium- term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12- month view of total return or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate.

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
