The BOJ's version of core- core CPI inflation (all items, less energy and fresh food) came to \\(+3.0\\%\\) , slowing from \\(+3.1\\%\\) in the previous month. Inflation for all items excluding energy and food (but including alcoholic beverages) came to \\(+1.5\\%\\) , down from \\(+1.7\\%\\) in the previous month.
