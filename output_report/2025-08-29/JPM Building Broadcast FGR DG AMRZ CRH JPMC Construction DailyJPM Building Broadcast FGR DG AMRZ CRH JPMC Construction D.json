Amrize has received a notice of an unsolicited \"mini-tender\" offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation to purchase up to 2,000,000 ordinary shares of Amrize at a price of \\(49.63\\). The offer represents less than \\(1.0\\%\\) of the outstanding Ordinary Shares. TRC's offer price is \\(4.48\\%\\) less than the \\(51.96\\) closing price on August 26, 2025, the last trading day before the mini-tender offer commenced. Amrize does not endorse TRC's unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommends that Amrize shareholders do not tender their Ordinary Shares in the offer because the offer is at a price below the current market price for the Ordinary Shares. TRC has included in the terms of its offer a condition that the closing price of the Ordinary Shares must not decrease by more than \\(5\\%\\) from the closing price on August 26, 2025. As a result, unless TRC decides to waive this condition, Amrize shareholders who tender their Ordinary Shares in the offer would receive a below-market price for Amrize's Ordinary Shares through the tender offer. The offer is also subject to numerous other conditions. Link to the press release.",

Fiscal outcomes overall would be in line with the team's deficit forecast (5.3% next year, 5.5% this year; consensus is similar), so the fiscal consolidation would be significantly less than assumed by the Bayrou government. If the new PM option is politically unstable, Macron could call a snap election. The most likely outcome would be a relative majority RN government.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months.
