      "text": "Caution into the next few months for the CJS channel: Experts expressed caution on the immediate outlook for the CJS channel, particularly in light of recent funding volatility. The Director noted the abrupt withdrawal of Biden's federal funding for long- acting buprenorphine injectables (LAIBs) in 4Q24, halting Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) purchases of Brixadi and Sublocade. Recovery has been limited, with facilities reliant on State Opioid Response grants (settlement cash), which are difficult to access. While FBOP has stalled, state Departments of Corrections (DOCs) and county jails show signs of recovery. Some DOCs are renegotiating contracts and reversing penny- per- pill policies due to diversion issues. County jails use workaround funding streams (e.g., digital device rentals) to maintain LAIB access. The Commissioner noted that while Medication- Assisted Treatment (MAT) remains a priority, CJS may face a slog securing new funding. Experts expect a flat to modestly improving 3Q, with no major inflections unless federal support resumes. We note that the Commissioner, however, was incrementally more positive than the Director.",

In 5 years, he expects a shift to \\(60\\%\\) pill, \\(20\\%\\) film, and \\(20\\%\\) injectable, largely driven by lower diversion risk and better re- entry outcomes.

Unlike Sublocade, which forms a visible, globular depot under the skin and uses a larger gauge needle, Brixadi leaves little physical trace. Weekly/monthly dosing options also allow facilities to align Treatment to sentence length and re- entry timelines. The commissioner also noted that Brixadi's 30- day duration is particularly valuable for bridging patients into the community, where the first 2 wks post- release are the highest risk for overdose. These factors make it a more practical and scalable choice for MAT. The Director expects the CJS split between Brixadi/Sublocade to shift to 70/30 within 5 years, from 60/40 currently.",

      "text": "Contracting dynamics in the CJS: Contracting within the CJS is complex, fragmented, and varies by jurisdiction. At the state level, contracts are typically structured as 3- 5 year agreements, often with two one- year extension options. These contracts are awarded through standard procurement processes, involving competitive bidding, scoring by selection committees, and formal handover. Once awarded, contracts are rarely overturned mid- cycle, making initial access critical. Contract values vary significantly by state size and scope. Larger states like California may see contract sizes in the hundreds of millions, while smaller states like Vermont operate in the low double- digit million range. Most states do not receive preferred pricing and must absorb the full cost of LAIBs, with any discounts at the discretion of the manufacturer. Manufacturers aiming to win or retain contracts must demonstrate not only pricing competitiveness but also operational support, such as helping states identify external funding streams (e.g., SOR grants) and offering scalable solutions tailored to correctional workflows. The Commissioner emphasised that legislative advocacy and targeting states with robust MAT programmes are key to unlocking budgetary support and long- term adoption. Specifically, he flagged the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA), a national body comprising state and federal correctional directors. Manufacturers of OUD drugs often engage the CLA to influence contracting decisions across state and federal prisons.",

Reliance on partners - Camurus is partnered with Braeburn in the US for CAM2038, and so it has limited direct control on performance in this key market; clinical failures for pipeline assets will likely impact sentiment despite our view that limited value is ascribed to these in the share price. Competition with other LAI technologies - There are several novel injectable drug technologies in development. If any of these technologies show material benefits compared with Camurus's fluid crystal technology, they could impact long- term performance.
