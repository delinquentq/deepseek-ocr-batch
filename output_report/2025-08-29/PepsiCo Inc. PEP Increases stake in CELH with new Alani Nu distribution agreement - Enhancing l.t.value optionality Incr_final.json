      "text": "Our View - PEP & CELH (Not Covered) this morning announced an agreement to strengthen their long- term strategic partnership in which Celsius Holdings' Alani Nu brand will transition into PEP's distribution network in the US and Canada. As part of the deal, CELH also acquires the Rockstar Energy brand in the US and Canada from PEP - which doesn't come as much of a surprise considering some of the long standing headwinds the brand has faced under PEP's ownership, though Rockstar could help attract incremental consumers to CELH's portfolio who prefer classic energy drink flavors and formats. Overall, we view this as a key strategic positive as it allows PEP to further participate in the fast- growing energy drink market in a more meaningful way - especially considering Alani Nu is the fastest growing brand in modern energy drinks (per CELH mgmt). The agreement (effective today) transitions distribution away from existing Alani Nu distribution partners such as ABI to PEP (in the US and Canada) and includes the all- important retail and food service channels (as well as other growth channels). With this deal, PEP acquired \\(\\) 585M\\(in newly issued convertible 5% preferred stock (while extending its existing preferred stock to the same conversion period) - increasing PEP's ownership stake in CELH to\\) \\sim 11\\% \\(on an as- converted basis. Importantly, we not only believe this insulates PEP's downside risk, but also provides upside optionality as it allows PEP to participate more directly given the rejection to convert the preferred stock to common stock at\\) \\ \\(15.75\\) /share (a \\(\\sim 13\\%\\) discount to CELH's last closing price of \\(\\) 59.69\\(on 8/28). Further, we note that the preferred stock automatically converts to common stock at the end of a 6- year period. \\) \\text {B} \\text {r} \\text {a} \\text {l} \\text {y}, \\text {t} \\text {h}
