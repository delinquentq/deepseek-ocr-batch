Political factors appear to be the main drivers of such price action, namely, corruption allegations involving President Milei's inner circle, coupled with concerns about the Lower Chamber's decision on whether to overturn President Milei's vetoes on laws that would have materially increased fiscal spending. Notably, only the veto related to the disability emergency law, which has a cost of \\(\\sim 0.3\\%\\) of GDP, could be overturned if the Senate eventually decides to do so (and even then there are avenues to delay implementation; see D. Pereira), whereas the more substantial \\(1.2\\%\\) of GDP pensions law veto was sustained, an outcome which we view positively, all things considered.",

This has been achieved primarily by increasing reserve requirements and conducting repo operations, while also intervening in the FX derivatives market (Figure 2). Wednesday's Treasury auction achieved a \\(115\\%\\) rollover of maturing debt, and yesterday's new regulation on banks' net position in foreign currency further supports this strategy.",

In Figure 7 we construct interpolated LECAPs and BONCAPs yields for 1m, 3m, 6m, 9m, and 12m tenors, and compare them with NDF yields. FX-hedged returns look appealing as NDF yields have lagged the move higher in domestic instruments' yields. This is a lower risk alternative ahead of elections, allowing investors to capture a spread between two similar ARS-denominated instruments without incurring FX risk. We note these are still two distinct markets, each with its own set of participants and unique liquidity conditions. As a result, spreads can develop and persist throughout the duration of the trade. The onshore nature of LECAPs and BONCAPs makes them more susceptible to changes in domestic regulation as well.",
