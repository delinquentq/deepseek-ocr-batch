We obtain our target price of \\(\\) 3,200\\(by multiplying our 27 / 3 EPS forecast of\\) \\ \\(228\\) by a P/E of around 14x. We apply a discount of around \\(20\\%\\) (previously around \\(10\\%\\) ) to the benchmark average P/E. We now factor in expectations for a major project to make a large contribution to earnings in 27/3. While we are focusing on the potential of new businesses, such as the ELERA global retail platform, we retain our Neutral rating, as we think the company's overall growth potential is limited given the high weighting of existing businesses.",
