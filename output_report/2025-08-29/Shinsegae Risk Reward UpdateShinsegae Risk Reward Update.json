Without any meaningful change in SSSG (department store) or ICN rent scheme (TR), we do not expect any substantial improvement in margins of these divisions. Thus, we have cut our EPS estimates by \\(7.9\\%\\) for 2025e, \\(7.5\\%\\) for 2026e and \\(6.7\\%\\) for 2027e. Accordingly, our price target has changed to W175,000 from W180,000 (down \\(3\\%\\) ), which is derived from a multi- stage residual income model (unchanged).",
