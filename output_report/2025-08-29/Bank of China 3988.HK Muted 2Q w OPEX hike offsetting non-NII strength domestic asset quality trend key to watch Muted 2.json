Meanwhile, retail loan growth was slower, +0.7% h-h in 1H25, due to credit card loan book shrinkage -13.9% h-h in 1H25). As decent loan growth in 2Q25 (+1.8% q-q) outpaced deposit growth (+0.1% q-q in 2Q), LDR increased +1.45ppt q-q to 89.7% in 2Q25. Fee income accelerated to +19.2% y-y in 2Q25 (vs. +2.1% y-y in 1Q), likely thanks to decent agency fee/custodian fee income growth of +23.7%/+11.0% y-y in 1H25. Dealing gains were solid, +6.7% q-q/+77.9% y-y in 2Q25 to account for 10.4% of total revenue (+0.7ppt q-q/+4.3ppt y-y), thanks to more favorable bond market condition in 2Q25. Other income was up, +23.6% q-q/+23.8% y-y in 2Q25, likely thanks to strong precious metals sales income (+36.9% y-y in 1H25). CET-1/ Tier1/ Total CAR were up +75bp/+52bp/+69bp q-q to 12.57%/14.32%/18.67% in 2Q25 thanks to RMB165mn equity recapitalization in 2Q25, which help boosted CET1 ratio by 81bp based on 2Q25 RWA.

Asset quality: while Group overall NPL ratio was decent at 1.24% in 2Q25 (down - 1bp q-q), we note that it was mainly driven by lower NPL ratio overseas (down - 11bp h-h to 1.62% in 1H25), while mainland NPL ratio remains mixed with NPL ratio up +1bp h-h to 1.18% in 1H25. By sector, mainland retail loan book saw sizable NPL ratio increase by +18bp h-h to reach 1.15% in 1H25, due to across-the-board NPL ratio increase in mortgage/credit card/other retail loan book, up +13bp/+20bp/+29bp h-h to 0.74%/1.93%/2.01% in 1H25; this has offset the positive from lower corporate NPL ratio, down - 7bp h-h to 1.19% in 1H25 (driven by NPL ratio decline across the sectors, except for property sector, which still saw +44bp h-h NPL ratio increase to 5.38% in 1H25). Against domestic asset quality pressure, BOC notably accelerated NPL digestion in 2Q25, with write-off amount up +36.6% q-q/28% y-y to RMB20.1bn in 2Q25 per our estimate. Adding back write-offs, gross NPL formation rate was up +6bp y-y to 0.42% in 2Q25. While SML ratio showed improving trend, - 3bp h-h to 1.44% in 1H, overdue >3m ratio deteriorated by +3bp h-h to 0.86% in 1H25. Meanwhile, BOC appears to have relaxed NPL recognition standard in 1H25, seen in the - 6.2ppt h-h decline in NPL to overdue >3m ratio to 144.6% in 1H25. BOC charged a modestly reduced credit cost of 43bp in 2Q25 (- 16bp q-q/- 6bp y-y), bringing its NPL coverage ratio down by - 0.58ppt q-q to 197.4% in 2Q25. CIR was up +1.99ppt y-y to 36.4% in 2Q25, mainly due to surprise OPEX hike +10.9% y-y, offsetting the positive from decent revenue growth of +4.9% y-y in 2Q.

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon.

For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR.

Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management.

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share- price movement will not materialize as expected.",
