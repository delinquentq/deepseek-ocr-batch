In our view, this is not a signal of strong underlying demand, as it was boosted by low deflators, export frontloading, and its composition appears at odds with other high frequency data and demand signals.- Growth data appear mixed so far in Q3, but real GDP will get another boost from a low deflator, export frontloading (until August) and base effects, keeping it at an elevated \\(7.4\\%\\) y-o-y. We expect the impact of higher tariffs to be visible after September, leading to a sharper slowdown to \\(6.0\\%\\) in Q4 and \\(5.6\\%\\) in Q1 2026.- Our view on the economic cycle remains unchanged, but given the higher Q2 GDP, we are statistically revising our FY26 GDP growth forecast to \\(6.6\\%\\) (from \\(6.0\\%\\) ). This implies average growth of \\(5.8\\%\\) y-o-y in H2 FY26 versus \\(7.6\\%\\) in H1 FY26.- The upside surprise in Q2 GDP, and with the RBI's FY26 GDP growth forecast of \\(6.5\\%\\) looking realistic, markets have responded by questioning whether policy support is needed. In our view, high headline growth prints should not lead to policy complacency, given the drivers behind the rise, and the incoming growth shocks.- We believe a multi-pronged policy response is needed to support exporters and boost domestic demand: targeted fiscal/credit support, reform stimulus, diversifying India's export markets and monetary policy. We expect the RBI's MPC to be forward-looking, especially given the lags in policy transmission, and retain our forecast of 25bp cuts each in October and December, taking the terminal rate to \\(5.00\\%\\) by end-2025.",

Higher growth in private consumption (where low food inflation plays a bigger role) was likely boosted due to this. Similarly, the pick- ups in export growth and import growth are not mirrored in the nominal trends. In fact, across many sectors, real growth accelerated even as nominal growth fell, reflecting the role of low deflators in boosting real growth.",

Rural consumption indicators (tractor and two- wheeler sales) are holding up, but urban consumption appears soft (passenger vehicle and diesel sales). Within the industrial sector, utilities are trailing, in part owing to monsoons, but infrastructure and construction output are holding up, likely due to public capex. Merchandise export growth should continue to be stronger into August, ahead of the implementation of the \\(25\\%\\) penalty, but a slowdown is likely after September. Meanwhile, the coming GST rationalisation and expectations of lower prices will likely lead to lower consumer goods demand in August- September in the run- up to its implementation. Nevertheless, with the GDP deflator likely to moderate further in Q3, the disconnect between real GDP and high frequency data is likely to continue.

While GST implementation will lead to some surge in demand in October/November, the fundamental drivers of consumption - jobs and income prospects - suggest soft discretionary demand (see India: Macro effects of a GST rate cut; theory versus practice, 19 August 2025).",
