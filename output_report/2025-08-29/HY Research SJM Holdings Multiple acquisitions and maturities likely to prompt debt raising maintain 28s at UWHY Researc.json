While the transaction supports long- term consolidation, multiple acquisitions and staggered maturities may prompt further debt raising, especially amid weak earnings and potential renovation disruptions in its properties in Macau Peninsula. We estimate these announced acquisitions (including satellite casinos and the Hengqin hotel) and maturities could reach USD1.1- 1.3bn (Figure 1), versus its existing liquidity of USD825mn. Although management reiterated strong bank support and no plans to raise equity on the 2Q25 earnings call, we believe bond issuance remains a viable option if HIBOR- financing cost rises or longer- tenor bonds become reasonably priced.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
