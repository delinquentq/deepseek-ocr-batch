FY26 is also going to be very mixed,with a very weak Q1, continued cost control (albeit offset by the hit from tariffs), a further improvement in FCF conversion but dilution from disposals. But the critical question is: what takes Pernod to +3% to +6% top-line. Underlying trends in India remain strong and will improve with the disposal of Imperial Blue. The drag from wine will drop out. Share trends in the US are moving in the right direction (albeit not quite +ve yet) and are in +ve territory in many markets. However, a recovery in underlying market growth in the USA and China is critical. In both markets, we believe the worm will ultimately turn. But there is no sign yet. And it will likely be the Festive Season in the USA and the build up to New Year in China before there are definitive indications.",
