The company now expects turnkey revenue to achieve significant double- digit growth \\((>20\\%)\\) in 2025, while NRE is projected to grow at a low single- digit rate, with some projects pushed to 2026. Despite the lower NRE contribution, the 2025 revenue expectation is more optimistic than earlier in the year, mainly due to stronger- than- expected crypto performance. For 3Q, management maintains guidance for double- digit QoQ revenue growth, with turnkey up \\(20 + \\%\\) QoQ but NRE declining by double digits sequentially.",

While the company continues to attempt to move up from TK3 to TK2 or TK1 levels of engagement with CSPs, so far progress has been limited.

We believe that GUC has a small engagement with this social media focused US CSP on its 3nm AI ASIC, but this is likely to be only project focused NRE with no real turnkey engagement. For larger project with turnkey revenues from this customer, we believe Broadcom, Marvell, or MediaTek would be more likely candidates rather than pure design service vendors, given the stage of front- end design expertise for this CSP customer and the complexity of the project.",
