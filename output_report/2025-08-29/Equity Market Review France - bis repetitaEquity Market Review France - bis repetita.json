      "text": "(see Mounting risks, 25 Aug), as he lacks a parliamentary majority, and both the far right (RN) and the left- wing (NFP) have confirmed they will vote against him. If that were to be the case, we see three potential scenarios: 1) the most probable one is for President Macron to appoint a new PM, as he did with Bayrou after Barnier's government collapsed in December, but this time around from his own camp. The new PM would be tasked with drafting the budget, which may take some time and result in less fiscal tightening; 2) Macron dissolves the national assembly and calls new elections, as he did in June last year. We think this is unlikely, given the strong showing of RN in the polls, although not impossible and increasingly part of the debate; 3) Macron resigns and triggers an early Presidential election, which we see as the least likely. We had warned investors about rising political/fiscal risk in France (see Germany vs. France divide, 30 Jun), and indeed Bayrou's decision took markets off guard this week. But complacency has quickly gone: the OAT- Bund spread is hovering near 80bp, up from 65bp a few days ago, French CDS are close to June'24 snap election highs, CAC is down \\(\\sim 3\\%\\) , our French domestic basket (BCEUFROD) down \\(\\sim 7\\%\\) , and MSCI France P/E relative is close to the lows again. If the first scenario materialises, we think risk premia are most likely to come down from here, with the OAT- Bund spread getting \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or to 70bp, and a small rebound in equities. If Macron were to call a new election, the spread would likely get near 90bp again, which may result in 2- 3% additional downside for the breakeven index and more for domestics. The most disruptive scenario would likely be Macron to step down, taking the spread close to 100bp and domestic stocks down double digits. Overall, we think the first scenario is the most likely, so would be buying the dip. But no need to rush, and we expect a bumpy ride ahead, with a tricky path into the 2027 presidential election likely to keep French risk premia elevated. So we think investors could consider hedging political risk in domestic sectors like banks with exporters like Luxury) and could consider French exporters, in CAC, vs domestic names.",

      "text": "US leadership reinforced, but don't write- off Europe just yet. After tariff- driven headwinds, domestic political noise is resurfacing in Europe. Alongside the French drama, the Dutch government narrowly survived a similar motion this week. In Germany, tensions within the ruling CDU/CSU- SPD coalition are reportedly rising, with speculation about a potential split and the formation of a minority government. Meanwhile, in the US, Big Tech continues to deliver strong fundamentals, and Nvidia's results underscored robust AI capex spending (see Networking Shines as China Remains Unresolved, 27 Aug). Non- tech US equities have also benefited from the Fed put following Jackson Hole, contributing to a broadening of the rally into laggards and renewed US outperformance vs. Europe. Arguably, with US relative valuation back to the highs and positioning more extended too (see Who Owns What Fed put unleashed, 27 Aug), it may not be all smooth sailing in the US. Concerns over the Fed independence may play with FX and rate market nerves, and while our economists maintain that a September rate cut is the base case, strong payrolls and/or sticky inflation may still shift the Fed's reaction function, with a lot of dovishness in the price now. So we think diversification through Europe has merits, as its relative valuations are back near historical lows, even as activity remains resilient and political noise seems manageable.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
