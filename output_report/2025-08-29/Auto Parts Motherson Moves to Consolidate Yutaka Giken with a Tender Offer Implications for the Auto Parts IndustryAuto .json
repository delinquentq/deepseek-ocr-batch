      "text": "Samvardhana Motherson announced on Aug 29 that it will launch a tender offer bid with a view to making Yutaka Giken a consolidated subsidiary upon delisting. It aims to start the tender offer, assuming approval of the relevant national authorities, in late Jan 2026, at a price of \\(\\) 3,024\\$ / share. Motherson says that via a series of transactions, including the tender offer, it plans to consolidate Yutaka with an \\(81\\%\\) share in voting rights and the remaining \\(19\\%\\) held by Honda. Yutaka is an auto parts maker in which Honda currently owns \\(69.66\\%\\) of shares, whose products include primers, torque converters, brake disks and motorcycle components. In F3/25 its sales were \\(\\) 179.2bn\\$ and OP was \\(\\) 6.3bn\\$ . Other moves by Motherson, a leading Indian auto parts company, to strengthen ties with Japanese companies have included acquisition of mirrors business from Ichikoh in 2023 and consolidation of then- Honda affiliate Yachiyo Industry (sunroofs, fuel tanks, etc) in 2024. In terms of implications for the auto parts industry, we expect moves such as seeking greater efficiency and speeding up development via alliances with other companies to gain in importance as firms need to address issues including responses to receding demand in mature fields such as ICE parts, and development investment in advanced areas for BEVs/SDVs.",
