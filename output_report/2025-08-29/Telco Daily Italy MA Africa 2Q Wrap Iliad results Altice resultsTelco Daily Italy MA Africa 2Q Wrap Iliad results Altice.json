Reynaud stated that no talks have taken place since early April and none are expected to resume. He emphasized that consolidation prospects with Telecom Italia are now considered closed, and the prevailing assumption is a continuation of a four- operator market in Italy. We do not believe this means consolidation will not eventually happen in Italy but clearly it is unlikely in the short term. As shown in Fig 1, no player is earning its cost of capital in Italy with an average ROCE of \\(1.2\\%\\) Whilst competition has slightly abated, we do not see for most players a path to earn an attractive return. Consolidation would create material value for all players. There are other potential combinations besides Iliad/TI and also the ability to consider infrastructure deals,",

Data usage continues to grow across the markets, and with growing smartphone penetration we see stronger demand in coming years. In 1H25, MTN reported \\(+22.4\\%\\) yoy service revenue growth (organic, constant FX) (1H24: \\(+12.1\\%\\) ), while Airtel Africa revenue grew \\(+24.9\\%\\) yoy in 1Q26 (4Q25: \\(23.2\\%\\) ). Vodacom posted \\(+13.8\\%\\) in 1Q26 (4Q25: \\(+13.5\\%\\) ). South Africa's competitive landscape is challenging, and we expect service revenue growth to remain modest for the remainder of the year. In contrast, Nigeria's recent price increases have been well received, and we expect this to support stronger revenue growth in the second half. Mobile money continues to be a key growth engine for both MTN and Airtel Africa. Despite some delays in monetization, the segment is showing healthy expansion, partly driven by rising smartphone adoption. With ongoing investments in distribution and fintech use cases, we are positive on the outlook for mobile money through the rest of the year.",

Management however flagged that Iliad had balance sheet flexibility for any potential deal, either for geographic expansion or consolidation. On that note, as for other French operators, Iliad's management confirmed that discussions about consolidation in France had taken place, although they were \"very preliminary discussions\" and a deal would be complex. As we discussed in French consolidation: Third time lucky? - 20 May 2025, in light of heightened competition and persistently low ROCEs in France, we see substantial potential for value creation through consolidation. During the results conference call, management also discussed operating trends, notably in France and Italy. Results showed a continued slowdown in France with service revenues up only \\(+0.9\\%\\) yoy \\((+4\\%)\\) in 1Q25) as volume growth stalled (no Mobile/Broadband growth) but management is confident it can continue to grow revenues and expects 2H to remain in positive territory. In Italy, service revenue growth remains solid at \\(+9.4\\%\\) yoy (in line with 1Q25). Mobile volumes remained steady with \\(+287k\\) mobile net adds (vs \\(+218k\\) in 4Q25) and 32k Broadband net adds (vs \\(+40k\\) in 1Q25). Management also expects to continue to grow and does not see a need to change its strategy. Source: Company (28 August 2025)",

Barclays Israeli branch previously held an investment marketing license with the Israel Securities Authority but it cancelled such license on 30/11/2014 as it solely provides its services to eligible clients pursuant to available exemptions under the Advisory Law, therefore a license with the Israel Securities Authority is not required.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
