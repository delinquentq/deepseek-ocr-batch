One reasonable interpretation of this is that valuations were not effective because of the uncertain earnings outlook. Since July, however, B/P (the inverse of P/B), a stock value factor, has been performing well.",

This shows that next- FY forecast E/P factor returns were inferior in the first half of 2025, and this trend worsened immediately after the tariff shock of 2 April. This may have been due to investors taking the view that there was greater uncertainty about earnings in subsequent years than in the current fiscal year. However, this gap narrowed as 25/3 Q4 results were released, and the gap between the two has been widening recently, with next- FY forecast E/P as at advantage since July.",

Our analysis shows that when the revision index bottomed out and then improved substantially into positive territory in 2016 H2 and 2020 H2 (Figure 3), the next- FY forecast E/P factor tended to become more effective. When the revision index can be expected to improve sharply (implying a steeper improvement in future earnings), optimism about the earnings outlook apparently prevails, and interest in future earnings tends to increase. In other words, we should expect this factor return spread to continue to widen. Figure 4 shows stocks with a substantial gap between next- FY forecast E/P and current- FY E/P, and that appear undervalued based on next- FY forecast E/P.",
