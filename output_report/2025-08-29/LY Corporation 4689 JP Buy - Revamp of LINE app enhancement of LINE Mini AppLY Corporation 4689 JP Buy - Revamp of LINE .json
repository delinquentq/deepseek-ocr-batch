We think a boost to sales from the planned revamp of the LINE app and the addition of payment functionality to the LINE Mini app would be a catalyst for a rally in the share price.",

LINE Mini App is a web application that runs on LINE and allows stores and companies to create mini apps through which they can provide their services on LINE. The number of mini apps developed on LINE Mini App stood at 25,000 at end- July 2025, equivalent to only \\(9\\%\\) of the 282,000 official paying LINE accounts. The number of monthly mini app users is 14mn, which on a per- mini app basis comes to a low number of users, indicating low awareness. The company thus plans to provide support for customers' businesses by adding all commerce business billing functions to the LINE Mini App by around end- 26/3. As a result, the company aims to generate fee revenues. The company also plans to add booking and product purchase functionality to the mini apps, and we expect growth in account advertising revenues from an increase in the number of messages sent to customers. On 29 August, the company announced the introduction of digital content billing functionality for LINE Mini App, but this is only part of the payment functionality.",

Inflation- indexed JGBs carry the risk of losses, as prices fluctuate in line with changes in market interest rates and fluctuations in the nationwide consumer price index. The notional principal of inflation- indexed JGBs changes in line with the rate of change in nationwide CPI inflation from the time of its issuance. The amount of the coupon payment is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate by the notional principal at the time of payment. The maturity value is the amount of the notional principal when the issue becomes due. For J117 and subsequent issues, the maturity value shall not undercut the face amount. Purchases of investment trusts (and sales of some investment trusts) are subject to a purchase or sales fee of up to \\(5.5\\%\\) (tax included) of the transaction amount. Also, a direct cost that may be incurred when selling investment trusts is a fee of up to \\(2.0\\%\\) of the unit price at the time of redemption. Indirect costs that may be incurred during the course of holding investment trusts include, for domestic investment trusts, an asset management fee (trust fee) of up to \\(5.5\\%\\) (tax included/annualized basis) of the net assets in trust, as well as fees based on investment performance. Other indirect costs may also be incurred. For foreign investment trusts, indirect fees may be incurred during the course of holding such as investment company compensation.",
