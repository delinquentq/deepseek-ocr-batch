Group value is dependent on cash flows derived from its interest in the RKEF lines located in the IMIP controlled by major shareholder Tsingshan, as well as HPALs and adverse conditions could have a significant impact on group earnings. Key downside risks include: The company is exposed to macroeconomic developments affecting the nickel price and exchange rates, operational risks that might affect volumes and input costs, and political risks that might affect costs and the company's reputation. The fiscal regime has precedent for changing which could also impact NIC, as could the timing around VAT refund payments. Longer term, likely divergence of the market between type 1 and type 2 nickel, could see downside risk to our RKEF revenue forecast. Similiary, a move away from NMC battery technology could impact nickel demand flowing through to HPAL revenues. If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be greater than we anticipate, the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our target price. Likewise, if any of these factors proves to have less of an effect than we anticipate, the stock could outperform our target.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"-\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",
