We are particularly positive on NXT and are Buy rated given the rapid growth in cloud adoption, which has been supported by the continued evolution of the enterprise telecommunications market, and the significant demand by both public and private investors for digital infrastructure assets. We believe the company has a compelling growth profile and a proven and profitable business model, noting it trades on a growth- adjusted discount vs. peers, which we view as unjustified. Key risks to our view include: (1) Increased competition; (2) Timing of contracts; (3) Customer concentration; and (4) Execution risk on further expansions.",
