HVAC control components remained the core driver (+25% yoy growth for revenue and +53% yoy growth for net profit in 1H25), supported by commercial HVAC demand and rising contribution from low- AC penetration regions, with management now expecting at least 15% firmwide revenue growth and 20- 30% net profit growth in 2025E (vs. year beginning guidance of 10- 15% yoy for revenue/profit). AIDC liquid cooling was topical during the earnings call as Sanhua has long been supplying relevant components (valves, pumps, heat exchangers, CDUs) with its commercial HVAC exposure and the company newly disclosed the revenue size of Rmb1bn+ in 2024 already which we calculate at c.10% global market share and perceive that Sanhua probably has more exposure to data center room cooling than server cooling which is a beneficial buffer with China EV/HVAC growth moderation ahead. EV thermal management showed resilience despite Tesla's weakness (+9% yoy growth for segment revenue and +22% yoy growth for net profit in 1H25). While for humanoid robot actuators, the company guided stable market leadership and initial volume production to kick in from 3Q25 in Thailand factory despite market concerns on supply chain uncertainty as its customer is working on the robot redesign. GPM/NPM expanded meaningfully on the back of economies of scale, tighter cost control, and a favorable mix shift toward higher- margin commercial HVAC, which appear sustainable factors to drive margin improvement going forward. On the improved profitability outlook and revenue beat from HVAC, we raise up our 2025- 30E EPS forecast by 8- 11% and our new 12- m TP for Sanhua increase to Rmb32.7 and HK\\(34.4 (from Rmb30.4/HK\\)33.2\\).",

On the HVAC side, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver revenue growth above the residential HVAC industry, driven by commercial HVAC market share gain and ramp up in sensor products. On the EV side, we believe the company's revenue growth will be driven by further global EV penetration increase and modest content value gain. In addition, we see humanoid robots as a significant long- term technology trend with Sanhua likely to secure a key role in the supply chain, as a high visibility actuator assembler. Catalysts include technology advancement in humanoid robot functionality, volume production for humanoid robot big customers, and further EV penetration in Europe.
