      "text": "Given that OP looks set to reach ¥500bn-¥600bn in one year's time and that we continue to forecast an OPM of 7%-8% and RoE of 8%-9%, we see the stock as heavily undervalued with the PBR currently at 0.72x. While we see little that is likely to change the market's low assessment of the firm's shares and management in the near term, we expect the market to reassess Panasonic over the next year. The costs of headcount reductions are set to weigh on FY3/26 earnings, but we anticipate profit growth in FY3/27 driven by cost reductions. We also do not expect a major deterioration in sales to Tesla in the battery business. With subsidies (IRA 45X) continuing and demand for battery backup units for AI data centers also continuing to grow, we expect growing profit contributions from the battery business as a whole.",

      "text": "**Target price calculation** — The ¥100 reduction in our target price (to ¥2,100 from ¥2,200) reflects a decline in our estimate of business-derived equity value (separate from battery subsidies). The 6% reduction in business-derived equity value is the net result of a 9% drag from changes in our earnings forecasts and a 4% boost from changes in market multiples. For FY3/26, we lower our OP forecast significantly (to ¥332bn from ¥406bn) as we no longer anticipate ¥50bn of gains on business sales but lower our consolidated adjusted OP forecast by only ¥15bn, mainly in the home appliance and battery businesses. For FY3/27, we lower our OP forecast for home appliances slightly (adjusted OP down to ¥158bn from ¥165bn).",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"—\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",
