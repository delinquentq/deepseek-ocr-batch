While sales are tracking expectations for the industrial/automotive companies, visibility is low due to a high level of short- cycle orders.

      "text": "Low visibility for Q4 and beyond at industrial/Auto chip vendors: Most US and European auto/industrial chip suppliers have low backlog- based visibility for Q4 and beyond. Customers remain cautious in their order placement, with a high proportion of short cycle orders. Automotive customers are especially cautious, with many tier 1s driving down inventories to 2- 4 weeks, which chip vendors see as too low. This, however, does not indicate weak demand but only significant uncertainty in the environment due to tariffs and other factors. Revenues and earnings are expected to meet guidance and expectations in the quarter, despite the uncertain environment. None of the chip companies we talked to have seen any weakness versus expectations in their Automotive or Industrial sales so far in the quarter, with trends in Industrial remaining much stronger than in Automotive. However, the short- cycle nature of orders is not generating meaningful backlogs, resulting in low visibility. If this situation continues over the next two months, it is likely to lead to cautious FY26 guidance from Infineon, in our view. However, such low visibility and short cyclical ordering are normal at the early stages of an upcycle. While investors often expect a V- shaped recovery, we do not recall a V- shaped recovery in any previous cycle either. On the positive side, Inventories are low in most parts of the supply chain, and this combined with very cautious ordering is what typically leads to subsequent supply tightness. We expect both revenues and margins for the group to expand in 2026, with share prices likely to move up in anticipation. We therefore remain positive on STM, IFX, Melexis, and ams OSRAM.",

      "text": "Uncertainty on multiple fronts in the semicap world: As seen in recent quarterly results, trends at various US, European and Japanese semicap vendors are not aligned, with some seeing more positive trends than others. However, in our meetings, we found that uncertainty on their 2026 outlook is a common theme, much more so than in their 2025 outlook comments at the same stage in August. On the DRAM side, the view from front- end equipment vendors is that a qualification at Nvidia for Samsung Electronics would be negative at least for a few quarters. Samsung has been ordering equipment and adding capacity steadily, and a qualification would bring this excess capacity into play, likely limiting orders from SK Hynix and Micron. We also remain cautious on the HBM capacity expansion outlook for 2026, due to expectations of lower incremental hyperscaler capex and investments next year. China also remains a source of uncertainty into 2026, with most equipment vendors expecting China revenues to eventually normalise to the 20- 25% range. In advanced logic, Intel remains a source of uncertainty, though largely derisked in terms of expectations at ASML. Samsung's deal with Elon Musk is likely to have a material impact only beyond 2026, with some Taylor- related orders already in the backlog. While the share prices of European stocks like ASML, ASM, VAT, and SUSS somewhat reflect this 2026 uncertainty, we expect a further deterioration in semicap newsflow in coming quarters, which is likely to limit upside.",

The strength is coming from laser demand, mainly for data communications applications, but also from Lidar applications catering to the Chinese auto segment. Aixtron is cautious about extrapolating further growth in Opto into FY26, following the strength this year. SiC revenues were healthy in H1, coming mainly from China. These are expected to weaken in H2. However, GaN revenues are expected to be stable HoH in H2, with China once again being the primary source of demand. Aixtron believes it has over \\(90\\%\\) share in GaN in China and around \\(50\\%\\) share in SiC. The company sees a double- digit cost advantage to customers from its batch solutions versus single wafer solutions, and expects to get further tier 1 SiC customers outside China, as and when they start to expand their \\(8^{\\circ}\\) capacity.

However, the China revenue proportion is expected to eventually settle down at around \\(20\\%\\) . China has been stronger than expectations this year because there are now six companies that are significant buyers of its equipment in that market, compared to four last year. ASML does not believe there has been any pull- in in China. The company does not see Samsung's agreement with Tesla as making a significant near term difference, with some Taylor- related orders already in the backlog. That will have to be cleared before new orders are placed. Samsung's potential qualification at Nvidia is likely to trigger additional orders, though the revenue impact may be beyond 2026. As lead times on a low- NA EUV system are now down to 12 months from 15- 18 months previously, customers are now delaying their order placement. Gross margin on the NXE:3800E is now higher than immersion systems, while the gross margin of volume- based Services for EUV systems is now at \\(50\\%\\) . TSMC's EUV system requirements have reduced because ASML is able to lower downtime through its installed base management services.

Growth is healthy on the industrial side in the GIP and PSS divisions, but automotive customers are being very cautious and keeping inventories low. However, so far the company has not seen any weakness in the Chinese or US automotive segments. Content growth may be low into 2026 because of relatively high penetration of EVs in China and the delayed adoption of Software Defined Vehicles (SDV) in the US and Europe. Infineon is, however, benefiting from the faster adoption of SDV and zonal architectures at Chinese OEMs. The acquisition of Marvell's Ethernet business further increases its addressable market here. Infineon expects to take further share in Automotive MCUs in 2025, and possibly in subsequent years.

Customer inventories are back to normal and in some cases well below normal at 2- 4 weeks. However, customers remain cautious due to various macro uncertainties and are ordering very late. As a result, Melexis saw a significant amount of short cycle ordering in Q2, which is continuing in Q3. Despite these cautious ordering patterns, demand overall remains in- line with expectations, with no signs of an incremental weakening of automotive demand in any geography. The company, therefore, seems to be on track to at least meet guidance for the quarter. About \\(50\\%\\) of revenue is from powertrain- related applications (both EV and ICE) with the remaining \\(50\\%\\) from Body- Comfort- Safety applications. China is becoming a bigger part of Melexis revenues, on the back of strong design wins at OEMs and tier 1s in that market. Melexis sees only Novosense",

The 54H continues to be restricted to a few key customers given the current R&D intensity in designing in the SoC, with Nordic controlling the roll- out. The recent acquisitions of Memfault and Neuton AI reflect the CEO's focus in building a standalone business transforming Nordic from a hardware company to a complete solution's provider. Solutions to increase the share of wallet at customers include hardware bolts- ons (e.g., PMIC) and software services (e.g., over the cloud upgrades via Memfault). These bolts- on services will continue to run through distributors including software services (100% sales are currently through distributors). Current attach rates are low however, management expects the nRF54 design activity over the next 12- 18 months to be the critical entry point in increasing design wins for bolt- on solutions. Part of the focus here is increasing their competitiveness in the broader market with Nordic confident on the stickiness of these solutions once they have been implemented. The lack of attach rate targets for these businesses we believe is reflective of the early stage of these solutions, which are likely to take time to gain meaningful traction.",

There is limited visibility on Q4, though around 6- 7% QoQ growth would represent normal seasonality with Personal Electronics declining. The industrial channel is clean in China, but on a global basis there is around 1 month of excess inventory, all in the US and Europe. STM expects this inventory to be cleared by the end of this year, or by Q1- 26. Gross margin is expected to rise in Q4, with around 50 basis points coming from lower manufacturing inefficiencies. Other sources of upside include lower under- loading charges and a favourable product mix due to the seasonal weakening of Personal Electronics revenues. The currency impact is also expected to be neutral. STM may further reduce inventory slightly further from the targeted 140 days in Q3, but expects utilization levels to rise in the quarter despite this. In the medium term the company expects the proportion of industrial revenue to grow from the current low 20s to the low 30s, which is also expected to have a positive mix effect on gross margin. STM continues to target an increase in industrial MCU market share, helped by AI and its use of phase change memory. MCU production at HH Grace starts from Q4, which should also support share in China. The Sanan JV also starts SiC MOSFET production from Q4, with volumes expected to ramp based on design wins in China. As it uses primarily Chinese equipment, the fab is expected to give STM a cost advantage. STM expects to start shipping AI power devices to Nvidia from 2027 and aims to reach \\(500m\\) of AI power revenues by 2030.",

The company sees the likely qualification of Samsung at Nvidia as being potentially positive, with the customer expected to discuss follow- up orders on the back of its qualification. Orders have so far been weak from Samsung due to its excess capacity on the temporary border and debonder side. On the other hand, orders from Micron have been more stable. Around 30% of SUSS's total revenues are AI related, covering both temporary bonders/ debonders at HBM vendors and UV scanners for CoWoS patterning at TSMC. So far SUSS has been selling a UV scanner with a 2 micron resolution to TSMC, but the company is developing a 1 micron scanner which will also have a higher gross margin. This product is expected to be launched next year. Due to very strong orders from TSMC in the past 12- 18 months, SUSS has not been selling its UV scanners to other customers.
