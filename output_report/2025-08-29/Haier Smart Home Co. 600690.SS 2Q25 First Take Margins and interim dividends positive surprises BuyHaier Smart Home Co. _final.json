We are Buy rated on Haier A/H given: 1) resilient domestic growth on the back of market share gains (especially on lagging products like AC), and premiumization given its strong position in the premium segment via its Casarte brand; 2) improving overseas demand and FX tailwinds to mitigate discounts from competitors. We expect Haier to still deliver better- than- industry growth as it further expands product offerings and channels; 3) ongoing margin improvement potential from product mix improvements via premium brands in both domestic/overseas markets and operating efficiency gains mostly in the domestic market. We think current valuation offers attractive risk- reward with the shares currently trading below the historical median and expect further improvements from overseas demand and upcoming quarterly results to drive a re- rating of the stock.",

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
