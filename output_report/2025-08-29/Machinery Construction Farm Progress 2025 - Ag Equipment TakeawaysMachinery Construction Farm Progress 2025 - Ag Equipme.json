      "text": "2025 Farm Progress underscored Ag equipment demand continues to face uncertainty, but bolstered our conviction in Precision Ag proliferation. Demand commentary continues to point to farmers taking a cautious approach to ordering ahead of 2026. OEM preliminary outlooks for 2026, meanwhile, remain far more mixed. DE sounded cautiously optimistic on 2026 but noted it remains too early to tell given macro uncertainty. CNH alluded to an expectation for flattish global industry sales (NA flat to down and Europe/LatAm flat to up). AGCO meanwhile noted it continues to expect 2025 to mark the bottom and for all its four major regions to be up YoY in 2026. All in all, underscoring a lack of consensus and ongoing uncertainty around the demand outlook for 2026. Industry trends aside, product displays continue to highlight a focus on Precision Ag innovation, where the more notable takeaway in our view was a further divergence in the monetization strategies being implemented. DE noted moving its See & Spray product to a pay for what you save methodology while CNH has clearly moved further away from subscription based models in favor of one time capital cost models. Interestingly, both highlight their approaches as potential drivers of improved interest in adoption of new technology and demand for new products. And lastly, on the point of Precision Ag, this was the first year where we saw a material presence from aerial autonomous technology at Farm progress including the likes of Pyka (Pelican 2), Yamaha Fazer, and other drone manufacturers which we believe underscores our view that while we remain early days of adoption of newer autonomous technologies, we are nonetheless at a potentially meaningful inflection point where acceptance and interest in these technologies is becoming more widespread. Something which bodes well for future penetration of higher value Precision Ag technologies See below for detailed key takeaways from meetings with the three major Ag OEMs AGCO, CNH, and Deere.",

Deere then gets paid on a proportion of those savings, further aligning the company to its ability to add value to the farmer's operations and increasing farmer's ROI.- Autonomy: Today the company's efforts are focused on Tillage, but DE highlighted that learnings from tillage can accelerate rollout to other products over time, with adoption supported by flexible pay models such as usage-based or subscriptions.- Planters: Deere showcased its planter products, with a particular focus on its FurrowVision and ExactEmerge technologies. While its FurrowVision system was launched a couple of years ago, model year 2026 will be the first time the technology is available as a factory-installed option and not just as a retrofit.
