The FY25 result and guidance for FY26 were broadly in- line with JPME and consensus, whilst the pull forward of billing capacity drives upgrades to FY27 EBITDA. The company was also upbeat on the prospects of another record year of contract wins in FY26, which could drive billing from FY27/FY28+. NXT has appointed advisors to find a capital partner to build out S4 and S7, and in our view this materially de- risks a near- term capital raise as we see the business as being well funded for sites that are currently under construction. Near term, we see the pending approval of the S5 facility as a potential catalyst for the stock, with mgmt sounding confident on the call.",

      "text": "- NextDC operates best-in-class facilities in the industry with high barriers to entry.- NextDC is the first data center operator in the world to achieve Tier IV certification by The Uptime Institute on its second-generation data centers without having a full \\(2N + 1\\) redundancy system. This allows NextDC not only to attract customers that require best-in-class data center facilities, but also to operate with a lower fixed-cost base than competitors.- Continued exponential growth in data and cloud computing remains a secular tailwind for data centers.- While NextDC has been able to ride the remarkable \\(20\\% +\\) CAGR of cloud computing, IT outsourcing and data usage growth over the last five years, we do not expect exponential growth to slow anytime soon. Cisco estimates high-teens growth in cloud computing globally, while Internet traffic and data usage continue to grow at \\(20\\% +\\) annually.- We estimate a mid-to-high-teens IRR on second-generation data centers.- NextDC has achieved a low- to mid-\\(20\\%\\) IRR on its first-generation data centers in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. With capacity selling out within five to seven years and continued growth in Interconnectivity revenues, the company has proven its expertise in building out top-tier data centers and is able to attract a strong ecosystem of telecom vendors and partners. We estimate that the second-generation data centers will achieve mid- to high-teens returns despite being many times larger. These are favourable returns compared to its WACC of \\(7.4\\%\\) .- Global expansion by large data center operators could drive industry M&A.- As the recent acquisitions of Metronode by Equinix, Ascenty by Digital Realty, Zenium by CyrusOne and CyrusOne's strategic partnership with GDS Holdings show, US-based data center operators are looking to expand internationally in order to meet customer demand. With long lead times for construction and difficulty securing prime real estate in metros, it makes more sense for these operators to acquire data centers than to build them themselves, in our view. This is particularly true if the data centers are recently built and are up to the highest standards, like those of NextDC.",
