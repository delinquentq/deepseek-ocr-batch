ROA/ROE fell -2bp/-89bp y-y to 0.54%/10.5% in 2Q25. PSBC announced 1H25 DPS of RMB0.1230 (-16.7% y-y), mainly due to equity dilution of -17.2% from recapitalization, more than offsetting the 1H25 NPAT growth of +0.8% y-y.

Fee income accelerated to +16.3% y-y in 2Q25 (vs. +8.8% y-y in 1Q25), to account for 7.3% of total revenue in 2Q (+0.8ppt y-y), likely thanks to improved wealth mgmt./ investment banking fee income, +48%/+41% y-y in 1H25 amid improved investor sentiment. **Dealing gain** grew +30.7% q-q/+34.0% y-y to reach RMB13.3bn in 2Q25, to form 14.7% total revenue in 2Q (+3.4ppt q-q/+3.4ppt y-y) likely thanks to more favorable bond market condition in 2Q; CIR was reduced by -7.7ppt y-y to 53.7% in 2Q25, likely thanks to reduced deposit agency fee payment to the bank's Parent Group after fee rate re-negotiation (-8.9% y-y in 1H25); **CET1/ tier-1/Total CAR** were up by +131bp/+127bp/+123bp q-q to 10.52%/12.13%/14.57% in 2Q25, thanks to RMB130bn equity recapitalization, which boosted CET1 ratio by 139bp based on 2Q25 RWA.

Asset quality: NPL ratio was up +1bp q- q to 0.92% in 2Q25, likely due to increased retail NPL ratio, +10bp h- h to 1.38% in 1H25 (w/ higher NPL ratio observed across consumption loan/mortgage/micro loans/ credit card loans, up +14bp/+9bp/+9bp/+7bp h- h to 1.47%/0.73%/2.29%/1.55% in 1H25), more than offsetting the modest corporate NPL ratio reduction by - 5bp h- h to 0.49% in 1H25.

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation.
