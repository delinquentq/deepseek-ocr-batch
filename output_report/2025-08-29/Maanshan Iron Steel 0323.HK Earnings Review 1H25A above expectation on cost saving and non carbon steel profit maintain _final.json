Excluding one- off items including impairment loss and investment income, recurring net profit turned to positive Rmb29mn, versus recurring net loss of Rmb1.0bn in 1H24A. The result was better than our expectation and Bloomberg consensus, mostly due to better than expected non- carbon steel profit and cost savings.

The QoQ improvement in unit gross profit was nearly Rmb150/t, much ahead of peers and our expectation, mostly driven by non- carbon steel and cost saving efforts. On the industry level, while ongoing disciplined steel production, albeit not consistent, is leading to mild recovery in unit steel profit in the industry. A fundamental change in the industry remains to be seen in terms of sustainable output control and capacity management - we see positive direction of travel, but more visibility needed. We expect unit profit to mildly improve in 2H25E HoH, and potential further improvement in 2026E assuming industry level supply work emerges.

The company's production mix includes \\(45\\%\\) construction steel and flat products, and train wheels, supplying end markets including property, auto, appliances, and railway. The QoQ improvement in unit gross profit was nearly Rmb150/t, much ahead of peers and our expectation, mostly driven by non- carbon steel and cost saving efforts. On the industry level, while ongoing disciplined steel production, albeit not consistent, is leading to mild recovery in unit steel profit in the industry. A fundamental change in the industry remains to be seen in terms of sustainable output control and capacity management - we see positive direction of travel, but more visibility needed. We expect unit profit to mildly improve in 2H25E HoH, and potential further improvement in 2026E assuming industry level supply work emerges.",

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
