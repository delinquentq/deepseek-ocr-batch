The licenses span over 400 markets and will bolster AT&T's mid- and low- band spectrum holdings, with deployment expected to begin immediately. AT&T affirmed its FY25 guidance and reiterated prior capital return plans, including \\(\\) 20bn\\$ of repurchase capacity between 2025 and 2027, with a consistent approach expected through 2029. Post- transaction, net leverage is expected to rise to 3.0x, with a goal to return to 2.5x within three years. While the deal is a near- term credit negative given the combined leverage and buyback ambitions, we view this as AT&T pulling forward expected spectrum spend ahead of upcoming government auctions. The regulatory backdrop remains uncertain, DOJ officials have expressed concern over further spectrum consolidation among the Big Three carriers, and AT&T's ability to secure approval is still in question. However, the seller, Echostar, is under pressure from the FCC to either build or divest their spectrum holdings, and AT&T CEO John Stankey noted that, based on his conversations with regulators, \"they're interested in seeing fallow spectrum move into service as quickly as possible.\" Additionally, Axios recently reported that the Trump Administration views AT&T as a \"good partner.\" We continue to view U.S. Telecom as a defensive sector, but recently downgraded AT&T to Neutral after spreads tightened inside Verizon with refinancing risk rising amid a heavy slate of upcoming maturities and funding needs for both this transaction and the pending Lumen deal.",

We maintain our Neutral rating on Intel given the significant execution challenges that remain for both IFS and Intel Products, but continue to express a more positive view through our Overweight rating on Foundry JV, which remains mispriced relative to Intel's curve and offers further upside potential.",

The report noted that the firms are interested in \"one of the largest pots of underused airwaves,\" but did not specify which bands are of interest. It also said that T-Mobile initially expressed interest in acquiring \"nearly all of EchoStar's licenses,\" and is still in talks to acquire some of the pieces that AT&T did not buy. We expect spectrum spend to become a much more relevant wrinkle in the domestic Telecom story over the next 18 months, and anticipate that T-Mobile and Verizon will shift some of their capital allocation priorities towards outlays for spectrum holdings in upcoming auctions.",

The company booked \\(\\) 5.6bn\\(in AI server orders and shipped\\) \\ \\(8.2bn\\) , bringing YTD AI shipments to \\(\\) 10bn\\(, already ahead of FY25, and raised FY26 AI revenue guidance by\\) \\ \\(5bn\\) to \\(\\) 20bn\\(. While the AI ramp is gross dollar accretive, it remains margin dilutive in the near term, particularly as Dell pushed aggressively on early Blackwell deployments and incurred one-time supply chain costs, which are expected to abate in 2H. Traditional server demand improved internationally but remained soft in North America, where federal demand was cited as a drag. On the CSG side, commercial PCs grew modestly while consumer declined, but margins improved in a deflationary environment and Windows 10 end-of-life remains a near-term tailwind. Dell expects stronger profitability in F4Q, driven by a mix shift toward margin-accretive storage, normalization of AI-related supply chain costs, and operating expense discipline. Inventory trends were not explicitly detailed, though the company continues to tightly manage supply. Management noted that tariffs and geopolitical dynamics have been well-handled, with no material customer impact.",

While management highlights AI PC momentum, now over 25% of mix, ahead of internal timelines, it is unclear how durable this demand surge is, especially given skepticism from channel checks and CIO commentary around enterprise adoption. The PC growth story remains heavily reliant on the Windows 11 refresh, a tailwind that is inherently finite and already halfway through penetration. On Print, the outlook is uninspiring as office hardware demand remains soft, competitive pricing pressures",

Despite significant commentary around cost mitigation and manufacturing diversification (with most U.S.- bound products now built outside of China), the benefits are still being absorbed rather than accretive. Trade- related costs remain a headwind, and pricing leverage appears limited in the current environment. Capital allocation remained disciplined, and repurchases were muted in the quarter as leverage crept up above the 2.0x threshold, though macro uncertainty and limited margin expansion levers leave little room for upside surprises.

      "text": "- Intel (INTC): CFO David Zinsner presented at an industry conference this week and emphasized progress on the company's capital structure, balance sheet, and foundry strategy, underpinned by a wave of external funding and a sharpened focus on execution. Intel secured \\(5.7bn in equity from the U.S. government (as discussed here), plus\\)2bn from SoftBank and \\~\\)1bn from divesting Mobileye shares. The Altera close is expected to bring in an additional \\$3.5bn this quarter, and the firm intends to repay its \\~\\$3.8bn in upcoming 2025 maturities, and intends to do the same with its 2026 maturities. While the government now owns \\~10% of Intel, the stake is viewed as strategically aligned, giving Intel certainty of funding and credibility with potential foundry customers. Related warrants are structured to expire worthless unless Intel loses majority ownership of the foundry business, reinforcing its long-term control. Importantly, Intel reaffirmed plans to eventually bring in external customers into the foundry entity, whether strategic or financial, but not before the business reaches a more autonomous and operationally mature state. On the technology front, management framed the ramp of 18A as foundational for future nodes, while 14A is viewed as strategically critical yet ROI-dependent on winning third-party foundry customers. Intel will not commit capex toward 14A unless customer volume justifies it, signaling a more disciplined capital framework under new management. The company views 2026-2028 as the critical window for proving 14A's viability.",

Management highlighted ongoing lumpiness in the custom silicon business but emphasized visibility into a broadening design-win pipeline that should support sustained share gains over the next several years. The recent \\$2.5bn divestiture of the automotive Ethernet unit further sharpened strategic focus and provided balance sheet flexibility, with proceeds earmarked for buybacks and selective AI-focused investments. Leverage metrics continue to trend lower, aided by \\$1bn in recent debt repayment, leaving gross leverage at \\~1.6x EBITDA and net leverage at \\~1.2x, levels manageable against volatile but structurally growing cash flow.

      "text": "J.P. Morgan uses a bond- level rating system that incorporates valuations (relative value) and our fundamental view on the security. Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).",
