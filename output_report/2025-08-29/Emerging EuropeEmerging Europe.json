We have lowered our 3Q growth forecast to \\(0.5\\% q / q\\) , saar, from \\(1.25\\%\\) previously, and suspect that risks are probably still skewed to the downside. Continued softness in growth data amid better- behaved inflation suggests that the CBR will continue the easing cycle in the coming months. Moreover, given the perceived distribution of risks for growth and inflation, this will likely result in more front- loaded cuts in the near- term. We now expect the CBR to cut 200bp to \\(16.0\\%\\) (17.0 previously) at the upcoming September meeting and the key rate to end the year at \\(14.0\\%\\) (15.0).",

Consumption remains supported by solid labor income gains. Unemployment has remained steady at a very low \\(2.2\\%\\) , sa, in past three months, while nominal wage growth has been running in the mid- teens. The latter implies substantial real wage growth ( \\(5.1\\%\\) oya in July), running ahead of productivity gains, which will likely maintain inflation inertia in the services part of CPI basket in the coming months. Yet, business surveys already point to a softening in labor demand. We anticipate a cooling of the labor market to follow output growth as a whole with a lag, but mostly via work hours and pay growth rather than headline employment.",
