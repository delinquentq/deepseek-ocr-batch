Overall, the pulse check on iron ore markets in China remains somewhat muted, with fundamentals unsupportive of material upside to prices, but cost curves acting as downside support. We view the China anti- involution trade as real, but still lacking near- term on- the- ground follow through, suggesting recent upward moves have been largely sentiment driven.

The cost- out program was overshadowed by weak results from the Behring division in 2H (attributed to the loss of tenders) and the admission that the GM will take longer to recover. While management downplayed these issues, the risk of heightened competition and sector oversupply were key investor issues, although we are less concerned on this front. The company also announced the spin- off of Seqirus, which will further muddy the waters given the complexity of the transaction. Given these concerns and the heavily second half skewed results, the near term outlook is underwhelming. However, after the price drop, we have retained our Overweight rating given the upside to our \\(\\) 282\\(price target (previously\\) \\ \\(305\\) ).",
