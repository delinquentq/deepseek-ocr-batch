The key catalysts flagged in our initiation have largely played out: we saw Keeta's expansion to Talabat's markets (Qatar launched, UAE/Kuwait likely coming soon); Talabat started to revise its margin guidance after 2Q25 (FY25 guidance implies \\(\\sim 0.5\\) pp margin decline in 2H25 vs. 1H25); the market is now pricing \\(\\sim 4.5 - 5\\%\\) LT EBITDA/GMV margin, in line with our expectations. Our estimates and AED1.2 TP are unchanged, now implying a positive TSR, hence we upgrade the stock to Neutral.

While Meituan maintained its positive view on Keeta's international expansion targets (reaching RMB100bn GMV by 2033), 2Q25 profit warning due higher domestic competition (see Alicia Yap's downgrade) could be viewed as incrementally positive for Talabat given potentially lower spend on aggressive expansion by Keeta.",

Higher competition will likely constrain Talabat's margins, which we think are close to their peaks, however, we think it is reflected in the current price (market- implied margin is close to our expectations).",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.

The securities of non- U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Foreign companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for exact dividend computations.
