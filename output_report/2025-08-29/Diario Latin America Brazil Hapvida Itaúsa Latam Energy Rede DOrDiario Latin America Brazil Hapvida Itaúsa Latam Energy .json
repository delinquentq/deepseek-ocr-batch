Lula's approval dropped in August, reversing gains from his trade dispute with Trump, while Tarcisio now leads him in a key poll for the first time. Despite Brazil's resilience to Trump's tariffs, Lula's declining popularity amid strong economic performance signals fatigue and disconnection with his base. A center- right shift in the electorate (given the rise of the evangelical church and PT fatigue in Northeast) suggests a setup for a reformist candidate in 2026, especially with Bolsonaro likely out. Markets could rally early if Tarcisio gains traction, given his expected market- friendly agenda as seen as Governor of Sao Paulo, in our view. Companies such as Assai, Bradesco, Magazine Luiza, Lojas Quero- Quero, Renner, the car rental companies, payments and infrastructure concessions are amongst the most sensitive players to the rates cycle.

Hence, there is scope for a reformist, center- right candidate could win and govern with an aligned Congress- an unprecedented outcome that could unlock long- term economic growth and structural reforms. In addition to the right- leaning congress, Lula's path to reelection is narrower than in 2022, constrained by the rising influence of the evangelical church, and the limited room for expansion of the PT strongholds like the Northeast.
