The y/y increase is primarily due to (i) higher gold prices, (ii) S45X advanced manufacturing production credits, and (iii) reduced losses from US PGM ops, partially offset by operational constraints at SA PGM/gold ops that led to inventory build and lower sales, and other factors.

We think the poor sales performance in TRU Africa in H2 25 hampered any opportunity to grow profits, despite better GPM. Thus, further sales declines presents downside to risk to profits in TRU Africa in FY 26e. Office UK delivered a pleasant profitability, although missing by 5% on EBIT.

While we do not expect a rapid reversal in margins or sentiment, we do think i) sequential margins can improve in FY26E, and ii) relative EPS momentum has found its floor. Very low expectations, tariff certainty, 'less bad' EPS momentum, strategic dialogue on EU CO2 rules and increased restructuring savings FY26 vs 25 create positive risk- reward into seasonally stronger year- end, in our view. We continue to see Volkswagen and Porsche as good ways to position from here, sticking with our Buy ratings. The key risk remains any credit/macro deterioration moving into 2H25.",

We believe US rates can adjust further, allowing for positive EMFX developments. That said, a stubborn 5- 30s steepening bias may persist. EMFX carry strategies remain positive, cushioned by interest rate differentials. Key economic data over the next few weeks may suggest a Fed cut in September, but the US economy could reflate faster than expected, challenging EM assets. Our view remains positive interest rate risk in EM, supported by EMFX contributions to total returns in portfolios. We remain positive on EM interest rate risk, expecting EMFX to contribute to portfolio returns.

In our view, the new budget draft underscores challenges faced by the Polish government, including the need to maintain high defense spending despite limited space to increase taxes. The budget draft does not change much in the inflation trajectory and still leaves some space for rate cuts, but we see the risk that the MPC may turn hawkish anyway and be tempted to spread easing over a longer time.

Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities.

At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns.

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation.
