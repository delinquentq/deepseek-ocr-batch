      "text": "We think Japan's corporate reform, led by companies and the market, is in a self- sustaining phase. In 2024, progress was evident in terms of increases in shareholder payouts and corporate investment, M&A/takeover deals, and activist investors' proposals. The TSE reforms that we referred to last year as \"chapter 2\" of corporate reform heightened awareness among mainly low- P/B companies. The next phase, effectively \"chapter 3,\" should lead companies to accelerate their reorganization, balance sheet reforms, and disposals of idle assets on their own or in response to market pressure. Corporate investment has turned upward, setting the stage for growth rather than equilibrium- focused downsizing. In this report, we present 10 facts on corporate reform progress and outline the potential over the next few years. We expect companies to increase their total payout ratio to \\(70\\%\\) to optimize their balance sheets, and their ROEs should reach \\(10\\%\\) in FY2026 and \\(11\\%\\) in FY2028 with growth investments and market reform effects (the removal of low- ROE companies from TOPIX). In the process, the reevaluation that did not occur for Japanese equities even amid the unusual corporate actions in FY2024 should materialize; the market's P/E should reach 17- 18x, matching that during the prior restructuring phase (the Koizumi era, 2001- 06); and TOPIX may come close to 4,400 and the Nikkei 225 near 60,000 in three years. We view this medium- term structural change as a solid theme that supports Japanese equities beyond the near- term uncertain global economic cycle.",

      "text": "More than \\(90\\%\\) of TSE Prime Market companies have announced Apr- Jun results. With Japan and the US having agreed on a \\(15\\%\\) tariff rate, the focus this earnings season was the impact of this on corporate earnings. Corporates have started to show their overall view of tariff impact, and while it is yet to emerge, we think the market has adequately priced in negative impact. In fact, we see signs that companies could begin to lower their tariff impact estimates and raise earnings guidance as early as 1H results as they take countermeasures. In the autos sector, where much of tariff impact is concentrated, once automakers start to pass on costs, changes in the balance between prices and export volumes could start to influence investment decisions. Apr- Jun results were \\(\\text{wk}\\) , as the market expected, due to the impact of tariffs (mainly \\(25\\%\\) automobile tariffs) and one- off factors for electricity and gas, with net profit falling nearly \\(20\\%\\) YoY (- 2.6% excluding the impact of the two aforementioned factors). Going forward, tariff impact should decline as auto tariffs fall from \\(25\\%\\) to \\(15\\%\\) from August and countermeasures begin to take effect. Shareholder returns growth also appears to have temporarily stalled in July- September due to uncertainty caused by tariffs. However, a breakdown by sector shows returns are slowing in some sectors, such as autos, but continuing to grow in many others. This suggests corporate reforms continue unabated.",

Based on supply- demand conditions, we estimate the market sentiment index is in euphoria territory, suggesting it needs to cool down soon (Figure 1). Rather than rushing toward 45,000, it would be better for stability if the Nikkei 225 consolidated around the 42,000 level. Over a somewhat longer horizon (around three months), however, the moving average of the sentiment index has clearly settled into positive territory. We note the leading relationship",

As shown in Figure 35, Orgovyx's US prescription trends have been solid, and we expect a guidance hike at 2Q FY2025 results. Daiichi Sankyo's share price rose sharply after I- DXd received a breakthrough therapy designation. Its small meeting with management for sell- side analysts also gave a positive impression. However, the share price fell back to the level it had been at due to what we believe was unwinding of cross- shareholdings. With data on I- DXd due to be presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) 2025 on September 7, we think the share price might rise again heading into this event. Figure 7 shows events scheduled by sector companies, and Figures 8- 10 show the catalyst calendar. Figure 13 and on show US prescription trends.",

Over the past three months, key sector issues have been shifting from uncertainty over tariffs to 1) the rising likelihood of tariff impact easing, 2) earnings improvement from lower environmental regulation costs, and 3) an increased likelihood of market share gains for Japanese autos. Under a \\(15\\%\\) auto tariff, we calculate the net tariff impact for major automakers such as Toyota and Honda will be only \\(8\\%\\) of FY2024 operating profit, and combined with a decline in compliance costs from recent regulatory easing, the net impact could be almost nil. A relaxation or elimination of environmental regulations could create a demand shift back from BEVs to HEVs and ICE vehicles and contribute to market share gains for Japanese autos. Toyota remains our top sector pick, and we upgrade Nissan from Underweight to Neutral.",

Despite its high efficacy, with 13- week weight loss of \\(12.2\\%\\) for the 120mg dose, VK2735 also showed high occurrence of side effects, with a significant percentage of subjects dropping out of the trial. This led to a \\(42.12\\%\\) decline in Viking's share price from the previous day (Nasdaq: - 1.46%). These results and the results for oral peptide amycretin and oral small molecule CT- 996 reported in 2024 have reconfirmed that rapid weight loss in a short time can lead to high occurrence of side effects. While we expect the optimal titration regimen for each pipeline product to be verified, we emphasize again that orforgipron has shown a superior balance between efficacy and tolerability. Figures 1 & 2 compare the weight loss achieved by each pipeline product, while Figure 3 shows the occurrence of side effects. See Figure 4 for details. While orforgipron has achieved smaller weight loss at 72 weeks than other oral drugs, it has also caused side effects less frequently.",
