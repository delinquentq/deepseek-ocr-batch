Our key takeaways include: 1) Management maintained full- year target to achieve positive growth for both its revenue and profits despite declines in 2Q and 1H. Management expect product and channel expansion (e.g. Al smart lighting with first flagship store opened) to drive growth off an easier base. 2) Management remained constructive on overseas expansion that they have collaborated with large distributors in key markets. Management noted potential from both product category inclusion and region expansion (from mainly South- East Asia to also DM and other emerging markets). 3) Management continued to guide stable and healthy margins. Management mentioned the company would further enrich the product matrix to both high- end and mass markets, while margins wouldn't be impacted together with internal cost reduction. Management also see stable expense investment, though branding investment declined yoy on a high base last year.",
