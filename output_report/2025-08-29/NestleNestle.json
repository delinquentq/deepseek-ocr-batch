      "text": "We attended today Nestle's sell- side meeting, with CEO Laurent Freixe and CFO Anna Manz. Overall management struck a reassuring tone on some of the key discussion points post H125 results. On RIG, they expect that Q2 25 was likely to be the low point and noting that coffee elasticity continues to be less than they expected and they are largely done with price increases in confectionery (whilst some competitors continue to take pricing). Management noted that RIG deceleration has been driven by China and NHSc, whilst the remaining \\(88\\%\\) of the Group has seen steady and stable RIG development as pricing has accelerated. Into 2026, the company is expecting improvement in RIG and market share as well as a recovery in underlying trading operating margin vs 2025 (with an easing commodity costs backdrop, notably in coffee). On FCF, the company expects FY FCF above CHF 8bn, enough to cover the dividend, while announced divestments and Froneri dividend to support deleveraging. Overall after the stock was penalized post H125 results, the message was reassuring both on FCF and overall FY25 delivery - as such should provide some short term support given the de- rating of the shares looks extreme, now trading ex- L'Oreal on 14x PE 26E. We remain Neutral as we prefer BN (OW) and ULVR (OW) both offering stronger volume- led growth delivery while visibility on Nestle's RIG returning to \\(2\\% +\\) still remains low at a time of slower growth in its two major divisions Coffee and Pet Food.",

      "text": "Key take- aways from sell- side meeting: 1) RIG development - the company indicated that Q2 RIG performance was likely to be the low point at the Group level. The company noted that RIG performance in the \\(88\\%\\) of the business excluding China and Nestle Health Science (NHSc.) was broadly stable for the last 4 quarters, even as pricing has picked up, and RIG slowdown for the Group has been attributable to China and NHSc. 2) Elasticities - elasticity in coffee has remained less than they expected, and Nestle commented that the typical trend in European markets is for an initial reaction to price increases as consumer may delay purchases, but that these are short- lived (a matter of weeks). Roast & ground category is the most challenged with highest price increases, with some benefit for soluble coffee. In confectionery they see elasticity in the middle of the ranges of 0.4- 1.0 given by competitors (and highest in L- America, especially Brazil) albeit they are largely complete with their price increases in the category. 3) Market growth - the company sees their categories growing \\(3 - 4\\%\\) MT, but also sees their categories growing in this range currently. Excluding the extraordinary pricing in coffee/ confectionery, they see their markets still growing at the low end of the range. 4) Greater China - the company is correcting for 3- 4 weeks of excess stock. The pressure to growth from actions should take a few quarters but building up demand- led model muscle will take more time. 5) Margin building blocks - the company noted that the margin guidance reiteration of at or above \\(16.0\\%\\) came despite worse commodity, FX and tariff cost, noting that commodity cost phasing is more H2 than H1. 6) A&P - the company reiterated that it will be at around \\(9\\%\\) spend, getting to it in 2026. But A&P has picked up faster in H1",

Plus they noted deleveraging will be supported by announced divestments and Froneri dividend. 9) 2026 comments - for 2026 the company is looking to improve RIG and market share and see recovery in UTOP margin vs 2025 (including easier commodity costs, notably slight benefit from coffee).",

Pet and coffee growth is normalising after a strong 2020- 23, at the same time as the growth profile of the remainder of the business has been pressured. On margins, Nestle should face headwinds to further Gross Margin improvement in 2025 as some key input prices have increased (coffee and cocoa), whilst the company may need to reinvest against historically low SG&A percent of sales. Meanwhile, a highly levered balance sheet at close to 3x net debt / EBITDA leaves little scope for further share buy- backs or DPS growth, limiting TSR potential.",
