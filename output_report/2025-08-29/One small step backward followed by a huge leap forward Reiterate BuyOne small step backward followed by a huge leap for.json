The miss is driven by lower revenues, which came in at &#36;285 million versus our &#36;296 million estimate. Its VLCCs, Suezmaxes and Aframax/LR2s averaged &#36;43,100/day, &#36;38,900/day and &#36;29,300/day, respectively. Its VLCC and Aframax/LR2 rates come in below our estimates of &#36;45,000/day and &#36;35,000/day, respectively, while its Suezmax rate came in slightly above our expectation of &#36;37,500/day.

The company indicated that final averages will likely be softer given the impact of ballast days, thus we are modeling final averages of &#36;36,000/day on its VLCCs, &#36;36,000/day on its Suezmaxes and &#36;33,500/day on its Aframaxes/LR2s. Our 3Q estimate remains unchanged at &#36;0.28/sh (consensus is currently at &#36;0.38).

As previously announced, it refinanced its existing &#36;1.4 billion credit facility for the 24 Euronav VLCCs acquired last year at a lower rate margin.

The tanker market is highly volatile with spot rates changing on an ongoing daily and intra- daily basis due to tanker vessel supply and charterer demand changes. The sector is dependent on seaborne oil volumes, which historically are driven by OPEC and non- OPEC production. Should higher and or lower oil volumes come to market, it could have a materially upwards or downwards impact on charter rates. Tanker newbuilding and secondhand prices are driven by charter rates and shipyard construction costs with changes in steel and labor major factors in overall costs. Higher interest rates typically are associated with declining ship values while lower interest rates could lead to higher values. The changes in ship values therefore impact the balance sheet and various leverage ratios.",
