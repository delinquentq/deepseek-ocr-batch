Based on prior disclosures and the most recent 10- K filing, we estimate that Customer A's quarterly revenue contribution was down \\(\\) 250\\(mn qoq to \\)\\sim \\(\\) 780\\(mn, or\\) 13.6\\%\\(of total revenue. We also estimate that Customer D's revenue contribution was\\) \\ \\(0\\) mn in the quarter but still \\(11.1\\%\\) for the full year.

While SMCI's market share among some of the largest GPU-specialized cloud service providers to date has been impressive & demand among AI CSPs remains robust, we view the AI server market as increasingly competitive as the product becomes more commoditized,ultimately pressuring profitability. Further, we believe SMCI's opportunity to address enterprise AI infrastructure demand in the medium term will also be competitive,particularly given more enterprise-focused IT hardware suppliers such as DELL and CSCO.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
