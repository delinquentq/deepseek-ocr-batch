First, he said if the rise in food prices is due to supply factors, it should not be immediately addressed with a rate hike. However, he also stated that if food price- led inflation persists, it could raise underlying inflation through the expectations channel, and thus needs to be closely monitored. Figure 3 attempts to verify the latter. Comparing energy and food inflation rates (Sy moving average), which are of great concern to households, with household inflation expectations, it can be seen that much of the sharp rise in such expectations since 2023 can be explained by prolonged food inflation. This suggests that the latter condition is being met. Additionally, the reasons for food price increases have now significantly expanded to include transport costs and labor costs, which also contribute to the wage- price dynamics emphasized by the BoJ (Figure 4).",

However, as highlighted in the summary of opinions at the January MPM, rate cuts in the US imply a reduction in policy flexibility for the BoJ since they typically accompany JPY appreciation. Looking back over the past quarter- century, the BoJ has never raised rates while the FOMC was in a rate- cutting phase. In this phase, we believe that the \"jinn\" will finally be broken due to the significantly weaker JPY compared to the past, but many rate hikes may still be challenging. It is almost unprecedented for Japanese and US monetary policies to move in opposite directions during the same period, and there is extreme uncertainty about the direction of exchange rates. In this context, if the BoJ takes too long to assess the impact of tariffs on next spring's wage negotiations, it risks missing the opportunity to raise rates. Conversely, it may be worth considering the option of raising rates early in the US rate- cutting phase, while there is still leeway in terms of exchange rate levels.",

According to recent public opinion polls conducted by various media outlets, however, the approval rating of the Ishiba administration has risen significantly in most, though it is still at a low level. Additionally, the number of respondents who believe \"Prime Minister Ishiba should resign\" has significantly decreased, and those who think \"there is no need for resignation\" now have the upper hand. Meanwhile, the LDP has held a meeting of its Presidential Election Management Committee and begun discussions on an extraordinary presidential election. The first agenda item was the method of confirming intentions, and for party- affiliated members of the Diet, the Committee decided to conduct it with a signed document and disclose the names of those in favor of the election. There is a view that these arrangements could reduce the number of votes to hold an early election. Considering all these factors comprehensively, although the situation remains highly fluid, there seems to be a slightly increasing possibility that the current administration will carry on for now. While even in this case the Ishiba administration would remain a minority government with a fragile hold on power, such a scenario could at least make it easier for the BoJ to stay on the normalization path as it has to date.",

      "text": "Superlong JGB ASW cheapness has faded since May but re- cheapening risks remain amid fiscal concerns, and further JGB issuance reduction is likely needed for a fundamental adjustment. JPY swap spreads' fair value macro dynamics can be explained by supply- demand factors, such as JGB issuance and BoJ QE/QT, funding rates differentials and rate hike expectations. Under such a model, superlong ASW appear cheap but we cannot rule out the risk of further widening due to fiscal risk. Swap spreads are also correlated with term premium, which suggests that a worsening of fiscal concerns or supply demand could lead to a sharp widening in swap spreads. Swap spreads tend to behave differently by tenor in each rate phase but movements in the 10y sector tend to be larger on both higher or lower rates. In comparison to overseas markets, the relative cheapness of JGB in terms of xccy ASW has faded and hence is unlikely to spur much investment inflow over the 1y sector. Meanwhile, CCP spreads are on a tightening trend.",

In the 5-10y sector, buying will likely tend to target issues such as JX15-17 and JX19 due in part to coupon levels. In the 1-5y, issues such as JX1-3 and JL116-117 will likely be buying targets.",
