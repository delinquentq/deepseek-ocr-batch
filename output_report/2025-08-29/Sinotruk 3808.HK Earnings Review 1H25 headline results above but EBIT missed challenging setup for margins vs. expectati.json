EBIT (+5% yoy) came in 3% below our previewed estimate, mainly due to weaker- than- expected top- line growth (only up \\(+4\\%\\) yoy), with HDT volume growth partially offset by ASP decline across both domestic and overseas.

We continue to believe the market has overestimated Sinotruk's operating leverage from the domestic HDT cycle recovery (due to the rising electrification) while underestimated the impact of the steeper- than- expected decline in exports into the CIS region, which has an outsized impact to Sinotruk's earnings (relative to its volume contribution given high pricing and unit profitability).",
