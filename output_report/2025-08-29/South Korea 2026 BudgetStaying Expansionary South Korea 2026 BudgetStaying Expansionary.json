The consolidated budget deficit is set at - 2.0% of GDP (or - KRW53.8trn), which is higher than 0.8% from the original 2025 budget and slightly lower than - 2.3% after two supplementary budgets. Government expenditure is to rise 8.1% from the 2025 main budget, marking the strongest increase since 2022, while revenue is to rise 3.5% on cyclical recovery in tax collection and other revenue measures including higher securities transaction tax. To finance the deficit, KTB issuance will rise to KRW232trn (or 8.6% of GDP) from KRW228trn in 2025. Beyond 2026, the government's medium- term fiscal plan entails sustained managed budget deficits of 4.0- 4.4% of GDP over the next four years, leading to a rapid increase in government debt from 49.1% of GDP in 2025 to 58.0% in 2029.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
