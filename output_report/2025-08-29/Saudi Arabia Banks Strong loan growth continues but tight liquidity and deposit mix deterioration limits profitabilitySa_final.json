      "text": "We believe July data represents a continuation of the positive trends in lending observed in the Saudi banking sector ytd. However, Saudi banks' cost of time deposits may have marginally increased, as can be inferred from the SAIBOR bid data which showed an increase, contributing to a decline in profitability, in our view, with monthly profit before zakat and taxes reaching SR8.2bn in July (down \\(16\\%\\) mom, but up \\(7\\%\\) yoy). Demand deposits decreased during the month, while time deposits increased by \\(3\\%\\) mom, leading to a sequential deterioration in the demand deposit ratio by 1.5pp to \\(50\\%\\) . This is while the headline LDR increased c.1.5pp mom to \\(112\\%\\) , reflecting the low funding headroom and tight liquidity across the sector. Corporate loans were the main driver of loan growth at \\(14\\%\\) ytd while retail loan growth came in at \\(3\\%\\) ytd. We think corporate loan growth remains on track to register low- to mid- teens growth in 2025, and our analysis of project pipelines suggests the corporate loan CAGR could remain at low double digits until the end of the decade, even under a lower oil price scenario. We also anticipate retail lending picking up momentum on further rate cuts.",

As such, we have a preference for banks with a larger retail loan tilt, although we acknowledge these could face some near- term margin pressure. In this context, we think Rajhi and SNB exhibit the greatest resilience: i) they have lower exposure to the corporate loan growth theme given a lower corporate loan tilt, along with a reduction in loan exposure to riskier sectors, and ii) they stand to benefit the most from retail loan growth accelerating on potential rate cuts improving affordability, and mortgage growth picking up on new regulations. Amongst corporate banks, we continue to like, SAB, Riyad and ANB, though these are mainly driven by valuation given deep discounts to history.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
