If these months sales had been reversed (adding ~25k units to 1H 25), then we believe that the recent small margin guidance cut could have been avoided - although negative EU pricing remains a headwind. Either way, given very low expectations, and consensual positioning, these figures were enough to give the shorts a scare pushing the shares up ~5%.

Citi strategy published on French political risks today -European Multi-Asset: French Political Risks on the Rise Again.

      "text": "Is Renault more solid than investors believe? — For many OEMs, investors continue to focus on historical and narrow narratives. Whilst Renault's core European brand is arguably most vulnerable to EU price declines and China competition, this is not true for the key profit drivers of Renault Group – 1 – DACIA; 2 – LCV; 3 – Mobilize. We believe that DACIA generates \\(\\sim \\epsilon 1bn\\) EBIT p.a; we believe that LCV generates \\(\\sim \\epsilon 0.8bn\\) EBIT in a normal year (not in FY25); and Mobilize generates a very stable \\(\\sim \\epsilon 1.4bn\\) EBIT p.a. This adds up to approx \\(\\sim \\epsilon 3bn\\) Renault Group EBIT p.a., or \\(\\sim \\epsilon 7.00\\) EPS at a \\(20\\%\\) tax rate. Over and above that Renault brand PV business likely remains profitable for now, but more cyclical. On top of this, Renault has sharply reduced fixed costs with the HORSE merger of all its engine/transmission factories, and Renault's Ampere BEV entity is close to breaking even for the first time with all the new BEV model launches. This \"more resilient\" Renault thesis is what the new Renault management now needs to evidence. Obviously, Renault's recent much improved FCF resilience will depend on such EBIT resilience.",

Remains Buy, but we reduce our TP to €42 (from €44) on marginally lower mid- term EBIT margin expectations in a more difficult European car market environment. We hope that Renault can outperform its historical margin cyclicality given the new product range and cost restructuring previous management achieved, but this remains to be evidenced by the company by achieving new 2H 25 guidance. The impact of Nissan exceptional losses on FY25 Renault EPS has not helped – the change to investment accounting for Nissan will remove this going forward. Whilst almost all OEMs offer low valuations, including Renault, we prefer VW as a restructuring play and P911 as a better quality restructuring / recovery play into FY26E.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.

The securities of non- U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for exact dividend computations. Investors who have received the Product from the Firm may be prohibited in certain states or other jurisdictions from purchasing securities mentioned in the Product from the Firm. Please ask your Financial Consultant for additional details. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. takes responsibility for the Product in the United States.
