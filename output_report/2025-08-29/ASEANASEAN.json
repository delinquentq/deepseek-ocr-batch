By product category, export performance was a mixed bag, with manufactured goods (e.g., tech and autos) outperforming agricultural goods. By trading destination, we see that frontloading to the US has largely petered out, while the sharp increase in exports to China in 2Q25 has continued to be reversed (Figure 3).

We take a more sanguine view of this matter. Setting aside the temporary nature of the import suspension, domestic rice stocks (Figure 5) are ample to meet demand. Based on FAO's projections (Figure 6), we estimate that the shortfall caused by a two- month import suspension is around 690k metric tons. \\(65\\%\\) of that shortfall can be covered by the National Food Authority (NFA)'s inventories (450k), while the other \\(35\\%\\) can be met by private sector inventories, with the enforcement of the Anti- Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act (signed into law in September 2024) working to stamp out hoarding/profiteering behavior.
