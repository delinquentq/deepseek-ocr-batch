Fitch will be the first to review French sovereign rating on 12 September (current rating AA- negative outlook). Fitch had put France on negative outlook in October 2024. In their last rating review in March 2025, Fitch had forecast French deficit for 2026 at 5.6% and for 2027 at 5.4%. Also, in their recent commentary post the French 2026 draft proposal from the Bayrou government in July 2025, Fitch highlighted that the proposed budget (2026 deficit projected at 4.6% by the government) could improve fiscal outturns but given political constraints the government will find it hard to approve the proposal in full. Our base case is for no rating action from Fitch at the review, as by 12 September, it is unlikely to have much clarity on political/budget process and Fitch will likely want to see the final political/budget outcome before making a decision on a rating downgrade. A rating downgrade from AA- to A+ will be a modest surprise for the market, in our view, and would likely lead to some modest knee- jerk widening in French spreads (around 5bp in 10Y spread). For instance, Belgian spreads underperformed by around 4bp vs. core peers post the Fitch down",

Our baseline is for ECB to deliver one final cut in October, although the bar for an ease is high.

Third, even though growth data has been better- than- expected, it has not overshot staff projections so far. It is likely that current ECB rhetoric embeds some tolerance for inflation prints undershooting the \\(2\\%\\) target and that bar for an expected October is also high and will likely require further weakening in both growth and inflation data. Nevertheless, we also believe that market pricing around 3bp of easing for October is too low. We expect the ECB to stay on hold in September but not fully shut the door for an October cut. Thus, risk- reward for receiving Oct25 ECB ESTR is high with asymmetric upside, in our view. Overall, we recommend tactically receiving Oct25 ECB ESTR at \\(1.895\\%\\) (see Trade Recommendations).",

While the upside to receiving is limited, we believe that this offers asymmetric upside from current levels, as the ESTR curve is only pricing a cumulative easing of around 20bp by mid- 2026. With the ECB still maintaining an easing bias, we believe that the market will continue to price some easing which is likely to increase if output were to start to weaken or inflation prints over the coming months are more benign than ECB's forecast.

For instance, Dutch pension funds typically announce indexation of pension payouts based on the September inflation print. With Dutch inflation still above \\(2\\%\\) , we expect these funds to announce further increase in payouts this year. Historically, these funds then typically receive in long- end swaps (a 10s/30s flattener) to lock coverage ratios. A repeat of this dynamic could exert some flattening pressure on the curve. Of course, there exists a nontrivial chance that, due to already high policy funding ratios and high interest rate hedge exposures, indexation- based receiving could be smaller than seen previously. Nevertheless, this remains a risk to medium- term steepeners. Empirically, the 10s/30s curve tends to flatten a few bps over the month of September (Figure 47).",

In our view, the limited volatility of German swap spreads potentially embeds this expectation of limited volatility in French spreads. Nevertheless, in the event of a large widening of French spreads, we would expect German swap spreads to widen as well, despite limited correlation currently. In Figure 52, we show the betas of various German swap spreads versus 10Y OAT/Bund spreads during past episodes of sharp widening in French spreads. While the relationship is currently broadly non- existent, historically, German swap spreads tend to exhibit a decent beta (and R- squared) to French spreads during these two episodes. For instance, Schatz spreads moved with a beta of around 50% to French spreads during the sharp widening seen in June 2024 when Macron surprisingly announced the parliamentary elections. Admittedly, the reaction of German swap spreads this time around has been rather muted but we believe that Schatz swap spread widener still offers a good hedge against a tail risk of significant widening in French spreads.",

Implieds are optically cheap on valuations but we expect implieds to remain sticky around current levels. However, we continue to stay short volatility, especially via structures that exploit mean reversion in front- end yields (Figure 61). Admittedly, we have a bullish duration bias (see above) but we highlight that we do not expect front- end yields to decline materially from current levels and range trading remains a strong conviction theme. The bar for ECB to cut policy rates further is high and it will require proof of data which is likely to be gradual over the coming weeks, as is reflected in our baseline scenario of a final cut coming only in October. In other words, even though implied volatility is likely to remain sticky, we do expect delivered volatility to stay muted over the coming weeks. To this effect, we highlight the following attractive strategies.",

For instance, buying ATMF 1Yx5Y straddles versus selling an equi- notional amount of ATMF 6Mx5Y straddles are long vega/short gamma at inception by construction. The weighted implied volatility spread (weighted by vega to obtain equi- notional exposure) exhibits a strong positive correlation to implieds but with a small beta (Figure 63). The weighted vol spread is close to the low end of its recent range and appears marginally too cheap versus implies. On the curve, we prefer these structures in the 5Y sector where we expect delivered volatility to be relatively muted as ECB is expected to remain on the sidelines over the next few weeks. The main risk to this trade would come from a jump in risk- off sentiment which could lead to some flattening of the expiry curve and/or large yield moves. Overall, we recommend buying 1Yx5Y ATMF straddles versus selling an equi- notional amount of 6Mx5Y ATMF straddles (see Trade Recommendations).",

As we have discussed previously, these synthetic replicates have residual gamma and vega exposures even though standard forward volatility agreements (FVA) have zero gamma exposure. In Figure 64, we present a list of attractive synthetic volatility constructs that are overall short gamma/long vega at inception. We also highlight that short FVAs are short correlation by construction. Correlation between the front and intermediate yields (say 1Yx1Y vs 5Yx5Y) is around \\(60\\%\\) when measured on daily changes over the past 3M. However, with front- end yields expected to remain sticky, we believe that risk bias for the correlation to stay low or decline even further. Amongst the structures presented, we favour shorts in 6Mx1Yx5Y which can be constructed via selling 6Mx1Y and 18Mx5Y straddles versus buying 6Mx6Y straddles, which appears attractive.",

Tighter fiscal policy at the Autumn budget would likely pose downside growth risks into 2026, but given the OBR needs 10 weeks to prepare forecasts and with no budget date announced yet, it is more likely that an Autumn budget will be delivered after the November \\(6^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) MPC meeting.

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this security because of either legal, regulatory or policy reasons or because of lack of a sufficient fundamental basis. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. Recommendations will be at the issuer level, and an issuer recommendation applies to all of the index- eligible bonds at the same level for the issuer. When we change the issuer- level rating, we are changing the rating for all of the issues covered, unless otherwise specified.
