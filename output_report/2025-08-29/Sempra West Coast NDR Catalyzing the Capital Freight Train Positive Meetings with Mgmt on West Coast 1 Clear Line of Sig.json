Street and Barclays EPS estimates are roughly in line with this view, though as mgmt continues to execute this year, and gives an updated view of SIP accretion in 3Q/4Q, there could be a path for consensus EPS revisions in the back half of this year. Longer term on the growth rate we see mgmt as remaining conservative but setting the story up to consistently outperform the high end of the 7- 9% long term EPS expectations, and it does appear mgmt will work to provide a new plan in early 2026, which should show another increase in long term CapEx, which depending on the outcome of the SIP sale, may not require ongoing common equity issuance. The new plan could come in the form of a higher 26 / 2 base EPS in our view that mgmt then grows off of at a 7- 9% rate. A common question after the 4Q rebase was when does mgmt's new growth rate outlook intersect with the old plan where mgmt does seem well positioned to exceed expectations.",

      "text": "Oncor Rate Case: Interim Rates Underappreciated... Watching PUCT Approval: Recall Oncor filed its electric rate case back in late June, requesting an increase in revenue requirement of \\(\\) 834\\mathrm{mm}\\(, predicated on 10.55% ROE and 45% equity layer, compared with the last approved rate case back in early 2023, with authorized ROE of 9.7% and equity layer of 42.5%. On August 12, as part of the agreed procedural schedule, Oncor agrees to waive the 12/29/2025 statutory deadline for the commission to issue a final order, with parties agreeing to an interim rate (D&A, Cost of Debt, Storm Cost recoveries), and a new targeted PFD was set for 3/3/2026. Parties (including Staff and most of the intervenors, including large industrials) agreed on Oncor's existing rates becoming interim rates effective 1/1/2026, and being subject to refund or surcharge based upon the final rates approved by the Commission. We expect the commission to approve this structure for interim rates in the next few weeks, while this changes the set up for a settlement in our view into year end. The current procedural schedule includes intervenor direct testimony on 10/17, staff direct testimony on 10/24, with hearings to start on 11/17 through 11/21. The agreement on interim rates is a fundamental change in Texas which we think puts the company in a better negotiating position through the case, and takes the risk off there being rate lag starting in Jan 1, 2026, while Oncor we think could still settle on ROE / capital structure by year end. We note our current model assumes a 9.7% ROE / 43.5% equity layer, and every 100bps of equity capital structure movement translates to \\(0.05 / sh\\) of EPS, or 1% of consolidated SRE EPS. We do sense from our trip there is clear upside to Texas capital structure over time, perhaps beyond our 43.5% assumption.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
