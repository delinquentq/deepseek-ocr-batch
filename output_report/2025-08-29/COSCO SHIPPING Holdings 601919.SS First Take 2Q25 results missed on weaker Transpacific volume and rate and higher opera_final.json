The company reported a net profit of Rmb17.5bn in 1H25, which implies 2Q25 net profit of Rmb 5.8bn (- 42% YoY/- 50% QoQ), missing the market expectation. For context, if subsidiary OOCL (0316. HK, 71% held by COSCO's 1H25 net profit of USD954mn on Aug 21 (implying attributable profit of Rmb4.9bn for COSCO), as OOCL's profit contribution historically accounted for \\(\\sim 26\\%\\) of COSCO's net profit, it would imply net profit of Rmb7bn. We attribute this miss to a weaker- than- expected restocking volume and freight rate on Transpacific routes from mid- June, and higher operating cost aroused from lifted port charges (incl. storage charges) at European terminals amid port congestion and more depreciation from sizable vessel delivery. The company has declared an interim DPS of Rmb0.56 based on unchanged payout of 49%, implying 8%/7% annualized dividend yield for H/A- shares respectively.",

We see current valuation as fair given shares are trading similar to historical cycle level when port congestion was approaching its peak.
