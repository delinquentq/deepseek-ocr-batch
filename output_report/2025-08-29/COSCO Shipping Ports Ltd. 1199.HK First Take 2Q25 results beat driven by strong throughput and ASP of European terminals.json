This also implies 2Q25 net profit of US \\(898mn (+28\\% \\text{YoY} / + 17\\% \\text{QoQ})\\) , vs. 1Q25 net profit of US \\(84mn (+33\\% \\text{YoY} / - 4\\% \\text{QoQ})\\) , despite a disruption on port throughput from tariff escalation since April. We attribute this strong result mainly to its overseas business, with Piraeus terminal achieving higher storage income and throughput recovery, and CSP Spain and CSP Zeebrugge achieving higher throughput amid alliance reshuffling. The company declared an interim dividend of HK15.1 cents on an unchanged payout ratio of \\(40\\%\\) , which implies \\(5.5\\%\\) annualized dividend yield. Key takeaways include: 1) The profit growth was largely driven by overseas terminals improving to US \\(57mn (+187\\% \\text{YoY})\\) in 1H25, while China terminals recorded largely stable results (+1% YoY); 2) For 2025 throughput guidance, the company took reference to Drewry's FY25 global throughput guidance of \\(+1.9\\%\\) YoY, which implies a decline by - \\(0.8\\%\\) YoY in 3Q25 on destocking, while in 4Q25 expects to see further sequential decline; 3) European subsidiaries terminal ASP continue to maintain \\(+10\\%\\) YoY (in local currencies), which management attributed to higher tariff negotiated with shipping lines, storage income and box mix change.",
