Average hourly earnings (AHE) growth likely just rounded down to \\(0.3\\%\\) m- o- m. Risks are skewed towards a higher print due to a positive calendar effect in August. The labor market is losing momentum, and shifting balance of risks to the Fed's dual mandate is likely to lead to a 25bp cut at the September meeting. Contained layoffs and few signs of acute labor market stress are likely to limit aggressive easing though.",

      "text": "Malaysia: We expect BNM to leave its overnight policy rate unchanged at \\(2.75\\%\\) after the \"pre- emptive\" 25bp cut at its previous MPC meeting. We think BNM remains optimistic on the near- term growth outlook and the resilience of domestic demand, despite acknowledging risks from tariff- related uncertainty. BNM recently revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast to a still- decent \\(4.0 - 4.8\\%\\) (Nomura: \\(4.4\\%\\) ), and the modified reciprocal tariff of \\(19\\%\\) , according to BNM, is within its assumptions. We think the tone of the policy statement should be relatively neutral and BNM will still likely signal a data- dependent approach. BNM Governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour, who said previously that BNM is not on a pre- set course, continues to describe the economy as remaining on a \"solid footing\" in the Q2 bulletin. We also expect BNM to remain comfortable with the inflation outlook, likely citing the limited impact of the government's fiscal consolidation measures. On FX, we think BNM will maintain its stance, reiterating that the currency's performance is driven by external factors and supported by strong fundamentals and its ongoing initiatives.",

Final data clues to be released over the next few days might impact our final tracking. Data released to date suggest respectable growth in private demand, with solid growth in consumer spending, weak growth in dwelling investment and modest growth in spending on plant and equipment investment. We also expect positive growth in government spending, and a positive contribution from net exports, with export volumes outpacing imports. Australian commodity prices fell around \\(5\\%\\) q- o- q in Q2, and we expect this to weigh on the terms of trade (down around \\(3\\%\\) q- o- q), company profits and income growth. Our forecast implies modest but positive growth in GDP per capita and GDP per hour worked, with population and hours worked both rising by around \\(0.4\\%\\) q- o- q in Q2.",

Other measures used to gauge underlying trends, however, are likely to remain relatively steady with daily average export growth moderating to \\(4.8\\%\\) y- o- y in August from \\(5.9\\%\\) in July. Furthermore, after adjusting for seasonality, the three- month change in exports, which may reflect underlying chip export growth more accurately, likely picked up to \\(3.1\\%\\) sa in August from \\(1.3\\%\\) sa in July. Thus, despite our forecast for a likely sharp decline in August export growth, we expect modest gains in exports in the coming months.
