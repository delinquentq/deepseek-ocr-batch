Earnings have reached a growth trajectory, thanks to largescale restructuring from 2009 and to the bolstering of the firm's IT services, power grid, and railway businesses. Going forward, Hitachi plans to pursue growth by expanding sales via a fusion of its IT services business like Lumada and Hmax, which use Al, and its social infrastructure businesses like power grids and railways. We believe management's focus on RolC improvement as well as profit growth will lead to a rise in share price valuations. We forecast a steady improvement in RolC, driven by organic growth in mainstay businesses and proactive shareholder returns. We also anticipate sales of non- core businesses and boltof M&A that result in step- changes to profits and invested capital, and think the improvement in RolC will be sustained as the firm splits off low- margin businesses and conducts M&A that does not excessively push up invested capital.",

On the other hand, if these factors turned out to be more favorable than we anticipate, earnings could overshoot and the share price could exceed our target price.

      "text": "Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return (\"ETR\") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"-\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",
