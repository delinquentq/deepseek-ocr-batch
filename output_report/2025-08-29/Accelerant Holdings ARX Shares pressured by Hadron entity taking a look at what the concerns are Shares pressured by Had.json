Hadron is sponsored by ARX's private equity sponsor, Altamont Capital and was discussed on ARX's 2Q25 earnings call.

Hadron is a fronting carrier established in 2023 that is sponsored by Altamont capital, ARX's private equity sponsor. Fronting carriers use their insurance companies to write insurance policies for the purpose of passing on insurance risk (premiums) to third parties for a fee, and ARX appears to be Hadron's sole insurance risk provider to date based on insurance regulatory filings. We think that Hadron and the implications of Hadron on third party insurer growth were the primary reason the stock underperformed following the results in the quarter.

Said another way, the member Managing General Agents (MGAs, the underwriters on the exchange) would likely still have been able to win the business and underwrite the premium. Without Hadron the GPW would have likely just gone through Accelerant underwriting in most cases, which comes with capital requirements and would have made the third party insurer penetration of exchange 11% YTD instead of 23%.",

This comes with capital requirements and associated revenue (fronting fee) for the underwriting segment, which is lower margin. Excluding Hadron GPW and GPW that is reinsured back through ARX (both could be argued to be lower quality third party insurer relationships), we estimate that ARX third party insurer premium was only 2- 3% in 2024, versus 16% total third party insurer premium.
