The company maintained guidance at Cigar Lake, but did note potential upside production risks of 1 mln lbs given strong YTD performance. Kazatomprom also pointed to lower 2026 output earlier this week, from 32,777 tU (85 mln lbs U308) to 29,697tU, - 8 mln lbs, mainly from its JV Budenovskoye. These cuts come against an already- tight balance. Putting in Cameco's guidance would increase our 2025 deficit from 10 to 14 mln lbs.",

While this buying is likely to stop once the funds are used up (we estimate it was enough to buy 2.6 - 3mln lbs depending on the uranium price), other buying may emerge. Producers often contract a large proportion of their sales, meaning they can be forced to turn to the spot market or run down inventories to maintain deliveries if they run into production issues. At its Q2 results, Cameco reported inventory of 7.6 mln lbs U308 equivalently, down from 11 mln lbs at 31 Dec 2024. Paladin (covered by Rahul Anand) noted on its 28 Aug earnings that there was an RFP for 9 mln lbs from Korea in the market, noting that the country had not filled any volumes over the last two years, and expected them to come for additional volumes this year, as well as other parties, particularly in Europe \"with large unfilled volumes that need to be filled later this year\".",
