      "text": "Silergy's 2Q25 GM missed our estimates due to a one- off supply disruption, despite stable pricing conditions, and management expects a normalization in 2H25E. Silergy finally admitted to 2025E revenue falling short of its \\(20 - 30\\%\\) y- y growth target (in USD terms; we have flagged below- guidance growth since January), but attributed the weakness to its higher North American \"end- customer\" exposure in the consumer and computing verticals whose production plans are affected by tariff policy uncertainty. Although China demand market commentary sounds more encouraging, we are skeptical about Silergy's execution to \"recoup share in the consumer end- market\", as its Chinese competitors have broadly reported solid revenue growth with demand strength across the board. We understand that the trend of Chinese downstream embracing more indigenous analog IC supplies is intact, and that Silergy is actively expanding design win footprints overseas (automobile and data centers), but a slower design win pipeline to revenue conversion actually shakes our conviction on Silergy's greater growth cycle into 2026F (Analog Anchor & Auto Anchor). We lower our already below- consensus 2025F revenue growth to \\(+6\\%\\) y- y (in USD terms) and reduce 2026F to \\(+21\\%\\) y- y (at the low end of the revenue CAGR guidance) factoring in execution uncertainty. We adjust our opex assumptions and cut 2025F- 27F EPS by 14- 19%. Our new TP of TWD430 is based on 40x (unchanged) 2026F EPS of TWD10.75. With the stock trailing the TAIEX 29% YTD likely pricing in slower pipeline conversion, we keep our Buy rating on Silergy for the secular growth catalysts. The stock trades at a 30x 2026F P/E.",

      "text": "(1) Demand: Silergy is gaining shares in design wins, but customers are delaying the product ramp-up schedule due to tariff uncertainty. (2) Pricing and profitability: Pricing environment is benign. Silergy does not plan for any price hikes as share gain is the primary objective. With the ramp-up of its new product platform, an optimized cost structure could help with product marketing. (3) Automotive: Silergy can address USD150 per year currently, with ~USD300 expected in 2026E. It continues to broaden its product matrix, with BMS and RISC-V MCU rolled out this year, to position itself as a system solution provider amidst competition. (4) AI servers: It could take, at least, three years from design wins to revenue contribution. Silergy highlighted it has made some progress in ASIC AI servers overseas and domestically.",

Renewables and AI data center (servers, optical module and storage) are likely to witness better growth in 2H25E. Automotive demand should be up h-h in 2H25E.- Expects 3Q25E revenue to be flat to up slightly q-q, based on past seasonality.- The market looks to be softer than expected, and hence it could be challenging for Silergy to deliver 20-30% y-y revenue growth this year. The softness comes from demand shortfall and uncertainty from tariff policies as customers are more reserved with production plans.- Silergy still looks for growth in 2025E, but demand uncertainty blurs visibility on growth prospects this year. The company is, thus, building up inventories in response to any potential rush orders.- Some customers (Chinese and non-Chinese) have higher exposures to North America end-markets (primarily, consumer and computing [e.g., NB and monitors]), and the actual production plans are much lower than prior forecasts (made at the beginning of the year). Those customers have also reduced inventory levels on hand.- Silergy is gaining shares in design wins, however, customers are delaying the product ramp-up schedule due to tariff uncertainty. The chairman is confident of converting the design wins to revenue going forward, especially in servers and automobile.- Expects China and non-China revenue split to be \\~60-40 for the full year.- Silergy needs to evaluate how it could improve its grasp of short-run dynamics. Also, it began considering fab capacity planning and supply chain management after the chip shortage in prior years which had resulted in a slower ramp up of Gen 3 and Gen 4 products, and therefore it aims to be better prepared for Gen 5 products.- Based on the current design win pipeline, Silergy is confident to deliver 20-30% revenue growth in 2026E, however, the key is whether the sales team could work toward converting the pipeline to revenue.- Data center SSDs are in shortage, while client SSD demand is subject to brand names — some are in shortage and some are in low demand.- Management believes it is possible for Silergy to generate USD2bn+ annual revenue in the future, considering the expansion in addressable markets and clientele.",

The impact was a result of production shift from China to outside China, as well as some legacy products returning to previous factories for production. Less FX impact (from TWD appreciation) on 2Q25 GM as USD is the functional currency. Management is confident that GM could rebound to \\(53 - 54\\%\\) in 2H25E. The company does not plan for any price hike as share gain is the primary objective. With the ramp- up of new product platform, an optimized cost structure could help with product marketing. If Silergy does not refresh its legacy products (e.g., Gen 2), it could lose some shares in the field. Moreover, if the company finds growth in a sub- category, it could bring the legacy product to a newer platform to follow with the demand trend. Silergy's supply chain is mainly in China. The capacity plans in recent years are to move from \\(8^{\\circ}\\) fabs to \\(12^{\\circ}\\) fabs with better cost structure. Silergy is ramping up Gen 4, and will potentially bring Gen 5 to production in 2026. Gen 5 platform has fab partners in China and overseas, and the latter's ramp up will come later. Capacity allocation mix depends on the demand mix, and the capacity from dual supply tracks is sufficient to underpin upcoming growth profile. Management expects models open to be nearly flat q- q over the next four quarters. Automotive could make up \\(- 50\\%\\) of R&D each year, while Al (motherboard, PSU, storage, and optical module) could form \\(- 25\\%\\) of R&D. Consumer, industrial and NB share the remaining R&D resources. Most of Gen 4 ramp- up could have taken place in 2H25, but given demand uncertainty and delayed customer ramp up, the \\(10\\%\\) mix of Gen 4 products could be deferred by 1- 2 quarters.",

Silergy plans to bring in more capacity to unfold growth and also executes on dual supply chain strategy. In China, it has built a domestic supply chain with Gen 4 production platform (on 12\" fabs) for design-ins, for customers with more capacity access and better cost/performance vs. Gen 3.

As far as AMD AI servers are concerned, there is not much significant progress that Silergy could share.- The company has also secured some design wins at Chinese CSPs. Existing products have design wins, and Silergy is also rolling out new products to address more opportunities and dollar contents.- Silergy's AI server revenue could reach 5% of mix next year.- AI is similar to industrial clients with high reliability requirement, and it could take at least three years from design wins to revenue contribution. Silergy has started increasing R&D resource allocation to AI from early 2024, after years of investments.",
