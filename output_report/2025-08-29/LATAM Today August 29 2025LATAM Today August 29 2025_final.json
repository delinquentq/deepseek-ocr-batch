The stock of gross general government debt as a share of GDP is tracking at \\(77.6\\%\\) ( \\(+100\\) bp from June; \\(89.9\\%\\) of GDP according to the IMF standard definition) and is expected to continue to climb. A pro- cyclical fiscal stance and the reluctance to control spending severely undermined the credibility of the fiscal targets and contributed to an over- heated economy. Furthermore, a weak and unreliable fiscal anchor increased fiscal risk- premia, leading to unanchored short- and medium- term inflation expectations.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
