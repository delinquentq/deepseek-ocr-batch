While RF content growth is minimal, longer test durations, potential tariff exemptions, and eSIM adoption could support volumes, driving an expected \\(6\\%\\) FY26E RF growth. Memory segment ramp faces delays due to customer component shortages, though the optoelectronics segment is experiencing strong growth from 800G transceivers, with FY26 revenue forecast to rise \\(35\\%\\) Y/Y. Separately, Inari and San'an acquisition of Lumileds may be able to scale INARI's revenue but at dilutive margins. Investors remain concerned about integration challenges given Lumileds' weak financials. We lower our FY26/27E forecast and extend our PT period to Jun- 26 with a higher price target of RM2.20, based on \\(27x\\) 12M fwd EPS (at 5- year mean). Stay Neutral.",

Coming off a seasonally weak June quarter (4QFY25), management guided for an uptick in RF testing utilization as its key customer ramps for the iPhone 17 launch. While RF content growth remains limited, management highlighted slightly longer test durations requested by the customer due to minor design tweaks. On the positive side, we think shipment volumes could be supported by (i) potential tariff exemptions given Apple's sizable US investments, and (ii) the expected removal of the eSIM ban in China, which would benefit demand for the iPhone Slim, as the model only supports eSIM. We factor in \\(6\\%\\) growth for the RF segment in FY26E (USD terms), underpinned by stronger- than- expected shipments in the Sep/Dec qtrs. (link).",

Management attributed the delay to component shortages on the customer side, despite the group already being qualified for high- volume production (estimated RM100mn revenue/year). This could push back the ramp originally scheduled for 1QFY26. On a brighter note, the optoelectronics segment delivered meaningful growth in 4QFY25, supported by progress in the optical transceiver business. The Philippines plant (CK2.1) saw growing demand for 800G module production as more data centers migrated from lower- end modules. Additionally, Malaysian production is expected to double in 1QFY26. We forecast \\(35\\%\\) Y/Y growth for the optoelectronics segment in FY26.",
