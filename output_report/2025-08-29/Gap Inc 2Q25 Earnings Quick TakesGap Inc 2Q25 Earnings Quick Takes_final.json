More specifically, while GAP's topline narrative was mostly unchanged from recent trend in the quarter - with three of four brands continuing their consistent, positive comp trajectories as brand reinvigoration efforts shine - GM underperformance vs. consensus & mgmt. guidance stood out to the downside (41.2% vs. Street 41.9% & guidance \\(\\sim 41.8\\%\\) ). This below- expectations GM outcome stemmed from unexpected incremental promotional actions to support the Athleta reset, where 1) comps fell - 9% - similar to 1Q, despite an easier q/q compare, & 2) mgmt. has appointed the leadership. This result likely fuels bears' fears that there's limited GM expansion ahead for GAP, though mgmt.'s underlying FY GM commentary (ex- tariffs) was constructive (more below).
