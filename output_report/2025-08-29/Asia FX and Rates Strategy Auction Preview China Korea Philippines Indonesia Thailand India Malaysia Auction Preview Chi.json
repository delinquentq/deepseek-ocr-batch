Overall CGB supply this year has exhibited a notably front- loaded profile, with \\(75\\%\\) of the RMB 13.9tn quota already utilized, compared to a historical average of \\(60\\%\\) over the preceding three years. On the front of ultra- long tenor special CGB issuance, YTD issuance by the end of Aug'25 has reached RMB 1tn, roughly \\(77\\%\\) of RMB 1.3tn target quota. With five ultra- long tenor special CGB issuances left to be issued until early Oct, CGB supply pressure is set to moderate in 4Q. On the recent demand dynamics, we note that the bid- to- cover on the most recent 10y CGB issuance dropped significantly to 2.58, marking the new low over its 12m range.",

To recap, The MoF and State administration of Taxation announced that value- added tax (VAT) will be reinstated on interest income from government bonds, local government bonds, and financial bonds issued from Aug \\(8^{\\text{th}}\\) onwards; bonds issued before August \\(8^{\\text{th}}\\) will retain their VAT- exempt status until maturity. Additionally, for the reopening issuance of bonds originally issued before Aug \\(8^{\\text{th}}\\) , VAT exemption will remain applicable until maturity date of the bonds. Overall, we believe there is some rotation of money happening between bonds and equities both onshore as well as offshore which is pushing yields higher. However, unless we see a big move higher in inflation, the bias would be to re- engage in long 10y CGB at around \\(2\\%\\) levels. Meanwhile, we remain long in 1y NCD with FX hedge (entry: 2.01%, current 1.61% as of 15:01pm HKT Aug 29th 2025).",

KTB issuance target is set at KRW 232tn for 2026, vs. this year's KRW 231.1tn (after the second supplementary budget), and original budget of KRW 197.6tn. Net issuance is expected to reach KRW 115.7tn in 2026, increased by KRW 2.1tn from this year. Additionally, the government will have quasi- sovereign issuances up to KRW 40tn, including KRW 15tn Advanced Strategic Industry Fund Bonds, KRW 10tn won Supply Chain Stabilization Fund Bonds, and KRW 13.7tn KRW- denominated FX stabilization Bonds. Accordingly, fiscal deficit ratio is expected to reach \\(4\\%\\) of GDP, effectively nullifying the fiscal rule pursued by the Yoon Suk- yeol administration that capped the ratio at \\(3.0\\%\\) , as noted by our economist (link).",

The rate hold decision this week resonates with our view that monetary policy is likely to take a backseat for now even though housing prices have continued to come off. However, we uphold the view that the BOK is still in a rate cutting cycle. The rate hold decision this week have further raised the chances for a 25bp cut to materialize in the next few months, in our view. It is also likely that we get something more but for that to happen we would need concrete signs of economic slowdown (despite a more active fiscal policy) and softer inflation prints on a sustainable basis.

Any decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus. Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. Statements and views concerning ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors are typically based upon public statements made by the affected company or other public news, which the author may not have independently verified. ESG factors are one consideration that investors may choose to examine when making investment decisions.

Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instituted in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",
