This would be a busy month but no more so than we have seen in the past, given the €82bn placed in September 2024 for example. Though the risks to our September issuance expectations are skewed to the upside while spreads remain at the tighter end of the range, we do not think supply should pose a problem for the market in general. Volumes are manageable and the market has been digesting supply pretty well, as evidenced by the lack of new issue concession (Figure 2). In our view, the flurry of supply that follows the quieter summer period is well known and should not cause sustained pressure.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
