Today's 2Q GDP report delivered on expectations for further evidence of a weaker economy, with overall activity contracting \\(1.6\\% \\mathrm{q} / \\mathrm{q}\\) , saar. The boost from the front- loading of exports to get ahead of tariffs, which kept overall activity robust at the start of the year, reversed sharply in 2Q and business fixed investment contracted amidst persistent uncertainty over trade policy. Both exports and business equipment investment posted the steepest declines of the post- pandemic period last quarter.",

A strong rebound in household consumption, which expanded \\(4.5\\%\\) ar in 2Q, suggests the trade war's impact hadn't fully permeated the broader economy last quarter (Figure 1). While we believe that some of this apparent strength is attributable to the tail- end of front- loaded spending ahead of anticipated tariff- related price hikes, the pickup in spending was evenly distributed between goods and services in 2Q. The Bank of Canada's Survey on Business Conditions for 3Q released earlier this week suggests that a large share of firms have been delaying passing on tariff costs to consumers.",
