This weaker- than- expected print marks the end of the above- trend growth trajectory observed over the past five quarters, as the boost from front- loading behavior ahead of tariffs, which had kept overall activity robust at the start of the year, sharply reversed in 2Q. While a strong rebound in household consumption suggests the trade war's impact hadn't fully permeated the broader economy last quarter, more timely labor market data are hinting at weakness spreading beyond sectors directly exposed to the trade conflict.

The Bank of Canada's Survey on Business Conditions for 3Q released earlier this week suggests that a large share of firms have been delaying passing on tariff costs to consumers. While confirmation of weak 2Q growth alone is unlikely to sway the Bank of Canada in favor of resuming rate cuts at its meeting next month, the Bank has signaled that it would consider cutting rates if the economy continues to show signs of weakness and upward price pressures from trade disruptions remain contained. In our view, a weak August Labour Force Survey and stable core CPI in August could be sufficient to tilt the balance in favor of a rate cut on September 17.",
