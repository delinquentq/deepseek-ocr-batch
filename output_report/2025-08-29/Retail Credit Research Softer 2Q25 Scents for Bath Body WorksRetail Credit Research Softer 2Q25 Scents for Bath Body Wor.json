Management quantified tariff headwinds and now expects an\\) \\ \\(85m\\) mn impact in FY25 (with \\(\\) 40m\\(in 3Q,\\) \\ \\(29m\\) in 4Q), but left FY guidance mostly unchanged / narrowed within prior ranges, in - line with comments made in 1Q that they are well positioned to absorb tariffs at current levels (hence unchanged guidance in 1Q post- liberation day).
