Our channel checks suggest this was met with limited resistance as seasonally better demand, ongoing hardwood gains vs. softwood, anti- involution discussions in China and Suzano's production cut announcement have helped sentiment. However, the softwood market remains weak (despite global profitability pressure) and China paper prices have been either flat (tissue) to down (graphics and paperboard). The latter is mainly explained by ongoing supply growth and expectation of production resumption by Chemning (who have been down since late 2024 and have recently managed to raise debt to resume operations).",

Suzano have announced a second round of price increase, which is likely to meet larger resistance from buyers unless the paper market manage to recover profitability via price increase (it's proving incrementally more challenging due to oversupply). On the positive side, seasonality is likely to be positive in September and October which should play in favor of pulp sellers. But a more sustainable pulp price momentum is dependent on supply cuts.",
