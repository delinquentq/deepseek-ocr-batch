      "text": "- The Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) reported that Malaysia attracted MYR100.6bn of approved investments in Q2, up from MYR89.8bn in Q1, despite rising external uncertainty. This brings the H1 total to MYR190.3bn, rising 18.7% y-o-y, driven by both the services and manufacturing sectors. In particular, foreign investments (56.1% of total approvals) surged 43.5% y-o-y to MYR106.8bn in H1, led by services (100.7% y-o-y).- By state, Johor was the largest driver, attracting MYR56.0bn of approved investments in H1, according to the MIDA, which is more than four times the MYR13bn in H1 2024. This was likely driven by the launch of the JS-SEZ in January, thanks to initiatives to expedite the approval process and incentives to attract investors.- This supports our long-held view of sustained investment spending growth, underpinned by the implementation of economic reforms, including recently the 13MP, which would help to counter external risks. As such, we think potential growth is rising over the next few years.- We maintain our GDP growth forecast of 4.4% for 2025, at the midpoint of BNM's revised forecast range of 4.0-4.8% (Consensus: 4.1%).",
