Tertiary amines, intermediates in surfactant production, are made from vegetable oil via fatty alcohol. According to Kao, it currently holds a \\(35\\%\\) global market share thanks to its proprietary catalyst technology, which enables highly efficient manufacturing. With the opening of this new facility, Kao will have tertiary amine production bases in Japan, the Philippines, Germany, and the Americas, thus establishing a three- region manufacturing network across Asia, Europe, and the Americas.",

Tertiary amines are intermediates for cationic surfactants, which are known for their adsorption to fibers, antistatic effects and antibacterial properties. As reported by Nikkei on Aug 24, they are widely used in products such as dishwashing detergents, disinfectants, hair conditioners, and rust inhibitors. While alcohol is commonly used in disinfectants, high concentrations increase packaging and transport costs and restrict consumer use, such as on airplanes. Kao explains that its \"Biore u Hand Sanitizer\" achieves high bactericidal performance using cationic components derived from tertiary amines, rather than relying on high- concentration alcohol.",
