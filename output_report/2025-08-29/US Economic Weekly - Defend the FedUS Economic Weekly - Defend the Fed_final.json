This number likely underestimated the \"true\" value of de minimis imports and the impact of de minimis tariffs will likely be larger than the CBP estimate implies. The impact of suspension of de minimis tariff exemptions seems to be heavily concentrated in e- commerce. We will likely see more tariff revenues, but slower goods spending and higher goods prices. In particular, we could see some notable price pressures on apparel prices as the share of apparel products in total e- commerce sales is high.",

Average hourly earnings (AHE) growth likely just rounded down to \\(0.3\\%\\) m- o- m. Risks are skewed towards a higher print due to a positive calendar effect in August. The labor market is losing momentum, and shifting balance of risks to the Fed's dual mandate is likely to lead to a 25bp cut at the September meeting. Contained layoffs and few signs of acute labor market stress are likely to limit aggressive easing though.",

Data since the June FOMC meeting have demonstrated a sharp deterioration in employment data and less inflation pressure than feared.
