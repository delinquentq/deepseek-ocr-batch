We provide a regular update on the evolution of developed market (DM) rates markets in the recent past. Considering the uncertainty surrounding trade and fiscal policy, we begin by comparing budget balances and current account balances across major DM countries. We then analyse the distribution of outstanding bonds by investor type to assess the proportion held by price- insensitive investors, such as domestic central banks. Moving to market pricing, we examine pricing trends of major central banks, followed by recent market movements in key rates products. Finally, we update our cross- country PCA of term premia, as well as the seasonality of selected rates instruments. Definitions, methodologies, links to our key views, and recent publications are provided in the appendix.",

This increase in term premia is also evident at the long end of the curve, as 2s30s slopes in most countries extended their steepening momentum through summer. As we head into autumn, seasonals until the end of October remain more favourable for higher term premia.",

This analysis showed debt/GDP has weaker predictive power on future government bond performance, while residuals of mapping between yields and external position measures (e.g., current account, NIIP) exhibit better mean- reverting properties.

In addition to the conventional twin deficit calculation, which is simply the sum of the projected Budget & Current Account deficit of each country data from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) database, we have also created a \"twin deficits score\". For each year, the twin deficits score is a weighted average of the previous years' twin deficits. We assign a higher weight to this year's Twin Deficit (t), followed by gradually lowering the weights of the past five years (t- 1, t- 2, ..., t- 5) twin deficits and finally adding some weight to the cumulative twin deficit up to year t- 5. This allows us to create a synthetic twin deficit score which combines both the most recent flows and the historical stock of budget & current account deficits. Considering the fundamental difference between Norway and other G10 countries, we make adjustments to Norway's twin surpluses and NIIP when mapping with its market pricing.",

Prior to the latest news, she expressed greater concerns around the labor market and appeared to lean towards supporting a near- term rate cut. As such, we do not anticipate a titanic shift to take place if Cook is in fact replaced. Nonetheless, with support for potentially steep rate cuts likely a prerequisite for candidates to replace Cook, another Trump appointee on the Board would add reliable voice for easier policy, even in the face of higher inflation that is to come. Indeed, the potential for four dissenters from Governors - a majority of the Board - could intensify internal pressure for easier policy ahead.",

But, theoretically at least, a Board with a majority that did not agree with the FOMC decision could set IORB at a different - in this case lower - level. If the goal is to achieve lower rates, and the FOMC is not supportive, one unprecedented way to do that would be through this channel. That said, there may be limits to the related impact, as the FOMC sets the ONRRP rate and could continue to do so with a goal of keeping overnight repo rates near its target range. That would create unprecedented dynamics in money markets but potentially mute the impact of lower IORB out the curve.",

Threats to Fed independence are likely to lead to higher inflation expectations and inflation risk premia, and potentially make investors wary of owning longer- term Treasuries. This twist- steepening is in fact what occurred last evening and this morning in response to the news of Cook's removal.

Regarding other details of the report, average hourly earnings (+0.3% vs. +0.3%) and hours worked (34.3hrs vs. 34.3hrs) should remain steady, with the upshot being that the year- over- year growth rate of our payroll proxy for nominal income would fall by roughly 40bps to 4.8% - a still healthy level supportive of consumer spending.

Deutsche Bank provides liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have shorter- term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer- term ratings. Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/), and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high- conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near- term or medium- term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12- month view of total return or investment return as described herein.

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",

Unlike an actual performance record based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.",

Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within the Deutsche Bank Group. Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in research reports published by Deutsche Bank AG. Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of Deutsche Bank AG.",
