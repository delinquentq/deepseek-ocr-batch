As a result, share prices of French companies came under renewed pressure, including our coverage (Vinci, Eiffage, AdP, Getlink, Saint Gobain).

The downside to most stocks appears modest, especially relative to the upside. In addition, if political noise does not materialize (i.e., no material shift in taxation or infrastructure policy), upside is even larger, and the current price levels present an excellent buying opportunity. This would be similar to what was seen at the end of August 2024, when political uncertainty caused a correction in French share price levels, which later reversed as stability returned. We advise caution around AdP and see the stock as fairly priced at current levels, with more substantially more downside if taxation should materialize.",

Following French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's announcement of a confidence vote on his government to be held on 8 September, the share prices of French infrastructure and building materials came under renewed pressure.

The cause for the confidence vote was the disagreement over the government's budget proposal, which foresees austerity measures worth €44bn.

This could impact our coverage negatively, especially when the buyback payments are lower than expected.

Given the bilateral overview of Getlink's operations, there is limited risk of an increase in taxation to the group. In our view, the key risk is anchored in the increase of French government bond yields, which would impact Getlink's WACC and thus valuation: assuming a 100bps increase, we see the floor of Getlink's fair value at €13.81 per share - some \\(15\\%\\) below current share price levels and - \\(19\\%\\) below our current SOTP valuation.",

However, 3 quarters have passed since, and we are still in the trough, with no recovery in sight. The political uncertainty and higher taxes could lead to further weakening of the French construction volumes and pricing could get tougher in the worst case.

In case new elections are announced by Macron, they are likely to take place between end- October and mid- November (the first round must happen between 20 and 40 days post- announcement).

      "text": "- ...While Saint Gobain would suffer from a corporate tax hike. The direct impact on Saint Gobain would come in the form of higher taxation, which would be hard to pass on to consumers via pricing increases given the softness of the French construction market. France has been the weakest market in Europe and the recovery is getting delayed; Saint Gobain have been saying since Q4'24 that the French market has troughed. However, 3 quarters have passed since, and we are still in the trough, with no recovery in sight. The political uncertainty and higher taxes could lead to further weakening of the French construction volumes and pricing could get tougher in the worst case. However, these impacts are expected to be rather limited to Saint Gobain's fair valuation, and we maintain our MP rating and PT of €100/share, going into the CMD on 6th Oct.",

The downside to most stocks appears modest, especially relative to the upside. In addition, if political noise does not materialize (i.e., no material shift in taxation or infrastructure policy), upside is even larger, and the current price levels present an excellent buying opportunity for Vinci and Eiffage. This would be similar to what was seen at the end of August 2024, when political uncertainty caused a correction in French share price levels, which later reversed as stability returned. We advise caution around AdP and see the stock as fairly priced at current levels, with more substantially more downside if taxation should materialize.",

In this model, we forecast the level of tariff increases and apply a discount or premium based on the expected performance relative to the regulatory WACC. The non- regulated segment in Paris, encompassing the Retail, Real Estate, and Telecommunication businesses, is valued using various valuation methods: we apply a target EV/EBITDA multiple to the retail (12x) and real estate (18x) segments and value recently acquired retail businesses at acquisition price (€360m); we also apply an EV/EBITDA multiple to AdP's Hub One business (7.5x), based on other asset- light telcoms; and we value the group's existing land reserves around its Parisian airports at fair value (€221m). AdP's international assets are valued using various valuation methods: the stake in Turkish airport operator TAV is valued at market value, to which we apply a discount to account for elevated political risk (- 15%); the stake in AIG is valued by applying a median EV/EBITDA multiple based on international airport operator peers; the stake in Indian airport operator GMR is valued through the average of its discounted market value (- 30%), our DCF analysis (WACC: 9.9%), and an adjusted EV/EBITDA multiple based on Fraport's recent disposal of its stake in Delhi airport (13.1x); and we estimate the value of AdP's other international assets.
