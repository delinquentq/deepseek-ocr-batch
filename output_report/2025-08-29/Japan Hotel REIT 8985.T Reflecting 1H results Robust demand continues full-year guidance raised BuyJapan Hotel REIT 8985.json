In 2H, JHR expects the rate of increase in ADR and the occupancy rate (ADR: \\(+6.5\\%\\) yoy; occupancy rate: \\(+2.2\\%\\) yoy) to slow compared with 1H due to the strong performance in the year- ago period, negative publicity related to the July 5 major disaster prophecy, and lower demand for theme parks due to extreme heat. However, it forecasts that RevPAR will rise further (full- year guidance: ¥21,205) on continued robust inbound demand and increased sales in the food & beverage business on a recovery in MICE demand.",
