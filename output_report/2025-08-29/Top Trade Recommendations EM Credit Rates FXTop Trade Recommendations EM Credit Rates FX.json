      "text": "In the Weekly Markets View section, we discuss how the recent steepening of the UST curve has led to a meaningful flattening of EM USD spread curves, especially among EM IG sovereigns. The KAZAKS curve is a case in point. While spreads of the KAZAKS 2032s and 2037s have not moved much since the bonds were issued in late June, those at the long end of the curve (KAZAKS 2044s/2045s) have tightened considerably (Figure 1). This has left the curve very flat, with the 2032s and 2037s screening as cheap. And while Kazakhstan's fundamental trajectory remains on solid footing, as evidenced by S&P's decision to revise the country's BBB- rating outlook to positive last weekend, we think that spreads at the long end provide little buffer against potential further volatility in rates. Hence, we think that shortening duration makes sense.",

Contrary to the broader trend, the spread curve between NGERIA 2047s and NGERIA 2033s has flattened only marginally recently and remains at very steep levels in a historical context, resulting in a very meaningful yield difference between the two bonds (Figure 2). As also highlighted in the Weekly Markets View section, we think it is possible that Nigeria will return to markets over the next few months, but given the steep yield curve and the overall high level of yields, we would expect any such issuance to be focused on the 5- 10y sector. We rate Nigeria sovereign credit OW and think that an extension into the long end makes sense at current levels.",

China has allowed the CNY and CFETS to strengthen, despite a relatively flat USD, amid a further trade truce with the US. China is sending a message with recent CNY strength and confidence amid resilient exports performance. Sentiment towards Chinese equities has turned increasingly positive and South Bound stock connect flows have accelerated over recent weeks. We think the PBoC will maintain a relatively firm bias for CNY in a controlled manner in the short term and prefer to reflect this via a long CNY CFETS trade idea, rather than outright short USDCNH, due to adverse carry costs. We continue to think that a significant CNY rally against the USD would require tailwinds from DXY softness.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
