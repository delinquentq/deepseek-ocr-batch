Reflecting these solid figures, we have raised our PT from HK\\$27 to HK\\$32. However, we have not upgraded the stock to OW. This is for three reasons. Firstly, CPIC did not propose an interim dividend. Secondly, the company's dividend policy is linked to OPAT growth (1H25: \\(7\\%\\) oya), and we see limited upside on the \\(2.5\\%\\) FY25E consensus dividend yield or DPS (Rmb 1.13/share, \\(5\\%\\) oya), considering earnings seasonality and reserve growth trends. Thirdly, the life sales quality appears less robust compared to major peers (China Life/Ping An), as the 1H25 life sales have been significantly supported by bancassurance (1H25 first-year premium: agent (Rmb22.6B, \\(- 7.7\\%\\) oya) vs. bancassurance (Rmb29.0B, \\(95.6\\%\\) oya)). As such, we prefer larger-cap insurers (China Life-H/Ping An-H) over CPIC-H.",

Unlike previous years, China's SOE insurers, such as China Life, PICC Group, and PICC P&C, are beginning to place greater emphasis on shareholder returns, with double- digit interim dividend increases this reporting season with higher earnings growth. They are trading at an 8x FY26E P/E with a \\(3\\%\\) yield. As the market may adjust the currently conservative dividend forecasts for SOE insurers, the yield differential is expected to narrow. Additionally, Ping An- H offers a \\(6\\%\\) yield, accompanied by multiple signs of a fundamental turnaround- (link). As such, in our view, for CPIC to achieve stock outperformance for the rest of year, it may need to consider providing more aggressive year- end guidance.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P.

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
