      "text": "Peruvian banks reported regulatory figures for July, and we have a positive first take, especially for Credicorp (BAP). Net income for BAP is tracking \\(+9\\%\\) higher than JPM and BBG consensus at PEN 1,810mn. Both BCP (- 27.5% ROE) and Mibanco (- 24.5% ROE) demonstrated strong earnings dynamics, driving a - 27% blended ROE. Meanwhile, IFS (bank unit only) is tracking at PEN 360mn. Assuming it represents \\(80\\%\\) of total results, we estimate a - PEN 450mn run- rate for IFS, which is a \\(10 - 5\\%\\) miss vs. JPM and consensus, respectively. Beyond net income, we believe the main focus recently has been loan growth. We observe BAP, through its BCP unit, accelerating loan growth by \\(+1.7\\%\\) M- o- M, now growing \\(4\\%\\) Y- o- Y. This is still short of its \\(6.5\\%\\) annual guidance but represents a positive step toward achieving it. Seasonality does not explain this, in our view. While July has more days than June, this is not the case for working days, as Peruvian Independence Day / Fiestas Patrias takes place in July. In the past two years, we actually saw loans decrease or remain flat in July vs. June. Meanwhile, IFS grew \\(1.2\\%\\) M- o- M but continued to deliver a better \\(6.6\\%\\) Y- o- Y growth pace. Other highlights include: (i) NIM - expanded 10bps vs. 2Q25 for BAP and remained flat for IFS; (ii) NPL - improved 10bps vs. 2Q25 for both banks; (iii) deposits grew \\(1.5\\%\\) M- o- M / \\(8.1\\%\\) Y- o- Y for BAP and remained flat M- o- M / \\(4.5\\%\\) Y- o- Y for IFS. We find the data positive for BAP and good news post the recent rally (BAP \\(+40\\%\\) YTD - true, not significantly different from \\(+38\\%\\) performance for ITUB- Banorte). The company now trades at \\(- 9.8x26\\) E/P/E and \\(- 1.9x25\\) E book - not a bargain, but growth acceleration combined with high ROEs could continue to drive share momentum. Please find more details in the table below and charts inside the report summarizing different growth dynamics.",
