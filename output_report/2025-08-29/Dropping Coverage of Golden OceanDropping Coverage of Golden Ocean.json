The dry bulk market is highly volatile with spot rates changing on an ongoing daily and intra- daily basis due to tanker vessel supply and charterer demand changes. The dry bulk market is driven by iron ore, coal, grains and minor bulk cargo availability. Vessel newbuilding and secondhand prices are driven by charter rates and shipyard construction costs with changes in steel and labor major factors in overall costs. Higher interest rates typically are associated with declining ship values while lower interest rates could lead to higher values. The changes in ship values therefore impact the balance sheet and various leverage ratios.",
