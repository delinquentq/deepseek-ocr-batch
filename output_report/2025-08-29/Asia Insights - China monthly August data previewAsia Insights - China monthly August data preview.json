We expect the PMIs to remain low, export and IP growth to moderate, and retail sales growth to remain subdued. Daily average stock trading volume soared to a record high of RMB2.3trn in August, but its positive spillovers to the real economy might be quite limited. Chinese households' assets are still concentrated in property, while the salaries of financial practitioners remain largely capped. The rising growth headwinds call for more policy support, but deploying pro- growth measures might risk causing a stock market bubble. In our view, Beijing's best strategy is to draw lessons from the past, resist the temptation to fuel the stock markets through high- profile monetary measures in the near term, remain vigilant by avoiding contractionary policies, clean up the property mess, and address some deep- rooted problems such as the unequal social security system.",
