      "text": "Share performance: In August, real estate stocks outperformed TOPIX. This was driven by a rebound from underperformance between May and July, fading rate hike expectations, and strong 1Q results (such as expanding office momentum and robust condo sales). Investors favored real estate stocks for their solid fundamentals and defensive earnings. A continued outperformance scenario assumes excess liquidity will keep attracting investment into defensively positioned real estate names. However, valuations have approached or exceeded April 2024 levels, when Mitsui Fudosan announced its long- term strategy and sector ratings rose. This raises the risk of a correction. Potential triggers include renewed rate hike expectations, a sharp rise in long- term interest rates globally, or renewed debate over restrictions on speculative condo transactions. The TSE REIT index slightly underperformed TOPIX in August but still ended in positive territory (Exhibit 9).",
