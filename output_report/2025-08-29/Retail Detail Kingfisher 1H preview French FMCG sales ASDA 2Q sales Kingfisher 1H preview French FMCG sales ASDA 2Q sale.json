      "text": "\\\\*\\\\*BARCLAYS RESEARCH: Kingfisher - 1H preview (due 23 Sep)\\\\*\\\\* We update our model following Kingfisher's 1Q25/26 trading statement. LFL sales were better than we expected in the UK and France, driven primarily by weather- sensitive seasonal categories, but behind our expectations in Poland, with the company citing geopolitical factors that are weighing on sentiment. We suspect the strong outcome partly reflects pulled- forward demand from 2Q25/26 - especially given seasonal products are typically 'once- a- season' purchases (e.g., barbecues). Indeed, Kingfisher reiterated its relatively wide PBT guidance range (c.£480m to £540m), which supports the notion that strong 1Q trends should not necessarily be extrapolated forward through the rest of the year. We increase our FY25/26 PBT forecast to £525m from £520m (vs Bloomberg consensus of £522m) - assuming roughly half of the 1Q25/26 sales beat was a 'genuine' beat and roughly half was pulled- forward demand from 2Q25/26. Our EPS estimates rise by \\(+0.8\\%\\) for FY25/26 but remain unchanged for the next two years. We reiterate our Underweight stock rating, with an unchanged price target of 280p. Next event is 1H25/26 results on 23 September. On our numbers, Kingfisher trades on a FY25/26 PE of 13.3x.\\\\*",

      "text": "\\*\\*BARCLAYS RESEARCH: Boohoo - FY25 model update; strategy becoming clearer but outlook tough\\*\\* Boohoo is in the early stages of a multi- year turnaround strategy. Performance recovery of the company now rests on three key pillars: scaling Debenhams' asset- light marketplace model across the Group, expanding margins, and 'right- sizing' the Youth Brands, which we view as the most structurally challenged. While Debenhams is showing encouraging growth, its current scale is small (- £650m GMV). We remain cautious on the feasibility of replicating the asset- light model across the Youth Brands, where operational complexity and brand positioning may limit its effectiveness. Although the mid- term strategy is becoming clearer, we believe it will take time to translate into results, and Boohoo's outlook remains challenged. A potential sale of PLT could unlock some value for the Group, though we expect any valuation to be materially below what Boohoo originally paid & no obvious buyer at this stage. We still don't forecast positive FCF (post SBC, leases) until FY27 and positive EPS until FY29. Boohoo trades on - 7x '26E EV/EBITDA - more expensive than Zalando (- 5x), which has both FCF and EPS making a valuation easier to underpin. The balance sheet is looking better post- refi but is still stretched (net debt at FY25 of - £78m). We prefer names in our coverage with positive and accelerating growth, well capitalised balance sheets, and near- term FCF/EPS support.\\*\\*",

ASDA's own inflation rate remains \"significantly lower\" than the +5% market rate in August; ii) Product availability increased to 96% - its highest level in eight years - which compares with 90% in January; iii) Project Future (IT system separation from Walmart) is now complete (as of last week) with all stores, food depots and head offices operating on the new IT system. Allan Leighton, Asda's Executive Chairman, said that the \"collective rate of [Project Future] completion did cause some temporary disruption with product availability and in our online experience, which will impact our sales outturn in the current quarter.\" Leighton still expects to exit the year in LFL growth.\\^",

Waitrose is trialling an Al system that identifies items as shoppers place them into their trolleys at its Bracknell store, reported The Grocer yesterday. Shoppers scan the barcodes on items as they would with a self- scan handset in front of the device, then place it in the trolley. Once placed, back- facing cameras verify the product. The devices are stored in a charging bank near the entrance to the store and released once a customer has scanned their loyalty card. Customers are required to weigh loose produce at an in- aisle scale and then scan the barcode before placing the item in the trolley. The devices are supplied by Shopic, which says supermarkets can use location data from the devices to see how long shoppers spent in each aisle, their \"shelf interactions\", and their route around a store, as well as being a platform for retail media as the large screen on the devices can also be used to serve \"contextually relevant ads and offers\". The Bracknell store is also trialling shelf inventory cameras from Focal Systems to give store staff \"real- time information on what products are out of stock\" as well as electronic shelf labels Solum to \"simplify price and compliance processes\", according to a spokesperson.\\^",

We use a common DCF methodology for all our companies (formulaic fade rates, capex fading towards depreciation, etc). The two key inputs - apart from WACC, which is necessarily somewhat subjective - are for the terminal margin and growth rates. For Carrefour we assume a terminal EBIT margin of 3.4%, slightly up compared with the level we forecast in 2027E. We think this is realistic given the structural constraints on the company's margins (formats, real estate, franchises). We assume 1.5% terminal sales growth, which is at the lower end of the 1.0-2.5% range that we use for companies in the sector - reflecting its exposure to a mix of mature European markets and developing markets. 'Sum-of-the-parts. We apply different EV/sales multiples on the various segments, reflecting their expected profit margins and growth rates.
