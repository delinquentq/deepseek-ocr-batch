As part of this plan, the group also intend to dispose of PLT. Given this disposal, we have reduced our GMV base by \\(30\\%\\) (ex PLT) but improved EBITDA/revenue to \\(5.8\\%\\) (from \\(3.3\\%\\) ). With the move to a marketplace model we have also reduced FY26E capex and inventory to £22mn and £76mn (from FY24 £65mn and £208mn). However, in the context of a weakening UK consumer environment (FY25E GS HAC +1.7%), and ongoing structural competition (including Chinese exporters), we have reduced FY26- 30E GMV growth to +2% (from +5%). Taken together, we retain a cautious stance with TP to 16p, and Sell rating.",

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
