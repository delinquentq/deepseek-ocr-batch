This should alleviate any concerns that NXT didn't have any experience in securing capital partners, something which the REITs are very good at. Given that NXT already owns the land, the potential equity injection is only ~&#36;500m. Importantly, the debt in the JV is non-recourse to NXT. Drawing a comparison to EQIX's xScale JV programmes, the target unlevered returns are 8-12%, and up to 17% for levered returns. NXT has also upsized its debt facility to &#36;6.4bn, with &#36;5.3bn undrawn. Together with strong cash flow, this debt level should be sufficient to fund its capex programme in the short term (~&#36;2bn pa).",
