NRE revenue is expected to begin by the end of this year, but management highlighted that multiple tape-outs will be needed due to the complex design. Mass production is likely to be in 2028 at the earliest. Despite investor concerns about third-party IP readiness affecting Alchip's competitive advantage, management expressed strong confidence in its third party partners' IP readiness, noting that AI accelerators are a fast-growing market and a key focus for allocating IP resources among leading IP vendors including Synopsys and Cadence. In addition, management believes that key clients will stick with the same vendor for multiple design cycles to save turnaround time and benefit from smoother communication between engineering teams.",

We believe this project is likely for a US social media CSP's AI ASIC, but we don't expect Alchip to have a high chance of winning this project given the complexity of the project (likely using 3.5D IC) and the engagement model (PD1 or RTL/netlist-in may require far higher resources, in our view.",

Management shared that the startups are eager to work with Alchip to leverage its relationships with large CSPs and would also rely on Alchip's physical design for the projects. We believe these alliances will strengthen Alchip's ability to bid on complex AI projects while maintaining flexibility in offering different levels of turnkey solutions. As large ASIC projects become more cost focused, the disaggregated approach (IP, front-end design and back-end design services all coming from different vendors) could become more sought after, which should benefit Alchip.",
