The update FY26 outlook was just as impressive with revenue and billings targets being raised by 1 pt adjusting for cc and the transaction model. ADSK provided its first look at medium-term operating margin target guiding to 41% (45% exclusive of transaction model) for FY29. While targets seems conservative, we think it is a good starting point to provide upside efficiency to S&M expense over time and we expect to get more information on long-term financial targets at their analyst day on Oct 7. We raise our estimates to the high end of guidance,which moves our TP to &#36;393 and implies 34x FY27 EV/FCF.",

Revenue grew 18%y/y cc and exceeded the high end of guidance by 2 pts with the transaction model contributing &#36;105M to Q2 revenue. Revenue outperformance was driven by AECO,which grew 24% y/y cc and noted as seeing strong demand in data centers,infrastructure, and industrial buildings. While M&E demand wasn't that impressive (only growing 4% y/y), MFG continued to perform well growing 14% y/y cc. By region Americas and EMEA were particularly strong growing 19% y/y cc each while APAC grew 14% y/y cc. Bookings were also strong in the Q with cRPO accelerating 4 by to 20% y/y and RPO growing 25% y/y. Operating margins were 1 pt above consensus with the management noting some benefits from timing of hiring in the Q. EPS was &#36;2.62 and beat the high end of the guide by ~6.5 pts.

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",
