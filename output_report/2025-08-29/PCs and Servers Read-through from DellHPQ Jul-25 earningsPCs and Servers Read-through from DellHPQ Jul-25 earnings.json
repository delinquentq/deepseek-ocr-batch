Server margins have tracked behind expectations due to higher GB200 mix and some one- off GB200 ramping costs, which was consistent with Wistron's feedback. Looking forward, management continues to see strong AI server demand across CSPs, enterprises, and sovereign AI and has booked US\\\\$5.6bn in new orders. Dell expects an improving AI server margin on mix shift to enterprise and sovereign AI and improving GB200/300 yields. Overall, the company has now raised full year AI server revenue guidance to US\\\\$20bn from previous US\\\\$15bn+ with \\(50\\% /50\\%\\) 1H/2H split. This underpins our research of incremental upside to Dell and Wistron's AI server revenues in 2H25 driven by new GB300 order wins. But the low AI server margin has negative implications for other AI server brand peers and Wistron as ODM partner.",

We attribute the shipment trend divergence to Dell's market share loss in lower- end segments and stronger Chromebook shipment (positive for HPQ). Looking ahead, Dell and HPQ's Oct- Q PC revenue trends are similar at around mid single digit QoQ growth due to normal seasonality. Both Dell and HPQ indicate better PC revenue trend in 2HCY25 vs. 1HCY25, driven by continued Win11 refresh demand, rising AI PC traction, and seasonal strength of consumer PCs. This echoes ASUSTek's comments that PC OEMs' revenue momentum could outperform NB ODMs in 2H25 given the early ODM inventory build in 1H25. Key downside risk is Section 232 semi- tariff uncertainty.",
