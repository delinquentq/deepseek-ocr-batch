That said, there were still some blemishes in the print - (i) the magnitude of the EBITDA beat was less impressive than the headline when excluding an unplanned actuarial accounting \"true- up\" of \\(\\) 10M\\(, (ii) the business is still on a long journey until it reaches positive SSS growth in 2026 or regaining market share, and (iii) Street 4Q EBITDA estimates will come down due to GM pressure from tariffs (private label/supplies) and mgmt.'s decision to have \"dry powder\" to invest in marketing to drive top- line growth. Bottom- line, our EBITDA estimates move slightly higher for FY25 based on the 2Q beat, but our revenue estimates move slightly lower noting 3Q SSS is expected to step- down on tougher 1- year compare. Next catalyst: we will attend a CEO/CFO meeting in NYC on 9/2 and expect a deeper strategic discussion. Maintain Neutral.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note.
