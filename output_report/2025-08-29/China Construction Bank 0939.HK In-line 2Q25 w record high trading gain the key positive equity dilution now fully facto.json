NPAT came in slower at +1.6% y-y (vs. -4.0% y-y in 1Q25), due to provision increase (+50.7% y-y). ROA/ROE were down -5bp/-82bp y-y to 0.72%/10.1% in 2Q25. CCB declared an interim DPS of RMB0.1858 for 1H25, which is down -6% y-y due to i) 1H25 earnings decline by -1.4% y-y and ii) equity dilution of -4.3% from recapitalization. 1H25 payout ratio has been kept unchanged at 30% (flat y-y).",

Net fee income accelerated to +18.5% y-y in 2Q25 (vs. -4.6% y-y in 1Q25), to form 13.9% of total revenue (+0.8ppt y-y in 2Q25), likely backed by stronger-than-expected wealth mgmt. fee/consultancy fee income growth (+35%/+14% y-y in 1H25). Dealing gain surprised on a upside, surging notably by +3.1x q-q/+1.8x y-y to RMB27.7bn, which is an historic high, forming 13.7% of total revenue in 2Q25, +10.1ppt q-q/+8.2ppt y-y in 2Q, possibly backed by favorable bond market condition in 2Q25 and increased FX gain in 2Q. CIR was reduced modestly by -2ppt y-y to 25.6% in 2Q25 mainly thanks to revenue strength (+11.3% y-y in 2Q25) while manageable OPEX increase of +3.3% y-y also helped; CET-1/tier-1/total CAR were up +36bp/+52bp/+36bp q-q to 14.34%/15.19%/19.51% in 2Q25, mainly thanks to RMB105mn equity recapitalization in 2Q, which help boosted CCB's CET1 CAR by 45bp, based on 2Q25 RWA. Effective tax rate was down -2.65ppt y-y to 11.2% in 2Q25, likely thanks to increased government bond investment, which carries tax exemption (w/bond investment forming 26.6% of total assets in 2Q25, up 1.8ppt y-y).

Asset quality was mixed. NPL ratio remains unchanged at \\(1.33\\%\\) (flat q-q) in 2Q25, thanks to lower corporate NPL ratio (- 7bp h-h to \\(1.58\\%\\) in 1H25, with broad-based NPL ratio reduction in most corporate sectors in 1H except for construction/utility sectors), more than offsetting the negative from higher retail NPL ratio (by +11bp h-h to \\(1.10\\%\\) in 1H, driven by increase in mortgage/credit card loan NPL ratio, by +14bp/+13bp h-h to \\(0.76\\% /2.35\\%\\) in 1H25). However, after adding back write-offs, gross NPL formation rate was up +33bp q-q/+10bp y-y to \\(0.62\\%\\) in 2Q25, likely due to increased NPL formation in the retail loan book.

Against the increasing NPL formation trend, CCB charged a conservative credit cost of 88bp in 2Q25 (+14bp q-q/+25bp y-y), which helped drive up NPL coverage ratio to \\(239.4\\%\\) in 2Q25 (+2.6ppt q-q).",

This led to CCB's earnings growth of \\(+1.6\\%\\) y-y in 2Q25 ranking only middle of the pack among Big6 banks in 2Q25 (compared to PSBC/ABC/BOCOM/ICBC/BOC 2Q25 earnings growth of \\(+4.8\\% / + 3.2\\% / + 1.7\\% / + 1.4\\% / 1.0\\%\\) y-y in 2Q25). However, we do not hold it against the bank, as we see its pre- emptive/countercyclical provisioning practice could help better prepare the bank for potential NPL formation increase in 2H25, and create more room for provision release in 2H25E, to help bring CCB's 2025E fully- year NPAT growth to be at least flattish y-y (vs. CCB's 1H25 earnings decline of - \\(1.4\\%\\) y-y does not rank well vs. Big6 bank peers in 1H). After factoring in the equity dilution of \\(4.3\\%\\) from the recapitalization, we flag that CCB- A/- H 2025E dividend yield remains decent at \\(4.2\\% /5.4\\%\\) , ranking the highest/third highest among Big6 banks.",

CCB's strong balance sheet, low risk profile (lowest risky loans and highest mortgage loan exposure among peers) and high profitability make it more resilient to the macro headwinds than its peers. As the bank with the highest loan exposure to mortgages and infrastructure loans, CCB is the key beneficiary from the recent strong credit growth to the two sectors and that should mean the bank's NPLs peak out ahead of its peers. Despite its low- risk profile, the bank has been conservative in NPL recognition as evidenced by it having the highest NPL to overdue \\(>3m\\) ratio (171% as of 2017). CCB enjoys above- peer profitability (the second highest ROA among our coverage), driven by the lowest funding cost and low CIR.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—“ and “-“ respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management.Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note.

Statements and views concerning ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors are typically based upon public statements made by the affected company or other public news, which the author may not have independently verified. ESG factors are one consideration that investors may choose to examine when making investment decisions. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",

The securities of non- U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for exact dividend computations.
