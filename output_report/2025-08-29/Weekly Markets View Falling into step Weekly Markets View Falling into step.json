In contrast, the recent leg of UST curve steepening has led to a meaningful flattening of EM spread curves (Figure 1), which have now reverted to their usual negative correlation with the US rates curve. For the Asian credit market specifically, we discussed this in Asia Credit Strategy: Spread curve dislocations, 26 August 2025, but this has been a phenomenon across EM regions, and including EM HY and IG sovereigns (Figure 2). Naturally, such sharp curve moves can provide opportunities for tactical trades to optimise exposure along specific curves that have deviated from the broader trend or where the flattening has been excessive.

As a result, our US economics team now expects the Fed to restart its rate cut cycle sooner. They forecast a 25bp cut in September, followed by another 25bp in December. This would bring the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75- 4.00% by the end of 2025.

This week, the central bank of the Philippines (BSP) cut its policy rate by another 25bp to \\(5.00\\%\\) , as widely expected, likely on the basis of benign CPI inflation. In the press conference following the release of the policy statement, BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr revealed that the central bank thinks it could be near the end of its easing cycle – but indicated that there is perhaps room for one more 25bp rate cut. Overall, we maintain our base case of another 25bp rate cut in October, though the risk is of a delay if the BSP decides to wait for more data to assess how price prices are reacting to the government's decision to halt rice imports for 60 days from 1 September. However, even if another 25bp rate cut materializes, this would leave the policy rate at a still relatively high \\(4.75\\%\\) – which implies the risk of further normalization via even more rate cuts if CPI inflation does turn out to be more benign than the BSP expects.",

This decision marked a shift from the BoK's earlier pattern of quarterly rate cuts, as it chose to wait for further stabilization in housing price momentum. Nonetheless, the BoK governor extended forward guidance for the easing cycle through the first half of 2026. We believe the threshold for avoiding further easing in 2026 remains high, and we continue to anticipate additional rate cuts in October 2025 and February 2026. The central bank of Hungary (NBH) also kept its policy rate steady at \\(6.5\\%\\) , expecting inflation to stay above target through 2025 and only return to \\(3\\%\\) in early 2027. Citing strong consumption, volatile prices, and wage growth, the central bank emphasized the need for tight policy and signaled rates will likely stay on hold.

Per the budget guidelines bill (PLDO) presented in April, next year's primary balance target is a surplus of BRL34.3bn (or \\(0.25\\%\\) of GDP). However, excluding BRL55.1bn in precartario payments not subject to the rules, the government can present a primary deficit of BRL20.8bn and technically still be in compliance with the center of the target.
