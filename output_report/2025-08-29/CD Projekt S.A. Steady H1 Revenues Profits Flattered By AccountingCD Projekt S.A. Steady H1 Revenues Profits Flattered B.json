      "text": "Summary. CD Projekt has reported steady H1 revenues (PLN 443m (+4% year- on- year), +4% above VA consensus at PLN 424m). Revenues were mainly driven by solid sales of Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion, which has surpassed 10m copies sold as of the end of May 2025 (vs. previously announced 8m as of November 2024). The title also launched on the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. 2025, with management commenting on the game being among the best- selling 3rd party games on the console to date, and well positioned to benefit from the growing Switch 2 user base. Operating profit was ahead (PLN 168m (+20% year- on- year) and+9% above consensus) flattered by accounting treatment with cost of sales 12% lower (extended useful life), and lower admin expenses (research work costs declined 61% after the Cyberpunk 2 project changed its IFRS status from research to development which qualifies for capitalization) helping offset higher selling expenses (increased as a result of increased promotional activity, notably around the CP77 Switch launch and the Witcher 4 tech demo in June). Conversely, net income declined 9%, impacted by the accounting treatment of withholding tax relating to previous years. All in all, cash declined PLN 45m in H1.",

Cyberpunk 2 having moved to pre- production in Q2, had 116 developers allocated to the project. Management previously hinted to a typical 4- 5 year window between pre- production and game release. Management has also confirmed that Witcher 4 will be released in 2027 at the earliest, which leaves the company without a material release for potentially 2+ years (note here). The company anticipates further gradual growth in developer headcount into the full year, particularly for teams working on the most advanced projects. As announced previously the projects are in the development stage, three of which are still unannounced (two of which are gaming projects). The company has not provided further details on the previously announced partnership with publisher Scopely to develop a game set within one of CD Projekt's IPs. During H1 PLN 242m was invested into new development projects.",
