We have 2 competing CTDs in this roll cycle the \\(0\\%\\) Aug 52 and the \\(2.5\\%\\) Aug 54. The Aug 54 would become the new CTD in the case of at least 80bp parallel rally whilst \\(\\sim 90bp\\) parallel sell-off would imply a switch to the Aug 52. Additionally, a flattening of the 56- 54 spread of at least 5bp would allow a CTD switch to the Aug 54. The 56- 54 spread has been trading within a \\(\\sim 1bp\\) range over the last 5 months; hence this scenario would require the curve to reach new lows, which we think is unlikely.",
