July quarter margins were negatively impacted from a higher AI contribution mix and one-time costs associated with expedited shipping. Management raised CY25 (FY26) AI revenue expectations to ~$20bln (doubling y/y) with strong backlog comprising of growing contribution from enterprise and sovereign which bodes well for storage/services attach and margins ahead. FY26 revenue and EPS guide raise embodies higher AI server revenue contribution (+5bln) partially offset with weakness in traditional server and storage (~$1bln), albeit with improving margins in 2H. Our estimates undergo minor changes, and we maintain our Buy rating, Target Price at $160.

      "text": "Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return (\"ETR\") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"—\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds \\(15\\%\\) against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share- price movement will not materialize as expected.",
