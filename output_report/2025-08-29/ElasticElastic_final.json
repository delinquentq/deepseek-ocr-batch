Total revenue was well ahead of the high end of the company's revenue guidance as well as consensus estimates. Embedded leverage in the model flowed through to better profitability and FCF as operating margins expanded 500bps y/y to \\(15.7\\%\\) with FCF margins of \\(25\\%\\) for the quarter. Outperformance was passed through to full year guidance as the increase to full year revenue guidance was greater than the magnitude of beat compared to guidance for 1Q. Guidance reflects macro conditions that didn't deteriorate as much as the company had initially feared. The company called out Gen AI related momentum in the quarter with traction as a runtime platform for building conversational AI and agentic applications. In addition to Gen AI, management cited platform consolidation as a meaningful tailwind during the quarter across Search, Observability, and Security. GTM changes the company implemented last year continue to bear fruit as the sales organization remains focused on expanding enterprise accounts and landing high- potential mid- market customers. We are encouraged by the healthy sales execution and ongoing innovation across Elastic's platform as the company continues to leverage its market position to capitalize on the convergence of Observability and Security. We remain Overweight rated as we increase our estimates and price target to reflect solid outperformance and improving outlook.",
