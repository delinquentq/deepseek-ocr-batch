The releases this week brought limited new insight into the labor market, though we will get a clearer picture next week with the release of the August employment report.

The Federal Reserve Act does not specify what \"for cause\" means, though a common interpretation is inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance while in office. Once a clearer template is established for how the executive branch will determine a valid cause, it is possible that this administration, or future ones, might become more prone to using for cause dismissals.",

We recently hypothesized that this could result from increased enforcement of the administration's immigration policies; especially the termination of humanitarian parole programs such as CHNV, which may lead to increased turnover in select industries, although the evidence so far is mixed. Following the spike in separations among government workers at the beginning of the year, caused by DOGE- led efforts to reduce the workforce, the latest reading in this category shows a separation rate of \\(1.2\\%\\) , the lowest since the summer of 2014.",

      "text": "Revisions have been a hot topic ever since the large down-ward revisions that accompanied the July payroll report. Their magnitude was unusually large, but their direction was not, as revisions have been consistently negative over the last few years. Looking at past years, the August release was typically revised up, leading one to discount weakness in the first release, but this trend has reversed in the last few years, at least by the time of the third release. For the already-released July data there is not a clear pattern. In the last couple years there was a downward revision with the second release and a net upward revision by the time of the third release, but this may not be a new pattern. Finally, for the June data, revisions have been consistently negative since 2022. Normally,though, the big downward revisions come with the third",

One possible approach is to note that when summing the unemployment data by reason, new entrants accounted for \\(60\\%\\) of the increase. Given the overall unemployment rate rose \\(13\\) bps, a way of framing this is to estimate that new entrants accounted for \\(60\\%\\) of that 13bps increase, or 8bps, and that a full reversal would cause the unemployment rate to fall by an equivalent amount.",
