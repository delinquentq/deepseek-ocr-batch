However, it's important to keep this in perspective: DT's German retail broadband base is 15m, broadband revenue is 31% of DT Germany's revenue, while Germany is 31% of DT's proportionate OpFCF. It is for this reason that despite disappointing net adds for several quarters, DT continues to deliver strong EBITDA growth, at a group level and in Germany (Figure 4). As well as the various stabilisation efforts discussed on the Q2 results call, we believe that DT may also consider accelerating its fibre rollout beyond the current 2.5m premises per annum.",

It is similar at EBITDA, where Q3'24 saw the strongest growth of 2024. While Q2'25 saw a positive and a negative 'one- off' (the wage agreement provision in Q2'24 created an easy comparator; Q2'25 was negatively impacted by €50m due to an IFRS 15 contract adjustment), Q3'25 sees two wage- related negatives (impact of last year's 6% salary increase agreement, as Q3'24 still had wage costs running at the lower run- rate; and Q3'25 faces a €190 per month per employee salary increase from 1 Aug 2025). As such, we forecast German Q3 service revenue growth of +0.9% (Q2 +1.1%), including fixed +0.3% (Q2 +0.8%) and mobile +2.1% (Q2 +2.0%), and EBITDAAL growth of +1.1% (Q2 +2.0%).",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"—\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",
