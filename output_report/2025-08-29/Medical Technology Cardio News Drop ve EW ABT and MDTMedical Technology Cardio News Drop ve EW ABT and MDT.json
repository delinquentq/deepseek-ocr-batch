TAVR is now to be considered for asymptomatic patients (vs. watchful waiting prior), while the age threshold was reduced to 70, which is material given the average TAVR age in Europe is around 81- 82 (prior guide was for 75 and older). Note that today in Europe, EW is the only player with asymptomatic approval. Other valves got a boost too, with Mitral valve TEER upgraded to Class Ia (recommended) for sever function (or secondary) MR, while Tricuspid TEER was upgraded to Class IIb (should be considered) for those with severe TR. Overall the guideline changes are a solid positive for all three players, shifting intervention earlier and streamlining the care pathway overall, as well as potentially accelerating referrals to Heart Teams.",
