The contraction largely reflected a \\(27\\%\\) decline in real exports (broadly in line with the BoC's expectations) as frontloading in Q1 unwound and tariffs began to bite. The composition of today's GDP print was somewhat mixed, however, as real consumption growth \\((+4.5\\%)\\) and residential investment \\((+6.3\\%)\\) exceeded the BoC's expectations but nonresidential investment \\((- 10.1\\%)\\) surprised notably to the downside. Government spending contributed 1.1pp to annualized GDP growth, while the volatile inventories category added 3.2pp. Real household net disposable income grew by \\(0.8\\%\\) in Q1 (vs. \\(+1.0\\%\\) in Q1) and the saving rate declined 1pp to \\(5.0\\%\\) . Smoothing through the large swings in net trade, real GDP grew at an annualized pace of \\(+0.2\\%\\) on average in H1, below the \\(+0.4\\%\\) average pace expected in the July MPR and well below potential. As a result, we expect that the BoC will deem further easing necessary to close the output gap, and we maintain our call for a cut at the September meeting. We continue to see risks as skewed towards further easing.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
