We have grouped Gap into a cohort of names that despite healthy balance sheets, lack clear positive catalysts, have high tariff / Asia sourcing exposure, and where earnings risk is skewed to the downside (CROX, WWW, GAP). We also remain cognizant of the 1) outsized exposure to the low & middle income consumer and 2) intensely competitive environment in the premium athleisure space, evidenced by Athleta's underperformance. Taken together we think fair value on the notes is 30-50bp wider than current levels based on indices and peer trading levels (BB index, M, VSCO, BBWI).",

Athleta stood out for its underperformance, with sales down 11% and comparable sales dropping 9%, highlighting ongoing brand challenges. The operating margin outlook for fiscal 2025 was revised downward, mainly due to higher- than- expected tariff impacts. While cost management efforts supported profitability, the company continued to prioritize shareholder returns, distributing \\(\\) 144\\(million through share repurchases and dividends. Margins contracted, partly as a result of lapping last year's credit card benefit. Overall, anemic growth at most banners, a softer margin outlook, and persistent challenges at Athleta suggest to us ongoing headwinds for Gap.",
