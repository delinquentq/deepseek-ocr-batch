We suspect the jump reported for core goods inflation at the Euro area level in July was due to the late timing of seasonal sales, which likely reversed in August. As sales appear to have started quite late this year and last year, this effect is not clearly visible in the annual changes (e.g. of clothing/ footwear). Italy is often responsible for a significant part of such seasonal effects.",

The risk is skewed to a smaller decrease to \\(2.2\\%\\) oya. However, with Italy also having reported now, this may only be due to Germany and, hence, narrowly based.
