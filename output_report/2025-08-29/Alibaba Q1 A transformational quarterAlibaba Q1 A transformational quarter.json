Alibaba's stated goal to become the leading food delivery and quick commerce player in China will sound ominous to Meituan, two days after the latter failed to give a good account of how it planned to fight back. The evidence from the last few months suggests Alibaba was able to capture substantial food delivery and quick commerce share while only spending moderately more than Meituan.",

We'd argue it needs to do so, lest the perceived problem facnits shares becomes increasingly existential in the minds of investors. Meituan living up to its promise to \"do whatever it takes\" probably represents the key risk to Alibaba earnings estimates from here. The convergence of e- commerce and food delivery competition still leaves a hyper- competitive market with too many players. But balance sheet strength wins in a fight to the death in this industry, and RMB184bn versus RMB126bn of net cash as of June 2025 argues in Alibaba's favour.",
