Indeed, we see the Czech exchange rates as one of the best expressions of the regime shift in German fiscal and defence policy. 1. Czechia's growth is highly correlated to Germany, and should benefit from spillovers from German fiscal stimulus. 2. The economy already enjoys a strong comparative advantage in defence, and exports of defence equipment are already rapidly increasing. 3. The labour market is close to full employment, meaning stronger growth could translate into wage pressures. 4. Low realised vol offers a great investment opportunity, especially via FX options.",

A stronger domestic demand recovery, along with improved sentiment means that the growth outcome is likely to be stronger than earlier expected, despite the larger US tariffs. That said, still cautious household spending and a difficult external environment, means that we only expect a modest growth recovery this year. We believe that inflation will likely moderate in the next few months due to weak growth, still-tight fiscal policy, absence of wage spiral risks, and weak imported inflation (though upside risk exists from services inflation and high rentals). In our baseline scenario, we do not expect the CNB to ease policy rates further in this cycle. Main risks stem from further escalation in global trade war, as well as escalation in geopolitical tensions. Election due in autumn 2025 also pose a risk. FX weakness and fiscal slippages remain risks to the outlook.Cash bonds: overweightInflation has been coming off from recent peaks, but underlying price pressures remain sticky. Nevertheless, we still like local bonds and continue to expect an outperformance vs core rates in H2. Inflation dynamics should improve further with room to reach 2% by year-end - further supported by our bullish view on FX. ASW-spreads have tightened, however, term-premium in bonds remains high. This is combination with cheap valuation, light foreign positioning and low net supply in H2, provide value for local bonds in our view. On the back of the underperformance vs CEE peers earlier this summer, we have moved from a modest overweight to overweight. We like the SY-7Y part of the curve and think it offers better risk-reward from an outright perspective compared to Polish bonds. Additionally, we continue to like Czech ultra green a very steep curve, and our view of no overshooting on fiscal.Local rates: lowerRecent upside inflation surprises and a hawkish CNB have driven an aggressive bear-flattening of the CZK curve, almost fully pricing out all rate cuts. In turn, we now see an opportunity to re-enter outright receivers. Despite near-term inflation headwinds, we expect inflation to fall back below 2% making cuts still more likely than hikes this year (or next year). We acknowledge the challenges for our call, but we still find risk reward as attractive in short-term recessions.1y1y CZK receivers &amp;amp; long 10Y ASW-spread tighterFX: bullishWe are constructive on CZK given the CNB have signalled another pause, and PMIs are now showing some recovery, even if valuations remain elevated. Czechia should also benefit from German fiscal stimulus and defense spendingshort PLN/CZKHungaryEconomicsGrowth is likely to remain weak this year, due to weak external demand and subdued economic sentiment. Hungary is one of the countries most vulnerable to a global trade shock (due to high exposure to global trade, China, and European manufacturing). Inflation has remained elevated at the beginning of the year, mainly due to food and services repricing. However, declining energy prices and government&#x27;s interventions are likely to lead to more moderate inflation ahead. NBH remains hawkish - and near-term rate easing is unlikely. Renewed disinflation, amidst growth concerns, should allow the central bank to resume rate cuts in 2025, but these are likely to be back-loaded to Q4-25 and early 2026. More persistent inflationary pressures, fiscal shortfalls, and further delays to EU fund flows remain key risks, along with US trade policy shifts and potential escalation in geopolitical conflicts.Cash bonds: strong overweightBonds have seen modest selling pressure this week with concerns about developments in France spilling over into CEE. However, domestically, the fundamentals still look supportive. Disinflation remains on track, although July&#x27;s inflation slightly exceeded consensus expectations (but aligned with DB Economics&#x27; forecast). This trend is underpinned by a strengthening currency, persistent subdued domestic activity data, slowing wage growth and the recent significant drop in oil prices. We anticipate headline CPI falling to 3.5% by year-end, creating scope for gradual monetary easing in late 2025/early 2026. We maintain our bullish strategy view driven by not only supportive fundamentals, but also technicals, attractive steady-state return characteristics, and compelling valuations. Specifically, the market currently prices in a too high terminal rate, foreign positioning remains very light, supply dynamics are well balanced and local bonds offer high term premium, and wide ASW spreads. In addition, real interest rates remain elevated. Our fair value models further reinforce this view, indicating that local assets are undervalued, particularly duration bonds. We maintain a strong overweight, expecting continued outperformance of duration bonds relative to CEE peers, especially Romania. Our year-end target for the 10-year bond yield is 6.25%, compared to the current ~7.0%.Local rates: lowerWe recently shifted from roll-rich curve flattens into outright receivers in 6x9 FRAs and 5y5y. We justify this with our view that all three a) the pace of easing, b) the terminal rate and c) term premium are too hawkish/high-priced - particularly vs CEE peers and core rates. On the back of the recent bull-flattening, the short-end of the curve looks closer to fair with just a few bps left in receivers. On the other hand 5y5y still has much more to go in our view. We target 6.0% in 6x9 FRAs (entry: 6.23) and 6.75% in 5y5y (entry: 7.20).Top trades: 5y5y IRS &amp;amp; 6x9 FRA receiversFX: neutralWe worry about structural risks to HUF (the risk of expansionary fiscal policy into next year&#x27;s election, a very weak growth outlook and a poor relationship with the EU) but there are also some long term upsides, especially if the opposition win in next year&#x27;s election, releasing EU funds. In the near term, we don&#x27;t see catalysts for significant weakness in the next two to three months assuming the NBH stick to an extremely cautious approach.-IsraelEconomicsEconomy experienced a contraction at rate 3.5% saar in Q2 as conflict with Iran in June weighed on investment and consumption. On the other hand, leading indicators in July and onwards, indicate a quick recovery in activity post ceasefire with Iran. While fragile investment confidence and headwinds from global trade tariffs remain as obstacles for growth prospects, we expect recent downshift in conflict to encourage gradual recovery in economy whereas protracted conflict in Gaza should prevent a quick recovery to pre-war trend. Inflation remained above target range at 3.1% YoY as of July. While inflation still remains above target range of the BOI and recent escalation in conflict add further uncertainty to short term prints, we remain constructive on disinflation in H2-2025. As a result, we expect the BOI to resume its easing cycle in H2-25. This expectation is based on lower geopolitical risks and anticipated easing inflationary pressures. We forecast the policy rate at 4.25% by the end of 2025, with a single 25bps cut in H2-2025 though the timing of it will hinge on the course of geopolitical developments.Cash bonds: modest overweightAfter the strong June rally, valuation no longer looks attractive and bonds screen rich compared to fundamental drivers. We still expect price pressures to improve significantly over the upcoming months due to supply-side improvements, lower energy prices, and a gradual economic recovery. The pace of the easing cycle is currently priced in line with our expectations, however, the market is still pricing the terminal rate ~75bps above neutral (3%) which offers value for bonds in the belly. Foreign positioning is less crowded now but has not declined below the long-term average. Overall, we have maintained a constructive outlook and expect decent performance in H2. However, we think the upside potential for Israeli bonds is more limited compared to peers, given recent outperformance leading to rich valuation and concerns about more supply in H2. We maintain a modest overweight but shift from duration into 5Y bonds.Local rates: lowerWe recommend investors shift into outright 5Y IRS receivers on the back of the recent bull-flattening. With the expected start of the easing cycle, we expect outright terminal rate receivers to perform better than curve flattens with further risks to the long-end due to higher fiscal spending in H2.Top trade: receive 5Y ILSFX: structurally bullishWe remain structurally constructive on the shekel, which has shrugged off recent geopolitical developments. Previously, Israel&#x27;s basic balance saw a decline due to record portfolio outflows, despite the current account improving and FDI slowing. But when it comes to foreign flows, we see scope for a recovery given a) positioning is underweight, b) the BoI could move to a looser stance once the current geopolitical tensions ease, encouraging bond inflows c) political developments could turn more favourable again. On the flipside, there is also scope for Israeli institutional investors to add to hedges to US assets.-",

The country&#x27;s more diversified economy and strong EU funds absorption next year make Poland slightly less vulnerable to trade shocks. Inflation is likely to remain close to 3% in H2-2025, allowing the central bank to ease policy rates. We can see policy rate at 4.25% by end-2025 and terminal rate of 3.75% to be reached in Q1-26. The fiscal outlook and potential further slippages this year remain a major risk. Policy uncertainty and friction between President and the government is likely to continue.Cash bonds: modest overweightPolish bonds came under pressure this week on the back of news that the fiscal deficit this year would be higher than planned. However, a softer August inflation print provided some support towards the end of the week. Although bonds are cheap in our models, we still find risk-reward more attractive in ASW-spread tighteners (belly or long-end). Inflation is coming down sharply in Q3 and we expect more monetary policy easing, but both are now well priced in. We remain structurally bullish on the back of sharply falling inflation in H2, light positioning, and attractive steady-state return characteristics as well as cheap valuation vs domestic drivers. We continue to express a modest overweight and see value in both, 5Y &amp;amp; 10Y bonds, but expect an underperformance vs Czech bonds, especially in Q4-25.Local rates: neutralAlthough we find the terminal rate as too divisive, we stay neutral given favorable near-term inflation dynamics and potential more rate cuts in September. Risk-reward remains more attractive in ASW-spreads tighteners rather than outright rates.5Y bonds vs 1y1y IRS payers / 10Y ASW-spreads tightenersFX: bearishWe like tactically selling zloty over the summer. Relatively high interest rates have been crucial in keeping CEE FX relatively insulated from the growth shock of the last three years. But monetary policy divergence will stand out over the next four months, with the NBP likely to continue easing from July. The CNB and NBP are far more cautious, even if real rates are arguably too high in both economies. Second, there is divergence on the flow front as well, with Poland&#x27;s current account tipping back into deficit in the first quarter of this year, while both Hungary and the Czech Republic&#x27;s remain in surplus. We are especially concerned about the marked slowdown in Polish export growth relative to its CEE peers, even more so as Poland should in theory be less sensitive to auto tariffs. Basic balances have favored Poland for the last two years, but with FDI also slowing, this may be over. Finally, Polish fiscal policy is becoming increasingly concerning, with the budget deficit projected to be close to 6% this year, in excess of Hungary&#x27;s.short PLN/CZKRomaniaEconomicsProlonged political uncertainty, and ongoing fiscal consolidation are leading to a slowdown in domestic activity. Indirect tax increases, and expiry of energy price protections will likely lead to sharply higher inflation in the near-term, and prevent the NBR from easing policy until at least H1-26. The approved fiscal consolidation package is positive in terms of scope and targets, and though challenges remain, we think risks of a credit rating downgrade this year has declined. Slow fiscal consolidation and a still-structurally-wide current account deficit, along with potential delays to EU fund inflows and potential credit rating downgrades are the main risks.Cash bonds: neutralWith some of the larger downside risks for Romania likely averted, the outlook has become more balanced. However, we think fundamentals still look challenging, with a still wide fiscal deficit despite improvements and electricity price caps expiring and the VAT hike adding to inflationary pressures. Technicals don&#x27;t look supportive either, especially as supply pressure is likely to remain high following an issuance shortfall in H1 and the authorities continuing to face high financing requirements. Steady-state return characteristics are a mixed bag but ASW-spreads are pretty tight and term premium is very low. Overall, we maintain our neutral stance on Romania and continue to expect underperformance vs Hungary and think a more constructive view on Romania is best expressed in 5Y bonds that we expect to outperform compared to the wings.RussiaFX: neutralRON continues to screen overvalued and structurally a weaker currency would be justified in light of persistent twin deficits. However, more recently momentum has swung into a more supportive direction. The pro-European, centrist parties have been able to form a broad coalition government and a fiscal consolidation package is forthcoming. Additionally, the NBR will likely remain cautious with regard to still sticky headline inflation and high FX pass-through. FX reserves have seen a pronounced decline in May but remain at robust levels and have already started to recover in June. Bringing it all together, we think the direction of travel remains towards further currency weakness but see room for the leu to narrowly outperform forwards into year-end.-EconomicsFundamentals/DriversCEEMEA high-yieldersTop TradesSouth AfricaEconomicsThe US push for peace between Russia and Ukraine quickly ran into difficulties amid still wide differences in minimal war aims and Moscow&#x27;s unwillingness to compromise. We see potential for more constructive talks later in 2025, but this requires greater US pressure on Moscow and/or Ukraine negating Russia&#x27;s military initiative. Russia&#x27;s economy overheated in 2023-24 but is now cooling due to high politics and the fading military Keynesianism boost. Sequential growth has bordered on a downturn in early 2025, though annual growth should remain above 1%. With softer growth and inflation easing from its near 10% peak, the CBR began rate cuts in June (from 21% to 20%) and we see the policy rate falling into 15-16% range by year end. A stronger rule has supported disinflation, but we now see it in overvalued territory, and expect renewed depreciation to emerge by the autumn. If the war continues beyond 2025, lower oil and slowing non-oil revenues would force more painful budget consolidation.EconomicsGrowth forecasts are significantly reduced (0.8% this year, 1.7% in 2026) due to domestic uncertainty and weak external demand. Tentative growth signals are encouraging for Q2, and the latest rate cut should help cement the cyclical recovery. We are yet to get clarity on any tariff deal with the US, but this is likely to prove disinflationary, which with the new aim to anchor inflation at 3% gives scope for another rate cut this year - likely September. We await September MPC, FATF Greylist removal in October, and improving terms of trade to keep confidence on the up. These would be necessary to partly counter the effects of lower prices on nominal GDP and fiscal revenue.Cash bonds: overweightGiven the ongoing outperformance, valuation vs externals as well as fundamentals looks less attractive. Nonetheless, we still expect the rally in local bonds to extend further into H2 on the back of ongoing gradual rate cuts, foreign inflows, stable FX, and well-anchored inflation. However, the game changer for South African fixed income is the change to the inflation target. This should lead to a more cautious SARB in the near-term but open the door for a lower neutral rate, consequently flattening the curve. The outlook for ultra remains challenging given ongoing unfavorable fiscal dynamics, however, the steepness of the 10Y-20Y curve is well reflecting the risks. We have lowered our year-end forecast for 10Y bonds to now 9.4% with room to rally further. Given the steepness of the curve, we recommend investors to move further out the curve and expect flat-flattening with most value in 2040.Long EURZARLocal rates: flatterChanges to the inflation target should not lead to a front-loaded aggressive easing cycle, given rising spot inflation in H2 and inflation expectations not yet anchored at 3%. We therefore expect a gradual further easing cycle but with a significantly lower neutral rate. This should lead to a bull-flattening of the curve. We recommend investors to stay in roll-rich 1y1y-5y5y IRS flatterers as our top trade.Top trade: 1y1y-5y5y IRS flattererFX: tactically bearishWe see scope for some weakness in the rand over the summer. The SARB&#x27;s shift in tone on the inflation target may raise question marks about their reaction function, seasonality is weak over August and positioning is longLong EURZAR",

Concurrently, inflation continued its downward trend, supported by improved inflation expectations, limited exchange rate depreciation, and moderating wage pressures, bringing consumer price inflation to 35.0% in June 2025. Despite potential temporary interruptions from recent market volatility, we anticipate price pressures will ease in the coming months, with exchange rate stability and slowing domestic demand contributing to lower inflation. Although persistent services inflation remains a challenge, we forecast a 29.5% inflation by the end of 2025, primarily driven by a negative output gap, real appreciation in lira, and improved inflation expectations. In response to market volatility in March 2025 and sustained pressure on reserves, the CBT reversed its previous easing cycle hiking its key rate to 46%. We expect the CBT to continue its easing cycle in H2 after 300bps cut in July thanks to falling inflation, stabilization in financial markets and recovery in reserves. We forecast policy rate at 36.0% by year-end, alongside the active use of macroprudential policies to prevent premature easing of financial conditions during the easing cycle.TurkeyCash bonds: strong overweightTurkish bonds have recently outperformed but likely have more to go as we continue to see a number of supportive arguments. The impact of the VaR shock on domestic inflation was limited as we had expected and the latest inflation print is surprised to the downside confirming our constructive view. Additionally, FX reserve levels have started to recover and the situation looks much more stable again. Inflation is expected to further decline in H2 and most likely reach 29%-30%. After the CBT re-started its easing cycle with a 300bps rate cut in July, we expect further easing over the upcoming meetings with room for the key rate to reach 36%-likely offering support to bonds in the belly. Bond supply remains high, however, the Treasury will focus on other financial instruments over the summer. This should provide more room for ASW-spreads to tighten. We keep our strong overweight on local bonds and see most value in 5Y bonds. We justify this with high risk-neutral rates, wide ASW-spreads, gradually falling inflation, and ongoing rate cuts at each upcoming meeting. Positioning remains light and valuation not yet too expensive.FX: bullishHaving stayed on the sidelines over the first four months of this year, we turned bullish again in May. First, there are signs of stabilisation in CBT reserves after a significant drain after the volatility in March. Importantly, most of the drain stemmed from foreign outflows rather than onshore retail demand for dollars, which leaves positioning much cleaner. Second, the summer is supportive for Turkey&#x27;s current account due to tourism revenues. Oil prices should prove another tailwind for an improvement in Turkey&#x27;s current account. Third, carry is back at very attractive levels at just under 50% on a three month (annualised) basis. Diminishing pressure on the currency is illustrated by Turkey&#x27;s cross currency basis which is normalising. Fourth, Turkey is in a strong position from a geopolitical perspective, standing to gain from recent developments in both Russia/Ukraine and the Middle East, with the disbanding of the French Organization (PKK) another meaningful positive.short USD/TRYCountryAsset classFundamentals/DriversTop TradesEgyptFrontier MarketsThe macroeconomic environment has improved significantly this year, laying the groundwork for the country&#x27;s continued recovery. Implementation of reforms has enabled headline inflation to decelerate significantly, although modest pressures persist in relation to the ongoing fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen as the impact from the significant one-off windfall from the UAE deal dissipates. That said, further progress on the divestment of SOEs will help improve the fiscal outlook. The current account deficit is expected to see a modest widening amid import compression and a persistent disruption in the Red Sea, before improving in FY26. Overall, strong tourism inflows, a recovery in remittances, strengthened FX reserves, and renewed investor confidence due to sustained reform momentum are some of the positive factors supporting a positive outlook on Egypt. That said, global and geopolitical risks persist, calling for a careful approach to monetary policy easing and further implementation of structural reforms to continue supporting the Egyptian economy.With our expectation of limited currency weakness this year, local rates should have a lot of room to come down further as the CBE continues its easing cycle. The fiscal deficit in FY24/25 has widened again and will likely keep supply pressure high. Foreigners slightly reduced exposure into year-end, but positioning in t-bills has remained high throughout Q1-25. However, demand for t-bills as well as bonds has held up allowing the authorities to issue above our estimates YTD. Structurally, continued heavy reliance on short-term funding remains a key concern. Additionally, question marks about long-term debt sustainability remain as Egypt faces continued high supply pressure resulting in elevated roll-over risks. In the near-term, still strong external support contributes to the country&#x27;s relative stability, and we continue to see value in Egyptian local markets and still expect attractive vol-adjusted returns by year-end based on DB forecasts. We maintain an overweight expressed in short-dated bonds as liquidity conditions continue to improve. Risk-reward remains less favourable for duration given continued structural constraints (high debt levels, a wide fiscal deficit and potential C/A improvements relying on geopolitics).GhanaAfter initial weakness during the tariff war, EGP has stabilised, with the gap between the parallel market and official rate narrowing. This underscores Egypt&#x27;s resilient macro picture and FX liquidity situation.Short USD/EGPGhanaGhana&#x27;s economic recovery is accelerating, with strong GDP growth projected through 2026, driven by improvements in agriculture, mining, and services sectors. Confidence is at a 7-year high, boosted by successful debt restructuring, a stronger credit, and IMF support. Disinflation is on track, and could yield another 500bps of cuts this year. The external position is expected to improve significantly, with a large current account surplus and rising FX reserves. Fiscal consolidation is underway, though revenue may fall short of government targets, necessitating expenditure rationalization.KazakhstanHigher oil output has so far outweighed the challenging oil price environment and growth started this year on the front foot. Pro-inflationary risks have materialised leading the NBK to deliver a large front-loaded hike in March and more tightening remains a possibility. The tax reform is taking shape and looks on track for implementation in 2026.KazakhstanThe tense has come under pressure again as global market volatility and announcements of an OPEC+ supply ramp-up have led to a sharp decrease in commodity prices posing a headwind to Kazakhstan as a major energy exporter. At the same time, a more hawkish NBK than expected, continued FX sales from the National Fund to support the republican budget (with tax reform and fiscal consolidation only scheduled for 2026), and the gold programme should limit significant further downside.",

The CBN could cut rates by year-end if the naira remains stable as we broadly expect. Targeted government initiatives and a rebounding services sector underpin above- consensus growth, even as it faces near-term challenges. Despite continued oil, we see strong gains in FX reserves from a positive current account position, though capital flows show weakness in portfolio inflows as of Q1. Fiscal policy is likely to disappoint and the offshore debt build up is worrying.UkraineEconomicsHigh labour and energy costs weigh on economic activity as the labour market remains disrupted and energy and civilian infrastructure continues to be targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks. Inflation has further accelerated this year but is expected to move past its peak and decline as a stronger harvest comes in over the summer. This should allow the NBU to return to an easing cycle towards the end of the year.FX:neutralThe hrynia has remained stable despite markets moving away again from initial optimism regarding a quick resolution of the military situation. A key driver is the frontloaded schedule of G7 ERA loan disbursements. While the NBU&#x27;s monthly FX interventions still amount to around USD 2.5bn on a 3mma basis and pressure on reserves is likely to remain high in light of fiscal pressures and a wide trade deficit, the increase in available funds this year will likely allow the NBU to refrain from hrynia depreciation to the extent we initially had penciled in.EconomicsContinued reform progress has resulted in a first credit rating upgrade and reform momentum remains high. Growth rates continue to be strong and inflation has come down on the back of high base effects following last year&#x27;s utility tariff hike. Some room for monetary policy easing could open up later in the year. The fiscal run-rate suggests further improvements after already notable fiscal consolidation last year.UzbekistanFX:bulishStrong growth dynamics and reform progress have contributed to higher portfolio as well as FDI inflows. Coupled with a more narrow current account deficit on the back of higher gold prices and strong inflows of remittances, Uzbekistan&#x27;s basic balance has seen a significant improvement. Additionally, real rates are likely to remain attractive as the CBN is likely to proceed cautiously despite the decline in headline inflation.Short USD/UZSCountryAsset classFundamentals/DriversTop TradesGCCOmanEconomicsOwing to its economic diversification efforts, Oman&#x27;s economy saw a further rebound in 2024, with stronger growth momentum expected as the Sultanate invests further in the manufacturing, tourism, and logistics sectors. Headline inflation in Oman has decelerated significantly and is expected to remain contained below 2%, enabling the CBO to comfortably unwind its monetary policy tightening in line with the Fed&#x27;s cycle. External and fiscal balances are expected to moderate on the back of a less favorable oil environment, before strengthening in the medium term due to continued fiscal consolidation and improved hydrocarbon capacity, respectively. Overall, the authorities&#x27; commitment to reforms, including fiscal consolidation, has resulted in an improved credit rating outlook for the Sultanate. This, in turn, has solidified investor confidence in the country, which we expect will lead to a gradual increase in FDI inflows in the future. In terms of risks, geopolitical instability in the region remains one of the main risks to our outlook this year, although de-escalation efforts, including the announced ceasefire between Israel and Iran, have reduced risk of wider conflagration in the region. Persistent global trade tensions are another risk under consideration, as a potential slowdown in external demand could lead to lower hydrocarbon revenues.Saudi ArabiaEconomicsOverall, the Kingdom&#x27;s macroeconomic environment remains stable, supported by lower inflation and an improved labour market. In addition, despite an underperforming oil sector due to sustained oil production cuts, economic activity rebounded in 2024, with this recovery extending into Q1-25. Going forward, stronger momentum is expected on the back of higher oil production and a robust non-oil sector. As the Kingdom proceeds with its ambitious diversification reforms, however, the fiscal and external position are expected to witness some weakening, including due to lower hydrocarbon revenues and higher import levels, respectively. While we now expect a twin deficit for the Kingdom, the country&#x27;s fundamentals remain strong given the existing fiscal space and external buffers, which could be utilized to weather oil price volatility. Finally, an easing in monetary policy tightening, in tandem with the Fed&#x27;s outlook (i.e., 25bp in 2025 and 50bp in 2026) should help improve the cost of borrowing, further supporting investments. In terms of risks, the latter could stem from a potential decline in global demand and/or inefficient fiscal spending. In our view, however, fiscal discipline is likely to be maintained, containing risks to our outlook at the domestic level. Regionally, however, the recent deterioration in the geopolitical context has led to concerns over potential spillovers to the Saudi economy (GCC more broadly) from wider conflagration in the Middle East. That said, Saudi&#x27;s past (and ongoing) diplomatic push for de-escalation, including with the Houthis and Iran, is expected to keep risks contained for the Kingdom.United Arab EmiratesEconomicsThe macroeconomic environment remains resilient in the UAE, despite global and geopolitical headwinds. Economic activity is expected to see further recovery in 2025-26 on the back of a robust non-oil sector, expanded production capacity, and a reversal in oil production cuts, in line with OPEC+ agreements. Headline inflation is expected to remain contained at around 2%, and monetary policy should see further easing in 2025-26. External and fiscal balances are expected to see some modest normalisation, albeit remaining well anchored in the surplus territory. Overall, strong tourism inflows, higher oil production, and resilient domestic and external demand are some of the positive factors underpinning the country&#x27;s outlook. In terms of risks, a slowdown in global growth (particularly that of China) and oscillation in oil prices are some of the main risks to our outlook. Albeit contained, a broader war in the Middle East could result in some negative spillovers, including through lower external demand and reduced tourism.",

As argued in our preview, the amalgam of domestic, regional, and global developments made this week's meeting an opportune time to opt for a sizable cut, including monthly deflation for two consecutive months, a supportive currency, and contained upside risks (e.g., potential capital outflows in response to geopolitical deterioration). All in all, we keep our view unchanged, expecting an overall rate cut of 725bps this year, with this week's rate leading to a cumulative rate cut of 525bps in 2025, leaving an additional 200bps for Q4. In this report, we highlight key elements from the press release and our monetary policy outlook.",

In addition, in line with our forecast (see our Inflation Monitor here), the CBE expects inflation to average \\(14 - 15\\%\\) in 2025. We flag, however, that the pace of fiscal consolidation around the completion of the IMF's \\(5^{\\text{th}}\\) review (likely in Q4) will be key in determining the magnitude of upside risks to this forecast.

Despite this continued recovery, estimated at \\(- 4.5\\%\\) in FY24/25 (vs. \\(2.4\\%\\) witnessed in FY23/24), the CBE expects demand- side inflationary pressures to remain contained in the short term, supported by the current monetary policy stance that is consistent with the expected disinflation path.

The government's price measures in food, non- food goods and various service sectors have kept a lid on inflationary pressures, and these have now been extended until end- November, in line with our expectations (we in fact expect them to be extended further until at least Q1 next year). Meanwhile, subdued imported inflation and cost dynamics, a declining trend in wage growth, easing labour market tightness (as measured by the job vacancy rate), along with more favourable commodity price dynamics and relative FX strength (despite some weakening recently), should also further support softer inflation ahead (towards c. \\(3.5\\%\\) by year end).",

We have revised the inflation forecasts path higher for the rest of the year on the back of more resilient domestic demand than earlier expected, a decline in trade uncertainty, and stickiness in services inflation. However, we believe that weak imported inflation, subdued industrial producer prices, and ongoing CZK strength are likely to lead to inflationary pressures remaining contained. Meanwhile, favourable commodity price dynamics along with a weaker dollar should lead to lower fuel prices in the Czech Republic. A further electricity and gas price decline is also planned for September (by E.ON), which adds to downside pressures. Volatile food price inflation is a risk to our forecasts - but forward- looking indicators point to softening pressures ahead. Upside pressures stem from accelerating house price inflation feeding through to CPI via both market rentals and imputed rentals costs. However, there are now signs that services inflation, excluding rentals, is beginning to ease from stickier levels. Overall, we believe that headline inflation should moderate to close to the CNB's 2% target in the second half of this year (DBE: +2.2% at end- 2025) (despite upside pressures stemming from house price inflation, still- elevated inflation expectations and stickier services pricing) - before positive growth spillovers from German fiscal spending take effect in 2026.",

Specifically, the effect of the natural gas price increase, which was reflected in the July data, will reverse in August.

The material upward revisions to German GDP growth engendered by the fiscal package earlier this year (our economist forecasts growth of 2% in 2026, a full percentage point above consensus) should therefore be reflected in Czechia's growth outlook.",

Inflation eased further to \\(10.8\\%\\) YoY on aggregate, down from \\(11.1\\%\\) in June. Favourable base effects, stronger exchange rates and their impact on import prices as well as seasonal improvements in food prices encapsulate July's inflation narrative. However, inflation rose in South Africa, Romania, and Uzbekistan, but surprised to the upside in the latter two. In turn, inflation dropped by less than we had forecast in Poland. The impact of administered price adjustments and energy costs emerged as a significant upside driver (see Figure 43) and risk, notably in Romania, South Africa, and Turkiye. Romania saw a sharp acceleration due to the expiry of electricity price protections, leading to a substantial increase in household energy prices. South Africa's inflation was predominantly driven by electricity and higher than expected water tariff escalations, while Poland, despite more favourable base effects, saw a larger- than- expected increase in fuel prices as well as increase in household energy prices due to the reintroduction of a capacity fee. In turn, favourable base effects continued driving down inflation in Egypt, Turkiye, and Ghana (Figure 44). Despite the generally positive narrative, new and/or persistent inflation pressures are starting to become more challenging factors preventing further easing in some markets.",

They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have shorter- term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer- term ratings. Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/), and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company's page. A Catalyst Call represents a high- conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may have a near- term or medium- term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12- month view of total return or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company- specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst's judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and other parties.

      "text": "Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed- rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed- income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis- measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short- dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.",
