Yet initial jobless claims were largely flat through July after adjusting for residual seasonality, and remain at low levels. We consider whether this can be fully explained by low layoffs, which limit eligible individuals, and low unemployment, which reduces the likelihood eligible individuals will file. While a simple model suggests that claims should have risen more than they have, it is difficult to assert with much certainty that claims are \"too low.\" We also wouldn't use low claims to discount the signal from slower job gains just yet, even as we do think some of the slowdown reflects labor supply growth rather than a rise in slack.",

The JOLTS layoff rate only starts in 2001. An alternate CPS layoff rate series from Ellieroth and Michaud starts in 1978, but is highly correlated with the unemployment rate. Neither series materially improves a baseline model that uses just payrolls and unemployment (Table 1). Note that claims might normally be used to predict employment and unemployment, rather than vice versa, but here we are focused on what level of claims we would normally expect given the signal from other labor data.",

The level forecast for July was \\(267\\mathrm{k}\\) , well above the actual level of \\(222\\mathrm{k}\\) . Consequently, we focus on predicted over- year- ago changes in claims. Those predicted increases have recently been moderately higher than the actual increase, though the gap widened in July (Figure 2). But the size of these errors is not unusual, with the root mean squared error of annual changes being close to \\(30\\mathrm{k}\\) . It's thus hard to conclude that the change in claims over the last year is abnormally low. And while adding layoff rates didn't do much to improve the regression fit, it is still possible that low and stable layoff rates have helped keep claims down.",

      "text": "Finally, we consider whether claims provide a reliable signal of a weakening labor market ahead of recessions, which often feature slowing job growth but not an immediate rise in unemployment. In general the answer is \"yes,\" but there is some nuance. Looking at all recessions since the 1970s, claims corroborated the slowing in job growth in the 1973, 1980, and 1990- 91, and 2001 recessions, and to a lesser degree the 1981- 82 recession (Figures 3- 7). Note that series are all normalized, with a one standard deviation change in claims being equal to a \\(\\sim 90\\mathrm{k}\\) change in the monthly average of weekly claims. But while claims rose ahead of unemployment, they sometimes lagged the slowing in job growth, implying we shouldn't take too much comfort from low claims just yet. In addition, while claims led the rise in unemployment at the very end of 2007 by a couple of months (Figure 8), the unemployment rate had already increased \\(0.3\\% - \\mathrm{pt}\\) in the middle of 2007, so arguably in this episode the unemployment rate sent an earlier signal.",
