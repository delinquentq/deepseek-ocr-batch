We believe the company is well positioned to achieve 1) No.1 position in terms of market share (for its main products), rapidly driven by strong R&D and active commercial execution, and 2) additional growth drivers from its emerging products pipeline (incl. contact lens, defocus lens and PIOL). In all, we expect the company to generate earnings CAGR of \\(23\\%\\) in 2024A- 34E driven by increasing penetration, and share gains. We are constructive on 1) its robust market growth for cataract surgery driven by an aging population and IOL upgrade post national VBP, 2) Eyebright's share gains from MNCs based on strong R&D capability, with 3) sales ramp- up from PIOL as key catalyst in 2025E. With the current valuation sitting at a 3- yr historically low P/E, we believe the current share price does not fully factor in the growth opportunities.",

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
