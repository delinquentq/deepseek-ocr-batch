For the Hopper generation, cloud customers deployed multiple racks of servers which included 8 graphics processors (GPUs) each. Within those servers, each GPU could talk to the other, but communicating from server to server required a scale out connection. For Blackwell's NVL72, NVIDIA started implementing fully connected racks, wherein each of the 72 GPUs has a direct line of communication with the other 71, which is very complex to implement but which essentially treats the entire rack as a single virtual GPU, without the server to server connectivity bottleneck in between.
