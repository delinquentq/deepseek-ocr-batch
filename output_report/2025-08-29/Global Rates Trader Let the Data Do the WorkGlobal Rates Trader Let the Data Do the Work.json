This has resulted in a steeper curve than the fundamental picture would typically justify and has sustained the outperformance of belly breakevens. While risks surrounding the future composition of the Fed will likely persist, the busy upcoming data calendar should see the market return its focus to 2025 pricing where the market remains on the hawkish side of our economists' Fed baseline. As a result we continue to favor short expiry receivers on the front- end as a means to navigate event risk, and hold SFRZ5 longs cross market versus ERZ5. OAT- Bund spreads have widened in advance of a confidence vote scheduled for 8 September. We think the market is already pricing in enough premium for deficit deterioration, and that spreads will ultimately tighten unless the risks of fresh elections rise. We also see limited room for spillovers to other sovereign spread markets, or to Bunds - although we do think the risk- reward in Bund swap spread tightening is currently poor. Upcoming inflation data will be key for UK rates, we recommend 2s5s Gilt steepeners given our baseline for deeper cuts, but also for a scenario of data resilience resulting in a combination of shallow cuts and higher terminal rates.",

The combination of an in- line core PCE print and slight upward revisions to Q2 GDP kept 2025 Fed pricing on fairly steady footing this week. A bit further out, however, President Trump's efforts to remove Governor Cook have been a source of additional downward pressure on terminal rate pricing, in turn boosting traded inflation and taking the broader curve to levels that are now meaningfully steeper than warranted by spot macro conditions (especially in 5s30s, which now trades \\(\\sim 60bp\\) steepen than our fair value model conditioned on spot data). We think this risk premia will be hard to dislodge quickly, but headline risks are somewhat two- sided and the bar to further near- term steepening is somewhat higher absent materially weaker macro data. We instead see better risk/reward skewed towards front- end longs heading into next week's heavy data calendar with around 55bp of cuts priced through year- end, and prefer to keep to our recent approach of owning convexity over the key releases.

      "text": "Fed uncertainty leaves clearer footprint on belly inflation pricing. While the response to Fed headlines of front- end and belly nominal rates has been somewhat mixed this week, the outperformance of belly breakevens has been a more consistent expression for concerns around Fed independence. On a beta- weighted basis to nominal rates, 5y inflation swaps continue to reprice towards new post- pandemic highs, and while some of this is attributable to the very front- end fixings, belly forwards (e.g. 2y1y) have also participated. The repricing has taken 5y inflation pricing somewhat \\(\\sim 15bp\\) rich relative to our fair value model, although historically this degree of richness is far from unusual. In contrast, forwards further out the curve have not followed, and in fact 5y5y inflation pricing (on a beta- weighted basis) has remained under pressure in recent weeks (Exhibit 2). This suggests that at least so far, the market is embedding some risk of higher inflation over the next few years but is hesitant to reprice longer- term inflation risk premium higher, driving the real curve sharply steeper. For this inflation risk premium to be priced further out the curve may require evidence of more persistent underlying spot inflation, or evidence that the Fed becomes structurally more tolerant of inflation upside. But for now, we continue to view belly inflation longs as a more reliable hedge for Fed uncertainty.",

Major opposition parties have stated their intention to vote against the PM, making it likely that Bayrou will need to step down following the vote. The willingness and ability of any future government to carry out budget consolidation will be the key input for the path taken by OATs, in our view. We see reasons to expect contained volatility, however. In particular, deficit expectations — close to 5.5% for 2026 — already aim well off the current government objective of 4.6%, suggesting the market is already pricing substantial slippage vs target. Valuations are also less stretched vs macro and fiscal factors — OATs now screen as fair against peers based on debt levels (Exhibit 3). We have maintained our year-end target for the 10y OAT-Bund spread at 70bp, but see risks tilted towards wider spreads, especially if fresh parliamentary elections become a more central case to the market.",

Ongoing declines in rates volatility help to contain risks to other sovereign spread markets. And there has been limited richening in Bunds vs swaps compared with during last year's snap elections (Exhibit 4). We see two explanations. First, as above, political uncertainty in France has not reached the same level as last year, with parliamentary elections likely not yet widely expected and less speculation about President Macron resigning. In the same vein, markets may be drawing some comfort from having witnessed the relatively smooth transition from the Barnier to the Bayrou government last November. Second, with the ECB cutting cycle now over, German fiscal easing underway, and a more challenging duration backdrop globally, the prospect of substantial Bund outperformance is dimmer. We continue to expect Bunds to cheapen, both in outright terms and against swaps. That said, to the extent that we expect the cheapening in Bunds vs swaps to be gradual, the increased tail risk in France and lack of reaction in swap spreads so far diminish the risk reward for tighteners, in our view.",

BoE Governor Bailey repeated the risk of inflation persistence, and the concern that low productivity growth and labour supply weakness necessitates restrictive policy. At the same time, ongoing weakening on the demand side of the labour market is a reminder of the downside skew of risks to the policy rate. We believe that disinflation in 2H25 will ultimately allow for deeper BoE cuts, but the onus is for the upcoming inflation data to give signs that inflation persistence is fading (the next inflation release comes on September 17). Given our base case for deeper cuts, as well as the possibility that terminal rate expectations may be revised higher if data remains resilient, we see the risks skewed towards further curve steepening. In particular, we recommend Gilt 2s5s steepeners, which scan as flat vs macro factors (Exhibit 6) (more so than swaps in our models), either for a scenario of deeper cuts or upward revision of belly (terminal) rates amid shallower cuts (Entry: 16bp, Target: 40bp, Stop: 2bp).",

      "text": "Core ViewsRecommendationEntry DateDurationWith growth pricing remaining firm, inflation pricing to the hawkish side of our economists baseline, and the market-implied policy path resetting to our economists&#x27; baseline but with balance of risks remaining to the downside, we see a more constructive backdrop for US duration. We think near-term risks are asymmetric to downside surprises in activity data.Long 1m2y USD Receivers29-Aug-25We expect European duration to trade weaker over time with our updated end-25 10y Bund yield forecast sitting at 3.0% (and 3.25% at end-2026). This is because we believe the front-loaded fiscal boost out of Germany will push yields higher on improving growth expectations, and compensation for increasing bond supply.Long SFRZ5 vs ERZ58-Aug-25The improved macro outlook should over time compress risk premium throughout the Gulf curve, and see 10y Gilts rally towards our YEE forecast of 4.25%. US spillovers and lower global duration demand present upside risks to yields, but accelerated BoE cuts on the back of inflation normalisation counterbalance them.----CurveWe expect the BOJ normalization cycle to be prolonged, with a medium-term neutral rate of 1.25-1.5%. This should lift yields across the curve, although in the near-term rising US recession risk presents a headwind to this view. Reduction in BOJ&#x27;s JGB holdings should put most upward pressure on belly yields.----BoC cut pricing has converged towards our economists forecasts, but potential for earlier cuts and spillovers from the US leave some (albeit more limited) room for pricing to build from here.Receive Sept 2025 BoC Meeting OIS22-Aug-25Reemerging tariff - and thus, growth - concerns bias yields lower in the near term, as Riksbank is likely to ease further to contain labour market risks. Higher defence spending and hence, issuance, however biases duration higher further out and points to continuing steepening in the SEK curve.----CurveThe path to substantially lower yields by and large rests on hard data deterioration but yields could settle into a modestly richer range if inflation data provide additional evidence of mild pushthrough from tariffs, which would likely support a friendlier demand backdrop. We think it makes sense to navigate the data calendar tactically, recognizing that hard data can open the left tail towards faster/larger cuts, which we think would sustain sharper front-end outperformance. 20s appear to still be embedding elevated term premium and risk, with room for relaxation on both fronts.Long 20s on 10/20/30s weighted SOFR fly (weights 0.6x : 2x : 1.4x)1-Aug-25As the ECB suggests a more benign reading of tariff risks from here, pouring cold water on the prospects of cuts in 2025, markets can look beyond the valley of near term growth weakness. Beyond, as above, we expect the fiscal boost from Germany to support a steeper curve from here, especially when combined with ECB QT. This is also true for SZ27 where our economists&#x27; forecasts for growth and inflation are consistent with additional hike risk premium.Long 3m2y A-25 receiver vs sell 3m5y A-25 receiver8-Aug-25Downside risks to the market-implied path for Bank Rate, which remains above our economists&#x27; baseline, implies steepening risks in 2s10s. However, the improved macro outlook should over time allow investors to price out excessive risk premium at the long end, and we expect the 10s30s Gulf curve to flatten.Gilt 2s5s Steepeners29-Aug-25SpreadsWe see less room for the SEK front-end to outperform in the near-term, as much easing is already priced. As long as the Norges Bank is holding onto their hawkish guidance the NOK curve has no room to steepen much, so we would await the eventual pivot towards growth before engaging again.----The recent global bond selloff has seen 30y JGBs clearly underperforming both its beta to USTs as well as on a relative basis to other curve points. We think there is room for 10s30s JPY curve to unwind some of the recent steepening as liquidity conditions normalize, while any discussion of continued BOJ QT could put further pressure on the belly of the JGB curve.----The upcoming TGA rebuild post debt limit poses upside risk to funding spreads, but swap spreads appear to embed sufficient risk premium against this.----VolWe continue to be positive on sovereign credit going into the summer, given the resilience of the asset class in recent months and the possibility of portfolio flows into EGBs, but tight valuations and a smaller carry cushion make further sovereign spread compression more difficult. In light of the relative political calm and improved debt dynamics in Italy, we have upgraded our view on BTPs. In contrast, we think France remains the idiosyncratic story to watch, though we believe widening risk will be clearer in the fall when budget negotiations are in full swing.----We expect continued Bund spreads tightening as ECB QT increases the Bund free-float and repo costs drift higher. Though constrained German issuance is a risk, we think it is manageable and unlikely to derail the tightening trend, especially as France and the EU continue to issue heavily.----Though Gulf spread tightening has run some way, we think the trend can extend as the BoE remains intent on shrinking its balance sheet, and fiscal policy remains accommodative.----VolA relatively benign macro environment should be conducive for implied risk to reset lower, but trade uncertainty and tariff risks may act as an impediment to how far this reset can go, with increases in trade policy uncertainty generally corresponding to higher vol levels. Implied vols on 10y tails have lagged the rest of the tail curve in the April vol spike, driven by push-pull factors from deeper Fed cuts vs term premium reset.----Curtailed tail-risks have narrowed the range of outcomes for the EUR front end, and gamma has fallen substantially. Given the ongoing risks of tariff related growth scares, and the recent repricing, we view the outlook for gamma as more balanced. News about the German fiscal expansion, which we expect over summer, create near term event risks.----We expect elevated coupon issuance to be absorbed in large part by levered investors, with the resulting leverage demand likely to pressure financing spreads wider. We expect repo rates to continue drifting higher relative to OIS and bill yields.----MarketWhile high frequency measures still point to relatively abundant liquidity, we see the upward trend in overnight repo spreads to IOR as indicative of the system moving from abundant to ample. We expect the Fed to end QT in September; the debt limit presents a source of volatility through this process.----Inflation forwards have compressed by more than justified by growth and policy reassessments. Relaxation about growth concerns could see belly forwards reprice higher, from already low valuation levels.----InflationWith pricing in Europe already below the ECB&#x27;s target out to the belly of the HICP curve, we see limited scope for a sell-off in inflation swap, although the recent stabilisation in energy prices may pose some modest pressure on breakaways. Instead, we think nominal rates will be pushed lower by the real component of rates, as markets price more ECB support to the economy through rate cuts.----",
