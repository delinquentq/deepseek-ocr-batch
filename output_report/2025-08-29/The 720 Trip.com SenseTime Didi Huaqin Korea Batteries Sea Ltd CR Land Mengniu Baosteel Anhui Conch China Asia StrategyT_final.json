Given the healthy travel momentum in 2Q25 esp. during the May Labor Day holidays, TCOM delivered another solid set of results as flagged in our preview note (Aug 7), beating its rather conservative revenue and margin guidance. Specifically, group revenue grew steadily \\(+16\\%\\) yoy (vs. \\(+16\\%\\) yoy in 1Q25 and toward the high- end of its \\(12 - 17\\%\\) yoy guidance) again driven by strong growth from its international Trip.com platform and resilient performance from both domestic and outbound travel. EBIT came in \\(+9\\%\\) above consensus estimates \\((+4\\%\\) above GSE) and rose \\(+10\\%\\) yoy to Rmb4.7bn, implying - 1.7pts yoy margin contraction to \\(31.4\\%\\) narrowed from - 4pts/2.4pts yoy in 4Q24/1Q25 and ahead of \\(- 29\\%\\) guided mainly due to lower- than- expected marketing expenses. Additionally, the company announced today that the board has authorized a new share repurchase program up to US \\(5bn (representing 11\\%\\) of its market cap). We increase 12m TPs to US \\(87/HK\\) 679. Simon Cheung",

The rally has manifested against a backdrop where macro statistics are showing signs of cyclical softness and consensus profit revisions are muted, prompting investor questions about the durability of this liquidity- driven rally. We note that \"liquidity\" has boosted equity returns globally, and with (i) China equity multiples at mid- range levels, (ii) trend profit growth running at high- single- digit pace, (iii) A- share retail risk appetite only moderately above neutral territory on our measures, (iv) far- from- extended fund positioning across investor types, and (v) strong potential for asset reallocation flows to equities, we believe the uptrend has legs notwithstanding near- term profit taking pressures.

We believe this is reflected by the launch of its VIP subscription program and a general push towards faster deliveries.

We also remain confident in DiDi's leading technology stack (with approved licenses in remaining Tier 1 cities, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen) and maintain it positions the company amongst the top tier robotaxi fleet developments.
