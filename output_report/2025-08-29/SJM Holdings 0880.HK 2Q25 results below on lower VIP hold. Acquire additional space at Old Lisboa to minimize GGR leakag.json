From our channel checks, we understand that SJM's GGR market share slipped again to below \\(12\\%\\) so far in Aug after bouncing back to \\(12.8\\%\\) in July (vs. \\(12.3\\%\\) in 2Q25), although GLP has performed better vs. satellite casinos in general. Most of the questions at the call were related to its strategies to minimize GGR/EBITDA leakage upon the closure of its satellite casinos by the end of this year, esp. since the group has received confirmation from the government to take back all 440 gaming tables there. The additional cost they will have to bear by taking over the \\(\\sim 3k\\) staff working at these satellite casinos are sunk costs. Other than its earlier announcement to acquire 2 out of its 9 satellite casinos in Peninsula, i.e., Casino L'Arc Macau, Casino Ponte 16 (see our report on Jun 11), the group also announced after the market closed on Aug 28th (link) that it will acquire additional space totaling \\(7.5k\\) sqm at Old Lisboa from its parentco STDM for a total consideration of HK\\$529mn - their intention, per the announcement, is for the group to house some of the gaming tables taken back from the satellite casinos. For context, SJM currently owns 1/16 of Old Lisboa for its existing gaming area and the remaining 15/16 is controlled by STDM. According to management, they plan to double its gaming table capacity by installing \\(\\sim 80\\) gaming tables in the new area. If we assume each table generates similar US\\$8k daily revenue as those currently in operation at Old Lisboa, they together could generate \\(\\sim US\\$230mn\\) or HK\\$1.9bn annualized GGR or \\(0.7\\%\\) GGR market share. Netting out gaming tax, promotional allowance, staff and other fixed costs (some of which are sunk costs), we estimate up to \\(\\sim HK\\$0.5bn\\) in potential EBITDA accretion based on company guidance. Assuming successful execution on the announced terms, we see strategic merit in this proposed acquisition. However, we see risks to potential returns SJM could realize from the acquisition of the two satellite casinos (L'Arc and Pone 16) which could cost up to HK\\$3- 6bn when benchmarked with the valuation of adjacent properties (HK\\$ 20- 40k/sqm) as discussed in our prior report (Jun 11). Exhibit 3 lays out the EBITDA impact to the group depending on how much GGR market share it can retain out of the approximately \\(5\\%\\) share these 9 satellite casino used to generate. Our analysis suggests that SJM could break even for as long as it retains more than \\(\\sim 2\\%\\) GGR market share - we model \\(2.3\\%\\) translating to HK\\$4.7bn EBITDA in FY26E. Our forecast does not factor in any incomplete transactions.",

Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for specific metrics for each stock.

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
