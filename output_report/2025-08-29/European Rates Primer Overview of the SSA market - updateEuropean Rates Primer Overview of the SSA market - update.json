This allows them to broaden their investor base and take advantage of attractive funding opportunities.",

With Quantitative Tightening now under way, the ability and willingness of other investors to now absorb the growing net supply will be important for market pricing and relative valuations.",

Their capital base typically consists of paid- in capital by shareholders. In almost all cases, this is further supported by callable capital that the supranational can obtain if needed (with some exceptions). The joint ownership by governments and often substantial capital base, including the callable capital, typically results in strong perceived credit worthiness. Additionally, their issued debt tends to qualify as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) level 1 under LCR (exceptions exists).",

If a loan beneficiary country doesn't service its debt (which has never happened to date), the EU budget guarantees that the EU timely honours its own interest payments / debt repayment obligations. To this end, the Commission can make available its cash buffer, re-prioritise budgetary expenditure and, if needed, draw additional resources from member states, using the budgetary margin available. Ultimately, member states will be liable if the EU budget is insufficient. As a result, the EU has a high rating (AAA/AA+) and is generally able to fund itself at lower rates than most European Union governments, allowing it to lend to sovereigns at more attractive levels than the sovereign's funding rates in the market.",

Euro Area SSAs were included in the purchase programmes, and considerable amounts of supply was thus taken out of private investors hands. Supply net of redemptions and QE flows, which equals the net supply that needs to be absorbed by private investors each year, was thus very low and often negative during the years of ECB's QE program. However, as the ECB has now stopped re-investing maturing debt, this trend is reversing, and net supply is instead reaching record highs as the EU also ramped up its issuance over the last few years. As the ECB only purchased bonds denominated in EUR, this large variation in net supply is a EUR bond story.",
