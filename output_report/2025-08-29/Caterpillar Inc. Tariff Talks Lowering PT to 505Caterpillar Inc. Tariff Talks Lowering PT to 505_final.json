As a result, it now expects its operating margin to be in the bottom half of its target range. Note that its expectations for revenues remain unchanged. We are lowering our estimates with 2025/26 EPS now at\\) \\ \\(18.13\\) and \\(\\) 20.00\\(, respectively. Our Dec 25 PT is now lower by\\) \\ \\(15\\) to \\(\\) 505\\$ based on \\(\\sim 25x\\) FY1 PE. We rate CAT Overweight. The latest tariff guidelines, especially regarding the value of steel and aluminum in a broad range of imported components and finished products, are not an idiosyncratic risk to CAT and will impact most industrial companies in our coverage that have a global supply chain. The long- term impact on sales, market share, and margins remains to be seen based on what the 'new normal' will look like in terms of reciprocal tariffs, who has pricing power, and who will be able to flex their global supply chain. We caught up with management today and below are the key highlights.",

On August \\(19^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) , the Department of Commerce issued new guidance based on Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Section 232) that will apply to the steel and aluminum content in a broad range of components and products. A \\(50\\%\\) tariff rate will now be applied to the value of steel and aluminum in those categories. This is accountable for the vast majority of the up- sized tariff headwind announced by CAT yesterday. Large machinery, including excavators and combines, will now be assessed based on the value of the steel and aluminum content within them and be tariffed at \\(50\\%\\) , while the non- steel or non- aluminum content will face the existing reciprocal tariffs for the specific country of origin. In simple terms, there will now be layers of tariffs when a product or component is imported into the US. Furthermore, reciprocal tariffs on imports from India also went up to \\(50\\%\\) , which is also embedded in the updated guide from CAT.",

Some levers, such as pricing, have long- term impacts and hence will be carefully evaluated before implementation. Our sense is that management is likely waiting for policy stability before implementing long- term changes, including list price increases and adjusting the supply chain.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
