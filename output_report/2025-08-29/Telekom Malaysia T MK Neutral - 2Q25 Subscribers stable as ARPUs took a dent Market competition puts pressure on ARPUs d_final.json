Its subscriber base increased marginally (up \\(0.1\\% q - q\\) and up \\(1.4\\% y - y\\) ) to 3.2mn, while ARPU dropped to MYR125 (MYR128 in 2Q24 and MYR127 in 1Q25). According to management, given the intensifying competition in the industry, TM rolled out promotional discounts to retain subscribers and to match the aggressive competition. The current MSAP runs through 2023-2025, and the upcoming revision will apply from 2026-2028. We believe there is a possibility that broadband prices may be lowered further by the government. This, we think, could further add to the pressure on ARPUs amidst the rising competition in the market.- The enterprise business (B2B) segment posted revenue of MYR670.8mn, down \\(9.4\\% y - y\\) and flat q-q. Management reported that TM One's (unlisted) key projects are scheduled for completion in 2H25E, and there were one-offs in 2024. However, it notes positive momentum in connectivity-related offerings, such as cloud services and ICT solutions. Other highlights are mentioned in the next section.",

On the local front, management confirmed that operations are progressing as planned, with ongoing data centre expansions and the deployment of 5G mobile backhaul infrastructure to support the national 5G network rollout (note).- In terms of revenue by product, the downtrend in voice revenue continued, in line with the global trend. Revenue from voice was down \\(6\\%\\) y-y and flat q-q. Revenue from data was down \\(9\\%\\) y-y and \\(6\\%\\) q-q, while revenue from internet was down \\(3\\%\\) y-y and flat q-q.- The total cost-to-revenue slightly improved, coming in at \\(79.4\\%\\) for the quarter vs \\(81.7\\%\\) in 1Q25 and \\(81.1\\%\\) in 2Q24. This was primarily due to lower manpower and depreciation costs. TM incurred capex of MYR822mn in 1H25 (14.6% of revenue vs \\(8\\%\\) in 1H24), mainly for fibre rollout, 5G mobile back haul project and data centre expansion.- The company currently has a strong cash balance of MYR2.2bn which is down from MYR2.6bn as of June 2024. This is because management is actively repaying debts. The net debt/EBITDA is down to 0.66x vs 0.89x in June 2024.",
