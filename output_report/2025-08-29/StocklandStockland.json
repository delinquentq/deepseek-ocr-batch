Investors and builders are leading demand, with owner occupiers likely to follow, as typically happens.- SEQ - saw further strength in the market over the final quarter of FY25 and this has carried into the start of FY26.- Sydney - solid performance despite lack of affordability, minimal FHB (less than 10%). Limited supply and price growth running at \\(\\sim 3\\) to \\(5\\%\\) .- Perth - peaked \\(\\sim 12\\) months ago, moderated but has seen renewed price and volume in the last quarter, assisted by rate cuts.- Lendlease portfolio acquisition - is performing better than expected (terms agreed Dec-23) with price growth and sales volume (ex Vic) running ahead of original feasibilities.- MCP guidance (7,500-8,500 lot settlements in FY26) implies \\(\\sim 1,900\\) net deposits a quarter to get to the bottom end of its settlement target.- Apartments - over the long-term, Sydney has been the best performing residential market in Australia, and Stockland wants to have exposure to this market. There are limited MPC opportunities in Sydney with mostly brownfield opportunities requiring apartment development. SGP is trying to secure capital-efficient sites and will look to bring in capital partners prior to commencing construction on its apartment projects.- Land lease - Stockland sees its capital employed at about the right level for land lease. It aims to lift FY25's 530 settlement to 700-800 in FY26 and to \\(\\sim 1,000\\) over the medium term. Stockland would be unlikely to look at LIC as it doesn't like DMF.- Kingscliff - Stockland has acquired a \\(\\sim 857\\) ha site with approval for \\(\\sim 4,500\\) homes near Kingscliff in northern NSW from Leda Holdings. Press suggested a price of \\(\\sim \\$ 620\\) . Stockland noted it was a multi-stage payment for the project, with the first payment due on Jul-26. The price paid includes the first \\(\\sim 350\\) lots which are already developed, and Stockland is very optimistic about the project, noting strong demand and limited nearby supply.",

Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.",
