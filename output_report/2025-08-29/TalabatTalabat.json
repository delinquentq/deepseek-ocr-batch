      "text": "Over the last few days we have seen a number of developments which, in our opinion, send a mixed read- across for Talabat. Meituan 2Q25 profit miss on negative effects of competition prompted JPM analyst Alex Yao to re- assess the long- term profitability in the China food delivery vertical from \\(3\\%\\) to \\(1\\%\\) EBIT margin as \\(0\\%\\) of GTV and cut rating from OW to Neutral (link), which underscores that the effect of new competitors with deep pockets in the food delivery sector could be more disruptive in the initial stages. However, it also likely implies less appetite from Meituan to increase investment in international markets in the near- term, notwithstanding the long- term commitment - a potential positive for Talabat, in our view. Delivery Hero's (OW, covered by Marcus Diebel) MENA GMV growth (ex Talabat) in 2Q25 decelerated vs. 1Q25 with EBITDA/GMV in negative territory for 1H25, also underscoring the negative effect of Keeta's aggressive push in Saudi on the incumbent's margins. Albeit we are still confident in Talabat maintaining their leadership position and attractive unit economics in the long run even with Keeta likely entering their markets of operation in 2H25- 2026, the results from Meituan and DH underscore that BBerg consensus for Talabat's EBITDA and FCF, in our opinion, looks increasingly at risk (JPM 5% more conservative). We see up to \\(14\\%\\) downside risk to the Street's forecasts in case Talabat needs to aggressively defend market share and is not able to add incremental EBITDA in 2026.",

      "text": "- HungerStation's growth in Saudi is stable, however EBITDA was negative in 2Q25. Based on Delivery Hero, Talabat and Instashop disclosures, we estimate that Delivery Hero's operations in Saudi (HungerStation) and Turkiye saw \\(18\\%\\) y/y GOV growth in 2Q25, decelerating from \\(30\\%\\) y/y in 1Q25, partly due to the negative FX impact in Turkiye. Management noted that HungerStation orders in KSA grew by \\(20\\%\\) y/y in 2Q25, broadly in-line with the 1Q25 trend. We estimate that Saudi and Turkiye segments' adj. EBITDA was a negative EUR 28mn (Fig 1) with the loss widening from JPM e EUR 8mn loss in 1H24 on the back of investments in logistics capabilities in Turkiye and investment in Saudi due to competitive pressure (DH management commented the EBITDA loss in Saudi being limited to low double digit EUR mn). It thus appears to us that competition with Keeta does have a near-term negative impact on HungerStation's profitability in Saudi with some weakness in the low value customer segment that Keeta is targeting, albeit nowhere near to what Meituan experienced in China. On the positive side, Delivery Hero stated during the results call that they do not intend to reduce their holdings in Talabat, which we expect to alleviate some of investor concerns.",

The level of margin erosion seen in China food delivery showcases that competition does bring a significant near- term disruption for the market leader Meituan despite its strong network effect. Additionally, China's market favors the volume leader due to low order sizes, meaning a decline in market share by volume could disproportionately impact profit margins (see comments from Alex Yao here). This scenario, however, might not fully apply to the MENA region, as evidenced by HungerStation's 1H25 performance, and the incumbents seem more rational in their response to the new entrant; however, we see up to \\(14\\%\\) downside risk to the Street's forecasts in the case Talabat needs to aggressively defend market share and is not able to add incremental EBITDA in 2026.",
