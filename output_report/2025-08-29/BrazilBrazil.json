July's consolidated public sector reported a primary deficit of BRL 66.6 billion, exceeding our forecast of BRL 64.0 billion and the somewhat more optimistic BRL 60.6 billion median consensus (Figure 1). The central government, regional governments, and state- owned enterprises posted deficits of BRL 56.4 billion, BRL 8.1 billion, and BRL 2.1 billion, respectively. Over the past 12 months, the sector accumulated a primary deficit of BRL 27.3 billion, or \\(0.22\\%\\) of GDP, compared to a surplus of BRL 17.9 billion ( \\(0.15\\%\\) of GDP) in the 12 months up to June. With higher interest rates, nominal interest payments amounted to BRL 109.0 billion, contributing to an increase in the nominal deficit to BRL 175.6 billion, with a 12- month total of \\(7.86\\%\\) of GDP versus \\(7.30\\%\\) of GDP in June 2025 (Figure 2 and 3). Net debt for the public sector rose to \\(63.7\\%\\) of GDP despite a \\(2.7\\%\\) currency depreciation observed in the month, while gross debt reached \\(77.6\\%\\) of GDP, increasing by 0.9 percentage points from the previous month (Figure 4).",

      "text": "Signs of days to come. Today's result, contrasting with the BRL 21.3 billion registered in the same period of 2024, is sobering. One can argue that there is a simple explanation for it: the government paid over BRL 65 billion in court- ordered- debt last month, while the equivalent disbursements happened earlier in the last fiscal year. This discontinuity was one of the reasons why real expenditures grew so much in 1H24, and, together with lower execution on discretionary expenses, helps explain why real growth in spending turned negative during 1H25 (Figure 5). Still, the seasonality discussion does not change the fact that the deficit is expected to trend higher over coming months, not lower. All considered, we remain of the view that between accelerating expenses and decelerating revenues, the government will still be able to deliver results consistent with the fiscal target in 2025 (Figures 5 to 7 and Table 1). But this entails some execution risk between now and the end of the year in case monthly results continue to surprise marginally to the downside, adding pressure to the September 22 fiscal review.",
