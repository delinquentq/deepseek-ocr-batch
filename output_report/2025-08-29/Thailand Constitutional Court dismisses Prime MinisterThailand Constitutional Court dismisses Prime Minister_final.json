      "text": "Bottom line - The Constitutional Court's dismissed Thai Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, for \"ethics violation\" involving the leaked audio recording of her conversation on June 15 with Hun Sen, the former President of Cambodia. The next steps would be for the Lower House to elect a new Prime Minister. We note that last year, when the Constitutional Court dismissed the then Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on 14th August, the parliament vote took place 2 days later on 16th August. We would therefore expect that a Lower House vote is likely to take place within the coming week. Meanwhile, Phumtham Wechayachai of the Pheu Thai Party has been serving as acting Prime Minister since Paetongtarn was suspended in July 2025.",

      "text": "Policy and market implications - If there is a smooth transition to a new Prime Minister, similar to that in August 2024, then we do not expect there to be any significant policy changes or impact on the economy. The new Bank of Thailand governor, Vitai Ratanakorn, has already been selected by the cabinet and is to assume his new role on 1st October. He has been openly dovish in calling for lower rates, and the market is pricing in around 50bp worth of cuts in this cycle, in line with our forecasts. We do not expect his stance to change, whoever assumes the Prime Minister's role. The 2026 budget is currently in process (new fiscal year starts on 1st October), and as long as it is approved by the Lower House, then we do not expect there to be any delay in the implementation.",
