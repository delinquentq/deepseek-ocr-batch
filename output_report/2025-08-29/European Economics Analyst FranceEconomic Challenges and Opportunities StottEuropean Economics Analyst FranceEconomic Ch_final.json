Tax revenues in France are skewed towards labour taxation, with taxes on wage income and social contributions amounting to \\(60\\%\\) of total tax revenues (Exhibit 13). In contrast, corporate income and consumption taxation (such as VAT) represent a smaller share of tax revenues than in other developed countries. Recent policy proposals have included funding a cut in social contributions with a VAT increase, increasing the progressivity of inheritance taxation, and levying a wealth tax on ultra- high net worths.",
