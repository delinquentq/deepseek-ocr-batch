Lower prices for cocoa and stable prices for sugar should benefit F&B companies in Malaysia by lowering production costs. Major Malaysian F&B companies include Farm Fresh (FFB MK, Buy), Nestle Malaysia (NESZ MK, Not rated), F&N (FNH MK, Not rated) and Apollo Food (APOF MK, Not rated). We believe the continued decline in wheat and corn prices on a y- y basis should reduce input costs for companies such as QL Resources (QLG MK, Buy) and Farm Fresh. WMP prices have started to increase, but we think Farm Fresh's margins would be protected as it has adequate supply through Dec- 2025 and plans to lower its dependence on whole milk powder (WMP) for milk from 50% to 25- 30% going forward. Sharp m- m increase in coffee prices could impact margins for coffee suppliers and café operators. Major coffee suppliers in Malaysia include Nestle and café operators include Oriental Kopi (KOPI MK, Not rated) and Zus Coffee (unlisted).",

MR DIY (MRDIY MK, Neutral) saw a marginal increase in revenue and net profit by \\(2\\%\\) y- y each despite continued store expansion and higher gross margins with FY26F consensus revenue and net profit being lowered due to expectations of weaker sales growth (see our 13 August report - Weaker- than- expected 2Q on sharp SSSG decline). QL Resources (QLG MK, Buy) saw a slight decline in consensus FY26F estimates on weaker 1Q26 results along with concerns over the egg price subsidy removal and slower growth for the company's convenience store business (see our 27 August report - Weak 1Q26, but outlook improving). Consensus estimates for Farm Fresh (FFB MK, Buy) were relatively stable following strong set of 1Q26 results on the back of margin expansion (see our 28 August report - Gross margins to remain at \\(\\sim 32\\%\\) in FY26/27F).",

Padini (PAD MK, Not rated)'s FY26E consensus estimates were lowered following the lowest 4Q25 net profit reported in the past 16 years amid concerns over lower spending from the core M40 population. Estimates for Carlsberg Brewery (CAB MK, Not rated) and Heineken Malaysia (HEIM MK, Not rated) were lowered due to concerns over potential tax increases on alcoholic products in Malaysia, in our view.",
