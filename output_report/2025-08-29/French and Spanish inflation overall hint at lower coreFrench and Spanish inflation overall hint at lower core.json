      "text": "According to preliminary CPI releases, French core inflation declined \\(0.3\\% - pt\\) to \\(1.4\\%\\) oya while Spanish core inflation (which includes processed food) inched up a tenth to \\(2.4\\%\\) oya. The outcome, on balance, is broadly aligned with our view that Euro area HICP core inflation will decline in August, from \\(2.3\\%\\) oya to \\(2.1\\%\\) . The details at hand show that the decline in French core inflation was skewed towards services (down \\(0.4\\% - pt\\) to \\(2.1\\%\\) oya) and the statistics office mentioned the role of transport prices. The French data show a rise in energy price inflation and the Spanish press release commentary echoed this outcome by highlighting a rise in electricity price inflation in August. This overall left French headline CPI inflation down a tenth to \\(0.9\\%\\) oya while Spanish CPI inflation was stable at \\(2.7\\%\\) oya. Similar headline outcomes were released at the HICP level without details. The lower level of French headline inflation compared to Spain is partly linked to a \\(12.6\\% /m\\) decline in regulated electricity prices in February (a \\(0.4\\% - pt\\) drag on headline inflation). Spanish inflation, meanwhile, has been standing above the rest of the region due to services and energy price inflation. Additional country data will be released today (Italy and Germany) ahead of the Euro area print on Tuesday.",
