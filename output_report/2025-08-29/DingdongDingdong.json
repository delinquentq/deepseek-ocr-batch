Its share price has dropped \\(35\\%\\) YTD (vs KWE \\(^{+28\\%}\\) ), due to concerns about intensifying competition from large internet platforms in the quick commerce market. While we acknowledge Dingdong's differentiation through owned supply- chain and private- label products, we still see risks of its growth slowing down in coming quarters with margin pressure due to more competition for traffic. Such financial risks should translate into more discount on its valuation, in our view. We maintain UW with a new Jun- 26 PT of US \\(1.6, based on 7x 2025E P/E,\\) in line with Vipshop, as we think Dingdong will also face concerns about growth as a niche player against large peers.",

While the focus is on food delivery now, the eventual goal is to grow their shares in the quick commerce market, in our view. While these large platforms focus mainly on a 3P model (i.e. connecting consumers to offline retailers), they are also increasing investments in the 1P model, which competes with Dingdong: Meituan's Xiaoxiang Supermarket has set up nearly 1,000 front warehouses in 20 cities with continuous investments aiming to cover all tier-1/-2 cities, which will inevitably compete more with Dingdong. Alibaba and JD are also investing more in the grocery business (both online and offline).",

Dingdong's GMV/revenue grew \\(4.5\\% /7\\%\\) YoY in 2Q25, the slowest rate since 1Q24, with adjusted operating margin improving slightly YoY to \\(1.7\\% ,\\) reversing the op. loss in 1Q25, though gross margin dropped to \\(28.8\\%\\) , the lowest since 1Q22). Management attributed the financial noise in 1H25 to its new '4G' strategy (good users/products/services/mindshare), which focuses on better quality for customers instead of chasing growth/profit. We believe it's a good strategy to differentiate and defend its core users' mindshare, but will likely leave more pressure for its revenue growth and gross margin in 2H25 with large platforms turning more aggressive on subsidies this summer. We forecast Dingdong's revenue to grow \\(2\\%\\) YoY with adj. net profit down \\(15\\%\\) YoY in 3Q25, and mild improvement of \\(4\\%\\) revenue growth and flat adj. net margin of \\(1.5\\%\\) in 2026.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market",
