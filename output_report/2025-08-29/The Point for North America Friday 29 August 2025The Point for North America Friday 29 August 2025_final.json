We view additional spectrum sales by EchoStar as the writing on the wall that the company is shuttering its facilities- based 5G strategy and migrating to a hybrid operator (aka MVNO). For AT&T, we view the deal as a net positive. Beyond enhancing long- term industry structure, the use of spectrum for incremental capacity over densification for a few years should provide \\(\\) 2.5B\\(of run - rate annual savings within five years, representing an annual help to EBITDA of about 100bps. For towers, we think the risk beyond losing EchoStar revenue (or roughly a year of growth) is that underlying organic growth slows by roughly 100bps to 4% instead of a 5% base - case while the incremental spectral capacity gets absorbed by the national carriers.",

But details of revisions do not change the story that underlying demand is slowing outside of a few specific parts of the economy. Upward revisions came largely from intellectual property product and business equipment investment, which have been strong in recent quarters possibly due to strong demand for AI investment. While this trend could continue, we are skeptical that strong investment in this sector will support economic activity more broadly. Consumption was revised modestly higher but services consumption growing just \\(1.2\\%\\) in Q2 has clearly slowed compared to recent years. We expect underlying growth will slow further as the labor market weakens and tariff costs increasingly weigh on activity.",

This should be soft enough to all but ensure a rate cut from the Fed in September. Still, data over the last 3- 4 months have not reflected a sharp weakening in the labor market, with the chance remaining that contracting labor supply limits the increase in the unemployment rate or that hiring picks up after a period of uncertainty. But rising continuing jobless claims and a new high in consumers describing jobs as \"hard to get\" lead us to think the trend of hiring still worsened in August. Continued softening in the labor market into the fall would be a clear signal that a series of rate cuts is likely after September.",

Foreign companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for exact dividend computations. Investors who have received the Product from the Firm may be prohibited in certain states or other jurisdictions from purchasing securities mentioned in the Product from the Firm. Please ask your Financial Consultant for additional details. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. takes responsibility for the Product in the United States. Any orders by US investors resulting from the information contained in the Product may be placed only through Citigroup Global Markets Inc.",
