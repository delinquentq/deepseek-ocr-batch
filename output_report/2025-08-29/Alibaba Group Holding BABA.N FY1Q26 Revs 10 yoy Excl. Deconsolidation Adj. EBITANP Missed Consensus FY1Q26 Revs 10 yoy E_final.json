On the soft side: 1) reported consolidated group revs of Rmb247.6bn, were below our Rmb252.6bn and consensus Rmb253.2bn, which we are not too concerned given the miss likely related to the forecast discrepancy related to the deconsolidated revs of Sun Art and others. 2) Group adj. net profit of 35.3bn, while beat our Rmb32.1bn, came below consensus of Rmb37.6bn. 3) S&M spend +63% yoy to Rmb53.2bn, 21% higher than our forecast.

For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR.

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.
