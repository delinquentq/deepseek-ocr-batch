Italian core HICP inflation stayed unchanged at \\(2.02\\%\\) yoy vs. our expectation of a slight increase to \\(2.1\\%\\) yoy, and energy inflation surprised notably to the downside. Preliminary German regional CPI data released so far suggest that German headline HICP inflation will be around \\(2.0\\%\\) yoy in August, close to our expectations and consensus, supported by stronger energy and food inflation than we expected. Core inflation, in turn, appears to be slightly weaker than we expected, but we leave it at \\(2.4\\%\\) yoy on rounding. Taking the Italian national and German regional data into account, we downgrade our Euro area headline inflation forecast for August to \\(2.0\\%\\) yoy, from \\(2.03\\%\\) yoy previously. We also revise down our Euro area core inflation forecast by 3bp to \\(2.20\\%\\) yoy.",

The downside surprise to our numbers was mostly driven by energy inflation, which declined to \\(-4.4\\%\\) yoy, against our expectations for a slight increase to \\(-3.4\\%\\) yoy. Italian core HICP inflation stayed unchanged at \\(2.02\\%\\) yoy vs. our expectation of a slight increase to \\(2.1\\%\\) yoy, and showed a deceleration in seasonally adjusted sequential terms from \\(0.35\\%\\) mom in July to \\(0.10\\%\\) mom in August.

Preliminary regional CPI data released so far (about \\(87\\%\\) of the total German weight) suggest that German headline HICP inflation will be around \\(2.0\\%\\) yoy in August, close to our expectations and consensus, supported by stronger energy and food inflation than we expected. At the same time, core inflation appears to be slightly weaker than we expected, with core goods inflation somewhat below our expectations, driven, in part, by the clothing component. Package holidays, in turn, printed slightly stronger than we projected. We thus downgrade our estimate for German core HICP slightly but remain at a weak \\(2.4\\%\\) yoy on rounding.",
