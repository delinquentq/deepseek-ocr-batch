While better than forecast cost reductions & strong growth in placement fee reduces the downside risk, visibility beyond a few quarters is low given restrictive & uncertain immigration policy settings. In our view, (1) the HSD tuition fee increases being done by many Aus/ UK universities is making overseas education less attractive for South Asian & Southeast Asian students and would hurt study abroad demand in the long- run, and (3) IEL would find it difficult to deliver share gains over the next 2- 3 years on higher competitive intensity in placements.",
