After opening remarks by the CEO, the CFO and company heads took the stage to give a cross- company overview of the four business areas of focus (mass retail, wealth management & asset management, domestic corporate, and global CIB) under the new medium- term plan running through FY3/28 announced in May. Compared to other banks in our coverage, Mizuho's presentation left the impression of a more integrated group operation and potential for collaborative efforts to create new added value. The presentations by each division conveyed a strong determination to attain FY3/28 targets calling for net business profits of \\(1.4 - 1.6 tn\\) and ROE of over \\(10\\%\\) . We summarize the main takeaways below. The following is our summary of company commentary, unless noted otherwise.",

The new medium- term plan focuses on areas where Mizuho has a competitive advantage, promotes a healthy and safe portfolio through disciplined financial management, and pursues a balance between growth investments and enhanced shareholder returns. The company sees the FY3/28 target for net business profits of \\(1.4 - 1.6 tn\\) as a stepping stone. It believes that by transforming into a truly global financial institution fueled by the significant growth potential in the four business areas, cross- sector growth, and linking of diversified value, it can achieve a significant premium in its share price.",
