IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) reports a historic population decline in 5 major Brazilian capitals: Salvador, Natal, Belem, Porto Alegre, and Belo Horizonte. This trend is part of a broader demographic shift, with \\(37.3\\%\\) of Brazil's 5.6k municipalities experiencing population reductions. The country's total population reached \\(213.4\\mathrm{mn}\\) in 2025, a modest growth of \\(0.39\\%\\) from the previous year. These figures suggest a projected overall population decline starting in 2042, driven by a decreasing birth rate. Investors in sectors like real estate and consumer goods may find these demographic trends significant as they could impact market demand and economic growth.",

The article discusses the future of retail, emphasizing the need for businesses to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) in preparation for the next 5 years of Black Friday events. CEO of consultancy firm Future Today Strategy Amy Webb suggests that humanoid robots will manage inventory and assist customers in physical stores, and highlights the importance of AI in creating personalized shopping experiences. Webb identifies 3 key AI trends for retail: hyper- personalization using biometric data, dynamic content creation, and emotional purchasing. She argues that Brazilian retailers can differentiate themselves by focusing on relationships and communication, rather than just price and product.",
