Created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung for \"The Story of Puca,\" these impish creatures lived in relative obscurity until April 2024, when BLACKPINK's Lisa casually shared her Labubu collection on social media. The ensuing frenzy evokes memories of past collector manias, but amplified by the viral modern social media. Suddenly everyone from Rihanna to David Bedham was flaunting their Labubus. With skyrocketing demand, it was only a matter of time before the fakers entered the chat. Enter the \"Lafufu\"—the counterfeit cousin threatening the integrity of the collection. In this blast, we delve into the subtle art of Labubu authentication, where discerning collectors can arm themselves against an increasingly sophisticated market of imitations.",
