The upward revisions in 2026 and 2027 are a function of the aforementioned better NOI run rate coming out of 2Q compared to our prior model. On the negative side, we still think Street numbers have room to come down some, as drags from the company's developments and timing of lease commencements are notable. But on the positive side, the restructuring of some of its joint ventures (i.e., refinancing debt) should be helpful to reported NAREIT FFO/share; we assume three JVs being recapped in 1Q26 (details below).",

We thus continue to rate shares Neutral.

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website,",
