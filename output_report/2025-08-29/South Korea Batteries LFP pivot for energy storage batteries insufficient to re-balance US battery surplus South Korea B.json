Beyond the gains across the Korea market (KOSPI/KOSDAQ \\(+21\\% / + 10\\%\\) ), we believe there are two additional drivers for the sector rally: (1) LFP- based ESS (energy storage) battery pivot in the US market, and (2) higher lithium prices on the back of Chinese supply disruption (which may lead to one- time inventory gains). Fundamentally, we see three reasons to remain cautious:",

US energy storage battery demand was 47 GWh in 2024, and we expect it to reach 62 GWh in 2027E. In 2024, c.85% of this demand was met through imports from China. Starting in 2026, tariffs on Chinese ESS batteries are set to rise, and as such, Korean battery makers are pivoting to LFP batteries (which appear more cost competitive after accounting for manufacturing tax credits) by converting some of their existing nickel battery lines originally built for EVs. However, we note the TAM for ESS is smaller compared to our expectation of a US EV battery surplus of c.115 GWh in 2027E (based on our yield-adjusted supply estimates). The displaced US ESS TAM upside is also much smaller than investor expectations for the US EV TAM opportunity previously supporting the sector strength in 2022-23. That said, we note LGES could enjoy better early mover margins for ESS batteries as Korea battery peers SDI/SKI are yet to announce confirmed orders and firm timeline for LFP capacity conversions.",

Our US Auto team expects that beyond the removal of the IRA Clean Vehicle Credits on 30th Sep-2025, reduced US emissions rules (i.e., overturning of the ACC II and CAFE standards exemption) could also be an incremental headwind to US EV demand. In Europe, we note Chinese OEMs have been expanding market share within the growing Europe EV TAM. China battery exports (especially LFP) have also been rising (Exhibit 9), while key European OEMs (i.e., Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault) are pivoting towards LFP batteries for some of their models. In the absence of any cell import barriers, LFP imports from China are still more cost-effective than domestically produced batteries in Europe (Exhibit 10). Thus, we believe Korean cell makers risk ceding market share with more limited growth",

With the US reciprocal tariffs in place, we continue to see risk of delay in US BEV TCO (total cost of ownership) parity with ICE cars compared to our prior baseline of 2026E (Exhibit 7). Our Global auto team also expects a growing structural shift in the US towards HEV from ICE vehicles amid rising consumer preference for a balance between fuel efficiency and power performance.

We remain positive on LGES' fundamentals given its widening global technology leadership in batteries with upcoming commercial production of new technology battery products such as large size cylindrical 4680 batteries, cell- to- pack LFP batteries (from 2025) and dry electrode process (from 2028). Meanwhile, we see market share growth in the US, driven by rapidly expanding capacities where we expect its US market share growth to be margins and returns accretive (GSe 2025E- 27E EBITDA CAGR of 52% and 5.9% CROCI expansion during this period). However, the stock is now pricing in line with our base case market share and core EBITDA margin growth in 2030E at 15.0%/19.1% vs. 11.5%/9.1% in 2024. We see balanced risk reward given the variance to current share price in our bear/base/bull case scenarios. We note LGES also has the highest 45X IRA",
