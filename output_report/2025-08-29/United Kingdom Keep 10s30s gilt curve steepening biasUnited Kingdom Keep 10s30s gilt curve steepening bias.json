The PMI continues to indicate a weak jobs market, but the stronger than expected flash PMI for August suggests upside risks to our 3Q GDP forecast of \\(0.8\\%\\) q/q annualised.

We think a combination of a large downshift in wage growth and further declines in employment growth, alongside clear signs of weaker- than- expected headline and food inflation in September, are needed for the BoE to ease in November. Tighter fiscal policy at the Autumn budget would likely pose downside growth risks into 2026, but given the OBR needs 10 weeks to prepare forecasts and with no budget date announced yet, it is more likely that an Autumn budget will be delivered after the November \\(6^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) MPC meeting. MPC OIS prices around 5bp of easing for November, a cumulative 10bp by the end of this year and just about 25bp of easing by next March (Figure 2). We keep received Nov25 MPC OIS given the limited easing priced as we wait to see labour market and inflation data over the coming months, but we do see a heightened chance that the BoE skips easing in November.",
