      "text": "- LEGRAND ONTO ANALYST FOCUS LIST, ABB, SCHNEIDER TO NEUTRAL: Phil Buller follows up yesterday's Siemens note (HERE) with a note that moves the rest of the large cap Electricals onto active recommendations. Legrand is most preferred and goes onto the Analyst Focus List while ABB and Schneider are both rated Neutral. Core message is that the Data Center market remains a strong and sustained growth driver. That said, it is reflected well in consensus forecasts. We see upside to Legrand consensus from a nascent recovery in European residential construction with the option of a US office recovery to come. We are not significantly different to consensus for either ABB or Schneider with our forecasts - hence the Neutral rating. We note that ABB is going to spin its Robotics business and is hosting a Capital Markets Day on Nov \\(18^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) . There is no Capital markets Day in the Schneider calendar and we believe that the Company would benefit from such an event to reassure investors that there is potential for margin gearing in the business. NOTE IS HERE",

Germany and Spain were relative bright spots while the UK, Italy and France saw car sales decline. Germany is encouraging because it offers another data point implying an economic recovery (remember Holcim management comments from the dinner re Germans are getting more confident). Brand wise, BYD and SAIC saw very strong sales growth (from a low base) - but it looks like Tesla is the main share donor. BMW continues to outperform Mercedes, VW and Renault are performing best in the mass segments. It would be nice to get comfort on LCV sales for Renault to give confidence it can recover from the recent profit warning.",

While the energy transition remains an overarching theme, history has shown that renewable energy build- out at scale does not necessarily translate into returns at all points of the value chain. Industry cycles, technological advancement, and geopolitics all come into play. In this report, we give10 answers to questions relating to the transition on three main Topics: 1) Which transition value chains are in supply tightness or emerging as important ones? 2) Where are geopolitical risks less well understood? 3) Which transition technologies will be the next game changers?
