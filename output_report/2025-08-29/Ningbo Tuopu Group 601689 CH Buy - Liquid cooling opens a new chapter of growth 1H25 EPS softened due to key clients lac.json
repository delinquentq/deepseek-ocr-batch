Further, 3) we believe the company's foray into liquid cooling solutions, including self- developed products such as pumps, temperature- pressure sensors, control valves, gas- liquid separators, and diverters, positions it well for diversification, with CNY1.7bn in secured orders and ongoing engagements with tier- 1 suppliers and key clients such as Huawei (Unlisted), Nvidia (NVDA US, Not rated), and Meta (META US, Not rated); this segment is likely to emerge as a meaningful new growth driver over the medium to long term. In addition, 4) Tuopu's humanoid robot initiatives are likely to track toward mass production in 2026F, while its entrenched market share with core client underscores sustained competitive advantages and potential for multi- year revenue/earnings upside.",
