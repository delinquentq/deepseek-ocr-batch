We believe the impact on industry from retroactive tariffs should be contained and FSLR is a clear beneficiary. Separately, majority of investors we spoke with agreed with our GNRC downgrade, but bulls see more catalysts and upside into 3Q. Finally, a lot of news on nuclear. Fusion deserves more attention given the amount of capital raise, number of new customer contracts, and technological progress.",

Notably, Cameco (not covered) lowered (8/28) its 2025 production outlook by \\~19% to \\~14.5 million lbs of U308 for its McArthur River mine operation due to development delays. Separately, Centrus signed (8/25) an MOU with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and POSCO International to explore potential investment to support capacity expansion, along with an expanded LEU supply agreement. Lastly, the DOE announced (8/26) a second round of HALEU allocations with conditional commitments made to Antares Nuclear, Standard Nuclear, and Abilene Christian University/Natura Resources, based on the program's prioritization criteria. Some deliveries could occur this year. Initial allocations were made to five companies including TerraPower and Kairos Power in April. DOE still plans to make additional awards after this round. Agreements: X- energy, AMZN (covered by Ronald JoSe), KHNP, and Doosan announced (8/25) a partnership to accelerate the deployment of Xe- 100 SMRs and TRISO- X fuel. The agreement includes collaboration on design, supply chain, and construction. We note that X- energy has an existing relationship with Korean partners including DL E&C. Separately, Uthasigned (8/25) an MOU with TerraPower and land development firm Flagship Companies to evaluate a Natrium reactor and storage facility in the state. Preliminary site recommendations are expected by YE25.

The USITC is focused on whether the imports materially injure domestic industry.

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"-\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds \\(15\\%\\) against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation.

The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company (ies) referred to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company (ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication.

Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product.

For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons.
