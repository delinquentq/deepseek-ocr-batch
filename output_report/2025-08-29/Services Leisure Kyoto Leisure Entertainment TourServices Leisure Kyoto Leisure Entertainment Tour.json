IP collaborations have boosted customer spend/footfall and streamlined sales promotion costs. With staff numbers optimized to store size, the company expects the sales boost from higher incomes for young adults (e.g., increased hourly rates for part- time jobs, higher starting salaries for new employees) to outweigh higher labor costs caused by wage hikes.",
