In that context, a narrowing RBA- Fed differential, changing correlations between USD and equities, and a more structural view of USD downside (not one we share) could incentive AU investors to adjust FX hedge ratios. The latest ABS foreign currency exposure survey suggests such ratios had been relatively low historically, though the data is quite lagged (Figure 6). It is also difficult to forecast when these hedge ratio adjustments will take place - if they take place at all - but we continue to watch for signs in our real money AUD flows for renewed buying.",

For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",
