Further, we note that CDR made some progress on supporting its existing franchises by announcing a strategic partnership with Scopely (as per its Flywheel concept). With regard to game production, the most significant expenditure on development projects incurred during the reporting period related to The Witcher 4, Cyberpunk 2 and Sirius projects which were in the development phase. The largest expenditure incurred was on research related to the Hadar project. As part of its investment activities, the Parent Company also executed construction work on the CD Projekt campus in Warsaw, including, in particular, the work associated with the final stage of the construction and fitting out the new office building customized to the specific characteristics of the work on game development. As of June, \\(70\\%\\) of sales came from physical copies sold.

In the first half of 2025, CD Projekt announced that The Witcher 3 reached an important sales milestone, celebrating its 10th anniversary in May and selling over 60 million copies over that timeframe. In the framework of its strategy adopted in 2022, in the coming years the CDR studio intends to focus on a new Witcher trilogy, the first installment of which is The Witcher 4 (formerly code- named Polaris). Other games in CD Projekt's pipeline from the Witcher universe include 1) Project Sirius - a game with multiplayer features set in The Witcher universe; and 2) The Witcher Remake - a retelling of the first part of The Witcher, developed with the use of modern technologies, in collaboration with Fool's Theory.
