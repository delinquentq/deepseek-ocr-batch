With the expanded supply and strong market demand, mgmt raised the FY25 guidance for Nefecon to Rmb1.2- 1.4bn (vs. Rmb1bn previously) and for the first time provided FY26 guidance of Rmb2.4- 2.6bn; 2) Xerava (Rmb143mn, \\(+7\\%\\) y/y, \\(- 35\\%\\) h/h, vs. GSe Rmb232mn) with negative impact from channel destocking while the in- hospital sales remained strong (+37% y/y), and the company has initiated the process for domestic manufacturing in preparation for the potential NRDL coverage in 2027 for Xerava. Net loss of Rmb- 250mn narrowed at a faster pace (- 61% y/y, or - 31% y/y for adjusted non- IFRS NI, vs. GSe Rmb- 323mn) with: 1) lower R&D spending (Rmb195mn, - 23% y/y), as the R&D focus shifted to early- stage assets (e.g. EVER- 001, mRNA cancer vaccines, in- vivo CAR- T); 2) managed growth in SG&A investment (Rmb426mn, \\(+48\\%\\) h/h, vs. GSe Rmb470mn) with the Nefecon coverage approaching mature stage (29 provinces covered, target to cover 1,000 hospitals in 2H, representing 80% addressable market, per mgmt), while we expect continued investment to prepare for Etrasimod approval in early- 26. With losses narrowing faster in 1H, management now expects operational profitability in 2H25 instead of 4Q25 (previously).",
