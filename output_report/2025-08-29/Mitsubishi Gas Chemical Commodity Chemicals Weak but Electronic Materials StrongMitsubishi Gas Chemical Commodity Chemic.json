BT materials (copper clad laminates) and OPE (CCL raw material) did well. Our estimates put MGC's shares in BT materials in 2024 at \\(\\sim 55\\%\\) for the FC- CSP field and 5% for FC- BGA. More recently its share in FC- BGA looks to have topped 10% with increasing new uptake. Resonanc remains strong in this field, and we surmise that other players have lost share. MGC is strong in materials with low thermal expansion rates, and we also expect shipments for Al servers starting from 2026. OPE is used in printed circuit boards compatible with high frequencies, and applications are broadening from existing use in Al servers to ordinary servers, switches, and base stations.",

For BT materials, despite concerns about a shortage of raw- material glass cloth, we believe MGC has sufficient stocks of both raw materials and products. We also expect sales of special functional materials to beat plan in F3/26, and F3/27 to bring the wherewithal to absorb rising BT material quality- related costs (inspection costs) as production processes become more familiar. We have lowered our F3/26e OP from ¥52bn to ¥50bn (- 2% YoY) but still expect a beat vs. ¥46bn guidance, while our forecast for F3/27 is ¥64bn (+28% YoY).",
