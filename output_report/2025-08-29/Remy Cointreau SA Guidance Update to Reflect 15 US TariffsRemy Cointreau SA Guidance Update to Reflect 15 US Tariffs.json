      "text": "Updated FY26 guidance: Remy has issued a press release this morning updating its FY26 assumptions to reflect the \\(15\\%\\) US tariff rate (vs the \\(30\\%\\) rate initially reflected in the company's guidance), with the company now expecting a net €20m impact to EBIT from US tariffs (vs €35m previously under the assumption of a \\(30\\%\\) tariffs). We note that our numbers already reflect the \\(15\\%\\) tariff rate (we had assumed a \\(\\sim \\in 17.5m\\) impact, broadly in- line with the €20m indicated). Remy has subsequently updated its overall guidance for FY26 org EBIT to decline - MSD% compared to - M- HSD% previously (MSE - \\(3.7\\%\\) ; VA cons - \\(4.1\\%\\) ). Considering that the \\(\\sim \\in 15m\\) absolute difference in the estimated impact from tariffs corresponds to \\(\\sim 7\\%\\) of the FY25 EBIT base, we note that this updated guidance therefore appears to imply an increased level of reinvestment, though the press release suggests that the €20m net impact is already factoring in increased investments to support the recovery in underlying business activity (while other spirits peers appear to be tightening spend). We remain relative Underweight on Remy Cointreau - we are cautious on underlying fundamental trends and see a risk of a subdued earnings trajectory for longer as the company reinvests following protective savings measures in recent years (see more here, here).",
