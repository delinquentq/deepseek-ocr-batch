This holds not only at the front- end of the inflation curve, but is also true for longer- dated forwards (Exhibit 1). One potential explanation for the strong correlation between medium- term traded inflation and oil prices could be the salience of petrol prices in consumers' minds and thus in setting inflation expectations. Those, in turn, are an important input factor for medium- term inflation in most economic models. We find that petrol prices have a much stronger explanatory power for setting consumers' inflation expectations than other inflation components (Exhibit 2). On the other hand, energy price spikes feed into inflation quickly, albeit typically not for long, as supply rebalancing or the monetary response bring prices down again.",

We find that a \\(10\\%\\) positive oil price shock leads to a significant increase in traded inflation across the curve in USD, EUR and GBP traded inflation markets. As expected, oil price shocks more strongly affect shorter tenors, which rise by 15- 25bp after two weeks across markets (Exhibit 3). The belly and long end of the inflation curve rise more modestly, with 10y breakeven up by about 5- 10bp after two weeks. In line with the literature, we find a stronger response in EUR and GBP than in USD, which is consistent with the former two economies' greater exposure to commodity prices in their inflation baskets. This potentially also reflects the greater vulnerabilities to commodities shocks (or at least the perception of such) of smaller, open economies that rely exclusively on imports.",

      "text": "To distinguish between supply and demand shocks, we develop a model based on prior Fed research, that decomposes changes in oil prices into these two factors. We can then use these decomposed demand and supply oil price shocks to sharpen our estimates of inflation sensitivity. Consistent with theory and the literature, across the different markets we find that demand shocks boost traded inflation more strongly than supply shocks. Demand shocks have the strongest effect on the front end and belly of the inflation curve, with 2y breakeven up 10- 20bp after two weeks across markets (Exhibit 5). Further out the curve, the effect roughly halves, as markets presumably maintain confidence that central banks will eventually prevent the economy from overheating and thereby contain the inflationary effect in the medium term. The corollary of this is that markets should also reprice real rates higher in expectation of this reaction. However, while there is no systematic effect on longer- dated rates, we find that short- term real rates decline initially, as nominal rates do not rise sufficiently or quickly enough to buffer the inflationary impulse (Exhibit 7).",

For the real economy, supply shocks, or \"cost- push shocks,\" simultaneously increase inflation and hamper growth, as production factors become scarcer. That complicates the monetary response, as the different mandates of maximising employment and ensuring price stability come into direct conflict. Consistent with this, we find a more negative effect on front- end real rates in the US (as the Fed has been explicitly given a dual mandate and thus needs to weigh the monetary response more carefully) than in the Euro area (where the ECB pursues a single mandate of price stability). Longer- dated real rates in the Euro area do see a modest increase (Exhibit 8). Further, we find no significant increase in longer- dated breakevens, as markets price in the expectation of a slowdown in growth and inflation undershoot in the future, in line with the theoretical prediction.",

While non- OPEC and OPEC supply increases continue to bias oil prices lower in the near term (our oil strategists expect Brent to average \\(64 / bbl\\) in 2025Q4 and \\(56 in 2026\\) ), geopolitical risk in the Middle East persists, which could cause a future oil price spike. On the other hand, a potential Ukraine peace deal could lead to increased oil and gas flows from Russia - or at least shift the distribution of risks. For now, our strategists do not expect a significant impact, given that a restoration of pipeline flows remains unlikely in the near term, but eventual increased supply, and lower energy prices in general, could act as a further drag on European traded inflation in particular.",

As an example, certain clients may request to receive notifications when research on specific securities is published, and certain clients may request that specific data underlying analysts' fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst's fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.",
