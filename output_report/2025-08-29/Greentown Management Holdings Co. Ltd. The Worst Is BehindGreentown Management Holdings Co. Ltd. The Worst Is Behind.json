Overall new order quality was optimized with stabilizing take rate of 2- 3%. Management observed a more rational market this year, marked by fewer price wars and new entrants. As lower- quality players exit, remaining participants are increasingly focused on profitability. With this backdrop, management is confident in securing Rmb10bn in new orders for 2025 (+10% y-y) and sustaining that level in subsequent years (Exhibit 1).",

We estimate \\(42.9\\%\\) gross margin for 2027 with relatively stable segment margins and better revenue mix with less contribution from government projects. Net profit: After reflecting slower revenue booking and lower gross margin, hampered by lower take rate amid rising competition since late 2021, we project net profit to reach Rmb484mn, Rmb495mn, and Rmb523mn, respectively, for 2025, 2026, and 2027, indicating a \\(40\\%\\) decline for 2025 and bottoming earnings with growth rates of \\(2\\%\\) and \\(6\\%\\) for 2026 and 2027, respectively.
