Aggregate L4W carload growth across all segments has picked up from the prior week's levels, and all are now in positive growth territory (whereas last week Merchandise was down a few bps YoY). Western rails are experiencing a bit of a drag particularly from Intermodal, though this comes on hard comps from last year's diversions away from East Coast ports ahead of strike risk. Service across rails is looking good on a YoY- basis, though NSC's trains appear to still be running a bit slower YoY. An overall improving volume and service backdrop is welcome news, but market attention remains focused more on the long- term implications of mergers rather than near- term margin trends.

Total North American carloads have seen a meaningful acceleration in growth from the prior week's (i.e. Week 33) L4W levels, going from just +50bps YoY to +140bps YoY this past week. This was driven by sizable jumps in L4W YoY carload growth at the Canadian rails, which actually saw the highest YoY growth levels of the whole group by a significant amount (next largest is NSC, at just +1% YoY). We'd point out, though, that this time last year was around the Canadian rail labor dispute that led to a gradual shutdown of shipments to avoid stranded cargo / an eventual full shutdown on Aug. 22 that lasted a few days (Week 34 comps incorporate these dates, including the start of the shutdown). As such, CN / CPKC have easier comps right now, helping to bolster their numbers. Meanwhile, Western rails UNP / BNSF actually saw slight slowdowns from Week 33 levels and are now the only two rails in L4W negative YoY growth territory. Western rail YoY slowdowns from last week were driven by weaker Coal and Intermodal numbers; in contrast to the Canadian players, which saw solid improvement across all segments, particularly Intermodal, vs. last week. Eastern rails have improved slightly vs. last week's L4W YoY growth levels for total carloads, but improvement for both is less than 1%, and the drivers of the pickup vary between the two rails. For NSC, Intermodal and Merchandise are looking better than they were in Week 33, whereas for CSX, improvement is coming mostly from Coal and a bit from Merchandise. Now when it comes to the Western and Eastern rails, we'd point out that they too experienced labor dispute drama around this time last year, with threats of an East Coast port strike that was potentially going to unfold on Oct. 1, leading some shippers to divert volume to the West during weeks leading up to that point. As such, Western rails face tougher Intermodal comps during this period / weeks to come, which helps explain the weaker YoY performance vs. peers right now.",
