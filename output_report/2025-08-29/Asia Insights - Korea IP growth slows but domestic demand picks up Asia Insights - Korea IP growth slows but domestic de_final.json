However, year-on-year growth in IP picked up sharply \\(5.0\\%\\) in July from \\(1.6\\%\\) in June, suggesting underlying growth trends have held up relatively well. Reflecting weaker activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, all industry production growth also slowed.- Domestic demand picked up, with retail sales and business facility investment growth increasing and offsetting weaker construction activity. Key activity directly related to service consumption also picked up, though headline growth in service production slowed due to weaker activity in the finance sector.- Nomura-KRnow is tracking Q3 GDP growth at \\(1.1\\%\\) q-o-q, sa (our base case forecast: \\(1.1\\%\\) ), up from \\(0.6\\%\\) in Q2, indicating a strong recovery ahead. We maintain our 2025 GDP growth forecast of \\(1.0\\%\\) (BOK: \\(0.9\\%\\) ).- We expect the BOK to focus more on forward-looking downside risk due to higher tariffs despite the near-term strong pick up in headline growth. So, we maintain our forecast for two more 25bp cuts in October and February (terminal rate: \\(2.00\\%\\) ). However, because of the BOK's cautious economic outlook, we believe the risk is skewed towards faster cuts rather than slower cuts. We now assign a \\(15\\%\\) probability to consecutive cuts in Q4, reflecting the BOK's preference for pre-emptive action against downside risks.",
