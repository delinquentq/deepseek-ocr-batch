If we think of the commercial strategy and the monetization strategy, there is one part of the business which is linear and which is underpinned by customer demand for linear advertising. And this is mature market, shrinking in the first half and slightly shrinking in the second half should I stay. And in that line of business, in that segment, it's a market share game and we're focused on increasing our market share. In the digital space, our objective is to take a foothold in that segment, which is growing very fast and from which we have historically been absent and which is occupied by the likes of YouTube. We want to take a significant market share in that market by presenting ourselves to the customers as an alternative to the current players occupying that segment and this is done by creating digital business, which delivers significant digital inventories. And that's what we do quite well with TF1+ and this is totally distinct commercial strategies in the two segments of our business.\" Are advertisers really buying linear and digital separately? Same question for agencies? Or do they have a video budget?

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
