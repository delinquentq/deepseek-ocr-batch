As a rule, JGBs for individual investors may not be sold in the first 12 months after issuance.

When inflation- indexed JGBs are purchased via public offerings, secondary distributions (uridashi deals), or other OTC transactions with Nomura Securities, only the purchase price shall be paid, with no sales commission charged. Inflation- indexed JGBs carry the risk of losses, as prices fluctuate in line with changes in market interest rates and fluctuations in the nationwide consumer price index. The notional principal of inflation- indexed JGBs changes in line with the rate of change in nationwide CPI inflation from the time of its issuance. The amount of the coupon payment is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate by the notional principal at the time of payment. The maturity value is the amount of the notional principal when the issue becomes due. For J117 and subsequent issues, the maturity value shall not undercut the face amount.
