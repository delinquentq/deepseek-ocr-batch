FY26 le sera également, avec un T1 très faible, une poursuite du contrôle des coûts (bien que contrebalancé par l'impact des droits de douane) et une amélioration de la conversion en cash mais une dilution liée aux cessions. La question cruciale est cependant de savoir ce qui est susceptible de sous-tendre la progression attendue par le groupe de son CA entre +3% et +6%. Les tendances sous-jacentes en Inde restent solides et s'amélioreront avec la cession d'Imperial Blue. L'effet négatif lié à l'activité Vins disparaîtra. Les tendances de parts de marché aux Etats-Unis évoluent dans la bonne direction (bien que pas encore vraiment positives) et sont en territoire positif sur de nombreux marchés. Toutefois, le redressement de la croissance du marché sous-jacent aux Etats-Unis et en Chine est fondamental. Sur les deux marchés, nous estimons que la tendance finira par s'inverser même si aucun signe n'est encore visible. Il faudra probablement attendre la saison des fêtes aux Etats-Unis et l'approche du Nouvel An chinois avant que les indications ne deviennent plus claires.",

En outre, la récente augmentation des droits d'accise dans l'Etat indien du Maharashtra, qui prend effet au T1, conduit à une augmentation du prix de vente au détail pour compenser les taxes plus élevées (avec probablement un effet d'anticipation au T4).
