      "text": "Haitian reported 1H25 results on Aug 28th sales/NP of Rmb15.2bn/Rmb3.9bn growing \\(7.6\\% /13.3\\%\\) respectively, largely in line with GSe. Implied 2Q25 sales/net profit grew \\(7.0\\% /11.6\\%\\) yoy to Rmb6.9bn/Rmb1.7bn respectively, with sales in line and NP slightly above GSe and NPM at \\(24.8\\%\\) (up 1ppt yoy) mainly on better- than- expected GPM expansion (up 3.9ppt yoy). Condiments sales were up \\(10.5\\%\\) in 1H25/10.6% in 2Q25. Haitian delivered solid performance despite catering retail softness amid negative policy impacts with strong momentum across all categories, echoing our view on its sales resilience supported by category/channel/regional expansion, and sufficient profitability improvement headroom enabled by category scale- up and unmatched economies of scale (see our recent H share initiation). Key surprises of the results: 1) Key products soy sauce sales showed strong momentum, up by \\(10.3\\%\\) in 2Q25, with overall condiments growing by \\(9.6\\% /9.8\\% /12.7\\%\\) for other sauce/oyster sauce/other condiments. 2) Online channel achieved \\(35\\%\\) yoy sales growth in 2Q25 at Rmb425mn and kept healthy offline channel growth at \\(9\\%\\) yoy to Rmb6,155mn. The key to watch now is the sustainability of such performance going forward with policy impact starting from late May (catering retail sales slowdown to \\(0.9\\% /1.1\\%\\) in June/July). 3) GPM expanded by 3.9ppt yoy mainly driven by GPM expansion in soy sauce and flavored sauce, likely on cost tailwinds (see our July cost tracker) and efficiency enhancement gains. Condiment GPM was up by 2.8ppt yoy in 2Q25 while overall GPM expansion (+3.9ppt) was further boosted by reduced non- condiments sales. Of note, soy sauce/oyster sauce/flavored sauce GPM reached \\(48.1\\% /35.9\\% /44.1\\%\\) in 1H25, expanding by 3.9ppt/2.8ppt/6.7ppt yoy. Interim dividend announced for the first time with Rmb1.5bn cash payout (payout ratio at c.39%). ESOP annual KPI announced for 2025: The company also announced 2025 KPI for its ESOP (plan covering 2024- 28) with 2025 net profit target at no less than \\(10.8\\%\\) yoy. We reiterate our Buy rating on the H- share which is trading at 23x 2026 P/E at a c.22% discount to Haitian A- share (Neutral).",
