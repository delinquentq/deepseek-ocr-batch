In the autonomous trucking space, the Department of Transportation issued a Request for Information to advance a nationwide AV program, signaling a major step toward broader AV adoption. Also, driving adoption is Aurora and McLeod's newly announced partnership to create the industry's first Transportation Management System for autonomous trucks. The collaboration offers customers a way to track and oversee self- driving freight with beta testing underway and full launch planned for 2026 for McLeod customers. As bellwether moves gain momentum and regulatory backing strengthens, other AV companies are doubling down on safety initiatives. Kodiak announced the integration of NXP's automotive processors and in- vehicle networking interfaces to enhance redundant braking, steering, throttle, and overall safety for its AV trucks. Waabi launched its new mixed reality testing system simulating complex driving scenarios for safer AV development while Torc announced a collaboration with Edge Case, focusing on an independent assessment of its Driverless Safety Case Framework. Finally, PlusAI continued the safety platoon with a partnership with Goodyear Tire focusing on tire efficiency and safety with Goodyear's intelligent tire technology suite. On the electric truck front, Greenlane, a joint venture between BlackRock, Daimler Truck and NextEra Energy, announced plans to build its second commercial electric vehicle charging corridor connecting Southern California to Phoenix via the I- 10th addition to this infrastructure milestone, MAN introduced its mobile Smart Charging solutions for remote heavy- duty operations and tested its EV trucks at eight along Europe's Brenner Pass, while Fonterra launched its first electric refrigerated truck in partnership with Volvo. Also internationally, Maxus debuted its new eDELIVER 75 - a fully electric 7.5- tonne GVW truck and Hino Motors in Japan started testing unmanned AVs in full- scale road surface durability trials.",

On the drone front there were numerous advancements. The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a rule to simplify certification for air carriers, signaling stronger regulatory support for nationwide drone deployment. As regulatory support grows, drone delivery companies continue to make inroads and partnerships. AMZN Prime is set to launch drone delivery in the Kansas City metro area before the holidays, with recently rolled out operations now active in Waco, Texas. In food drone delivery, GoTo Foods, Wing, and DoorDash are testing drone delivery across Texas, while Chipotle has partnered with Zipline to offer zero- emission drone delivery in greater Dallas. In warehouse and logistics improvements, CHRW has launched its Always- on Logistics Planner, a service powered by AI agents that automates routine tasks, unearths insights, and enhances global coordination across shipment modes.

Yet the long- promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas. That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages. While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone- based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
