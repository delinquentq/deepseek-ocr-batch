The 2Q25 revenue growth beat our estimates by \\(24\\%\\) , likely driven by stronger momentum in data center transceivers, in our view. Earnings grew \\(78.4\\%\\) y- y in 1H25 (2Q25: \\(69.3\\%\\) y- y), in line with our estimates. GPM declined 2.2pp y- y in 2Q25, mainly driven by product mix change (more contributions from optical transceivers), but partially offset by its effective expense control (opex down by 0.3pp y- y in 1H25). We raise FY25- 27F revenue forecasts by \\(5 - 21\\%\\) and earnings forecasts by \\(4 - 19\\%\\) to reflect better DC transceiver demand. We maintain our Buy rating and raise TP to CNY80, based on 43x FY26F EPS of CNY1.87 (previously 36x), in line with a FY24- 27F earnings CAGR of \\(43\\%\\) . The stock is trading at 36.7x FY26F EPS.",

      "text": "China CSPs capex might still rise despite uncertainty over advanced AI chip export control As one of the key suppliers of high- end optical transceivers for China Cloud service providers (CSPs), we think Accelink is well positioned to benefit from likely capex increase for CSPs in 2H25F and 2026F. Despite the recent turmoil about NVIDIA's (NVDA US, Not rated) H20 chip exports, we think there are still solid demand for advanced AI chips from the US and China's leading AI chipmakers. Moreover, we think Huawei's (unlisted) Cloud Matrix 384 super node (see our AI thematic report: Huawei Cloud Matrix 384) which is equipped with Huawei's Ascend AI chips might gain traction in China's CSP market, and Accelink will be a key beneficiary as a long- time partner of Huawei. We estimate Accelink will deliver a \\(53\\%\\) revenue CAGR in FY24- 27F for optical transceivers, which should contribute \\(49\\%\\) of revenue in FY27F.",

The company is able to use in- house designed optical chips for its transceiver products in the mid- to- low end segment (400G and below); while it is striving to tap into high- end chip segment. Geopolitical risk and China's resolution on tech / AI ecosystem autonomy underscore the importance of domestic optical chips; and we believe the company could enjoy sustainable demand from 1.6T / 3.2T transceivers and CPO switches.",
