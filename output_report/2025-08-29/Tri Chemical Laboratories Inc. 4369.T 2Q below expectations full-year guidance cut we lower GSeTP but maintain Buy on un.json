      "text": "Tri Chemical Laboratories' 2Q1/26 operating profits came in at just under ¥1.5 bn (up 15% yoy, down 14% qoq), below our ¥1.8 bn estimate. Recurring profits, however, were just under ¥2.2 bn (up 34% yoy, up 32% qoq), slightly above our ¥2.1 bn estimate, thanks in part to solid equity- method income. The company lowered full- year operating profit guidance from ¥6.05 bn to ¥5.5 bn, mainly due to lower High- k material consumption per wafer at Chinese customers as a result of improved production efficiency, along with the impact of inventory reductions. This was unexpected, and we lower our FY1/26- FY1/28 operating profit estimates by 19%/15%/10%, mainly to reflect lower sales in mainland China. We also lower our target price from ¥5,600 to ¥4,810, and we think the stock may react negatively to the results in the near term. Mainland China sales, which have been a source of market concern due to export restrictions and other factors, fell from 44% of total sales in 1Q to 30% in 2Q (we assume a further decline to 23% in FY1/27). However, 3D NAND cryogenic etching materials, which we see as a longer- term growth driver, are steadily expanding in line with the company's initial expectations. Sales of various materials for leading- edge logic/foundry applications and High- k materials for DRAM applications outside of China are also generally strong, and we believe the growth story for FY1/27 and beyond is intact. We maintain our Buy rating.",

The company expects sales to decline qoq in 3Q and recover somewhat in 4Q, but remain below the 2Q level. It said that the decline was due mainly to lower consumption per unit of production and inventory adjustments, and not to market share losses or price declines due to new market entrants. The company's 2H sales plan for mainland China is low compared with the assumed sales level of its Korean equity- method affiliate, which also handles High- k materials.

The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for specific metrics for each stock. The normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may vary depending on the fiscal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows:",

We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%- 50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%- 30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%- 15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.",
