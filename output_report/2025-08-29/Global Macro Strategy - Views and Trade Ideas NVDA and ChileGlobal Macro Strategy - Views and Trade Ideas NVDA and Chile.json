Ahead of time we had trimmed risk by taking profits on our Taiwan equity long (see Global Macro Strategy: Fed trumps French politics - add to US 5s30s steepeners, USD shorts). The reason was not so much fear of a NVDA miss, but a sense that the risk reward into the number was not clear cut at a time when September has famously poor seasonals for equities, and as we expect the continued TGA build to impact liquidity negatively. In the event, NVDA has not been a negative catalyst. While the stock is slightly weaker, our equity analyst thinks that the quarter was largely in line, as was guidance. The guidance does not include China business, as NVDA has not shipped to China in the just reported quarter. Maybe more importantly for macro investors, NVDA expects a 3 to 4 trn USD AI infrastructure spend by the end of 2030, suggesting that a multi- year AI capex boom is not slowing down any time soon.",

We have been big AI and tech bulls for some time and have been trading US equities and US tech from the long side again since early April. However, we also have pointed out that September can be seasonally tricky and that liquidity is likely to tighten in September with the TGA rebuild, another negative factor. Given these two factors we continue to wait for a pull- back to add additional risk to our existing equity longs. As suggested last week, China is a candidate to add risk, but China also suffers from very poor September seasonals. We therefore bid our time.",

The candidates, ordered by polling market expectations (Figure 1), are right candidate Jose Antonio Kast, left candidate Jeannette Jara, center- right candidate Evelyn Matthei, and populist candidate Franco Parisi. Kast's popularity has surged with a focus on law and order. He has labeled his economic plan \"The Takeoff\" (El Despegue), emphasizing deregulation, VAT tax cuts, and trimming public spending. His pro- business stance, including additional support for free trade and investment, will likely be welcomed by markets. Jara has proposed more state- led growth (social programs), higher taxes, and public ownership of lithium, which would be seen as a negative by markets. Matthei is campaigning on aggressive spending cuts and a gradual reduction in corporate taxes. Seen as fiscally responsible, moderate, Matthei presidency could excite markets.

Typical election playbook is for the FX selloff into the first round and rally after the second round, which we saw in the last three Chilean elections (Figure 2). But this usually requires a tight election with two quite polarizing candidates who moderate once in office. Recent polling (Cadem, 8/24) suggests that Kast is the current favorite in presidential expectation with some margin, although in first round voting, Kast and Jara are effectively tied. Second- round match ups (Figure 4) show Kast winning against Jara and Matthei and Matthei beating Jara – both of which are not overly compelling for the election trade, in our view. However, with more than 2 months to go, there is still much that can change. Momentum may shift from Kast to another candidate. Jara could soften her left image and commit to more fiscal discipline, which could narrow margins. If Jara were to narrow the gap, markets would likely react by selling Chile assets.",

While a stronger USD is not our base case, we believe this would also help the election trade to come into its own.",

In the 2008 and 2011 USD buying intervention (Figure 5), CLP sold off immediately after the announcement, which we have not seen yet in the current episode. In 2008, USDCLP continued upward, while in 2011, USDCLP then slowly moved downward. So far, CLP has been rangebound, partially driven by sideways moves in the dollar. On the other side of the ledger, USDCLP has generally moved lower when the central bank started to sell USD, resulting overall in a decent track record for FX intervention overall.",

So far, neither the rates nor the CTOT signal has triggered, but a weaker copper market in line with Citi commodity strategy would certainly be helpful. Positioning is relatively neutral.

Governor Ueda's speech at Jackson Hole touched upon the theme of a demographic decline in Japan (Figure 7) and its impact on the labour market, a theme we had previously covered in Consumer prices move first, growth fundamentals come second (05- Jun- 25). Pre- Covid inflation remained subdued despite some labour market tightness (Figure 8). Part of that story is that the spillover in full- time wages has been limited in the past, because of the steep increase in part- time workers among the elderly and female working population that partially compensated the labour market tightness (Figure 9). That said, as Governor Ueda reports, the scope for further increases is limited. The labour force participation rate for people aged 65 and over was above 25% in 2024, while the current female labour force participation rate is comparable to Northern European economies. With monetary policy still very loose, it's clear the labor market has not eased yet in Japan partially because the BoJ is yet to normalize policy, as shown in Figure 10. As Governor Ueda puts it, \"Barring a major negative demand shock, the labor market is expected to remain tight and continue to exert upward pressure on wages.\" This dynamic also helps explain the 34- year high in this year's annual wage negotiation, and the pick- up in labour market mobility relative to historical highs (Figure 10).",

Larger shifts in FOMC membership have been top of mind for markets since the beginning of President Trump's recurrent critiques of Fed Chair Powell's monetary policy (NYT, 16- Jul- 25). Yet, the \"one- man risk\" of losing Powell as Chair may not be the Fed's biggest risk to the FOMC configuration. As flagged in a recent WSJ article (24- Aug- 25), the term of the presidents of the 12 Regional Federal Reserve Banks, which runs concurrently, are all set to end in February 2026. Once their terms are over, the 12 regional Fed chairs must be reappointed by the Board of Governors. The Board of Governors currently already has two President Trump appointees (Governors Waller and Bowman), while Stephen Miran is incoming. If the latest development on Governor Cook ends up in her exit, it could mean that the Board of Governors would soon have a dovish majority (4/7) (latest developments shown in Figure 13).",

While this is more a risk scenario for the market rather than the base case, the WSJ article reports that in 2022 both Governor Bowman and Waller abstained from voting to approve the appointment of Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to President Obama, as president of the Chicago Fed. Risk of a more dovish FOMC has two main market release valves, in our view: weaker USD and steeper curve. We are already both short USD (EURUSD topside digi with window KO, USDTRY digi put, long carry basket, AUDUSD up, oil down dual digi) and long the 6m 5s30s steepener (in 6m fwd 5s30s and in a 5s30s steeper, NDX higher dual digital; trade idea owned by Adam Pickett), and we added a small position to both themes earlier this week.",

Class B directors are chosen by private banks, but they cannot be bank employees. Class C directors are chosen directly by the Board of Governors. The search committee then interviews a range of potential candidates and forwards to the Board of Governors a list of finalist candidates, all of whom are interviewed by the governors.

One reason is the coincident news flow around France. First, we note that fiscal fears in France are nothing new, OATs have been underperforming all year (Figure 16) with consistently weak portfolio flows in recent years (Figure 17). We see similar stretched weakness from Rates Strategy's risk premia models (Figure 18). Market participants have been expecting further OAT underperformance (slowly) and legislative elections (next year). We think the no confidence vote, which is likely to fail (per Citi Economics), simply front loads this price action. We think there is limited evidence that the recent spread widening in OAT- Bund spreads could materially undermine appetite for the Euro. In Figure 20, we ran an event study looking at EURUSD performance during periods when OAT- Bund spreads are stretched. To identify these periods, we apply two conditions which mirror the recent price action in OAT- Bund spreads: 1) the 1y rolling z- score of weekly changes exceeds 2 sigma and 2) the absolute weekly change is at least \\(+10\\) bps. The latter condition ensures we do not unintentionally capture periods of very low volatility that are not analogous to the current environment. Finally, we exclude overlapping events within a six- month window.",

Strategies that are opened or closed differently than what is discussed in this document could have a significantly different outcome from what is described. It should be noted that certain Index options might have special settlement dates or settlement requirements that are different from traditional equity options. Commissions, taxes, and margin costs have not been included but will affect the outcome of any option transaction and should be considered. However, they can have a significant impact on the profitability of options transactions and should be considered carefully before entering into any option strategy. Because of the importance of tax considerations to all option transactions, the investor considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how their tax situation is affected by the outcome of contemplated options transactions. Certain options trades/strategies must be executed in a margin account. Transactions executed in a margin account can require the investor to periodically deposit additional collateral into the account in order to maintain the positions.

The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus. Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. Statements and views concerning ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors are typically based upon public statements made by the affected company or other public news, which the author may not have independently verified. ESG factors are one consideration that investors may choose to examine when making investment decisions. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",

Certain high- volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal or exceed the amount invested. The yield and average life of CMOs (collateralized mortgage obligations) referenced in this Product will fluctuate depending on the actual rate at which mortgage holders prepay the mortgages underlying the CMO and changes in current interest rates. Any government agency backing of the CMO applies only to the face value of the CMO and not to any premium paid. Certain investments contained in the Product may have tax implications for private customers whereby levels and basis of taxation may be subject to change. If in doubt, investors should seek advice from a tax adviser. The Product does not purport to identify the nature of the specific market or other risks associated with a particular transaction. Advice in the Product is general and should not be construed as personal advice given it has been prepared without taking account of the objectives, financial situation or needs of any particular investor. Accordingly, investors should, before acting on the advice, consider the appropriateness of the advice, having regard to their objectives, financial situation and needs. Prior to acquiring any financial product, it is the client's responsibility to obtain the relevant offer document for the product and consider it before making a decision as to whether to purchase the product.",
