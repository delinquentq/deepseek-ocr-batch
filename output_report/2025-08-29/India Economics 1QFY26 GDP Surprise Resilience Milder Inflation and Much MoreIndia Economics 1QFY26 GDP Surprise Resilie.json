Unseasonable rains in May- June negatively impacted some industrial activity, but manufacturing was resilient. Services recorded decade- high growth at \\(9.3\\% \\text{YoY}\\) .

While real GDP growth was 1.2pp higher than our forecast, the upside surprise in nominal GDP growth was much lower at 0.4pp. Nominal GDP grew \\(8.8\\%\\) YoY in 1QFY26 versus Citi's \\(8.4\\%\\) view, but more important, it was 2.0pp lower than the \\(10.8\\%\\) YoY in 4QFY25 (Mar- 25). This divergent trend in real and nominal growth was driven by the GDP deflator, which fell to an almost six- year low of \\(0.9\\%\\) YoY in 1QFY26, much lower than our expectation of \\(1.7\\%\\) YoY (versus \\(3.1\\%\\) in 4QFY25). Thus, better nominal growth explains one- third of the GDP surprise, while the remainder is driven by the lower deflator. This real- nominal gap is particularly visible in consumption growth.",

Construction sector growth also fell to around a two- year low but remained strong at \\(7.6\\%\\) YoY (10.8%). This likely reflects improved public capex activity.

      "text": "What explains the gap between decisively strong GDP data and the market's more bearish view on demand? For yet another quarter, GDP has surprised on the upside and might be much stronger than the market's view on economic activity. There could be some tentative explanations: (1) As we have discussed earlier, there has been a shift in consumption from goods to services, and this might be underrepresented in the high-frequency data tracked by the markets due to the higher share of the informal sector. (2) Nominal private consumption growth fell by 1.8pp, which is more in sync with the market view of depressed demand. It is often difficult for the market to accurately predict real demand growth, which is influenced by the often-volatile GDP deflator and the peculiarities of the single deflator method. (3) Government consumption growth rose sharply to \\(+7.4\\%\\) YoY in 1QFY26 from \\(-1.8\\%\\) YoY in 4QFY25. It is possible that a larger part of this non-capex spending is more rural-oriented, which is consistent with the market's view of urban-rural demand divergence.",

      "text": "Looking ahead — The shadow of uncertainty: Two key uncertainties impact the growth outlook for the remainder of FY26. First, the extent of stimulus from potential GST rate cuts remains unclear. On top of that, it might also be leading to a delay in consumption, impacting 2QFY26 (Sep- 25) activity. Second, a much bigger uncertainty relates to US tariffs, where both the continuation of the current tariff rate and the magnitude of impact are ambiguous. That said, for 2QFY26, the front- loading of exports, a favorable base from last year (+5.6% GDP growth in 2QFY25), and momentum from 1Q might keep real growth above 7%. For 2HFY26, we might see the positive impact from policy stimulus, but the base will be less favorable, and the tariff- related impact on activity will be more visible, likely pushing growth below 7%. Overall, we now see full- year FY26 real GDP growth at 7.1% YoY (previously 6.7%). This assumes 1H at 7.5% and 2H at 6.6% YoY. Our view about the inherent resilience of the economy and positive influence of \\(\\sim 1\\%\\) of GDP policy stimulus is playing out in the GDP data and partly explains why we had a FY26 growth forecast higher than the RBI's. On the other hand, we revise down our FY26 nominal GDP forecast to 8.4% YoY from 10.2% earlier. Annual GDP deflator could be at a multi- decade low in FY26 as both CPI and WPI remain subdued.",

Today, 29 August, India's chief economic advisor said that while there could be some negative shock on manufacturing activity, additional tariffs imposed by the US could be short-lived (Reuters, 29 August). That said, full-year FY26 growth could be below 7% if tariffs remain at current levels for the remainder of the year and the second-round effects of tariffs through the labor market start to become visible in the GDP data. It will be interesting to see how this 1Q GDP print alters the RBI's forecast of 6.5% GDP growth in FY26 which is likely to be revealed in the October MPC meeting. In isolation, we think this GDP print is not supportive of an October rate cut unless the RBI underplays it because of its backward-looking nature and focuses more on the forward-looking risks to growth. RBI MPC could be on a long hold barring any material tariff-related growth impact, which may not be visible by the October meeting.",

The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus. Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. Statements and views concerning ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors are typically based upon public statements made by the affected company or other public news, which the author may not have independently verified. ESG factors are one consideration that investors may choose to examine when making investment decisions. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",
