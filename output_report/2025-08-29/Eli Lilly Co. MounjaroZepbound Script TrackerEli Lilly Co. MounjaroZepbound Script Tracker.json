LLY IR noted that the NHS- agreed price will remain unchanged; however, list prices to pharmacies will increase across all doses, resulting in higher out- of- pocket costs for private patients. Per news report the increase in prices could range from \\(\\sim 30\\%\\) for lower doses to \\(>100\\%\\) for higher strengths. The adjustment follows a pricing review that initially set the UK launch price lower to support early access during global GLP- 1 supply constraints; with broader availability and stronger clinical validation, LLY is now aligning prices internationally. The change aims to reduce the risk of UK supply being exported to higher- priced markets, support fair contribution toward ongoing R&D investment, and ensure consistent global access.",

This strategy deviates significantly from the CVS/Caremark approach above. We previously connected with LLY IR on the Cigna/Evernorth news (see HERE) who noted: (1) it's an open access agreement, which is aligned with the company's contracting strategy (as discussed on their IQ call - see HERE), (2) the first part of the agreement is that Cigna is advertising a new offering (\\$200 co- pay cap plan) as a way for employers to opt- in to obesity coverage at a lower cost to employers. There is an employer/Cigna cost on top of the \\$200 patient co- pay, (3) the second part of the agreement is open access for Zepbound and Wegovy into 2026 on the basic template lives managed by ESI. LLY will not provide further details here, but noted that the impact on pricing is aligned with the company's expectations, and (4) there are no changes to the company's 2025 portfolio pricing guidance of mid- to- high single digit price decline.
