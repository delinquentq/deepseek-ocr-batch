      "text": "The European Luxury Goods sector was up \\(+5\\%\\) this week, outperforming the MSCI Europe Index \\((- 1\\%)\\) . The broader sector- wide re- rating was supported by a positive conference call hosted by Swatch \\((+5\\%)\\) to address the US tariff situation (following the introduction of the \\(39\\%\\) duty on Swiss imports), which flagged a very healthy and resilient American consumer throughout the year. This continued into Q3 to date (July+August sales for the Swatch Group were said to be up around \\(20\\%\\) ), remaining robust and showing no push back to the price increases implemented so far. Most luxury stocks rallied, led by those with lighter investor positioning (Burberry up another \\(10\\%\\) , Prada \\(+8\\%\\) , Kering \\(+7\\%\\) , Moncler and LVMH \\(+6\\%\\) ). Talking to investors this week, the tone is indeed becoming more constructive, with most of our conversations looking to revisit the sector, encouraged by the robust data emerging from the US (further confirmed by most American retailers reporting this week), as well as the potential for a recovery of the Chinese consumer (thanks to the wealth effect from rallying stock markets and Macau gaming names showing accelerating trends) from here. We are mindful though that coming out of Q2 reporting the tone on the Chinese cluster, specifically from luxury companies, was still not that positive, noting an overall slowdown of the cluster in Q2 (due to softening tourist spending) and no material changes in current trading, at least as of yet. Brunello Cucinelli \\((+3\\%)\\) this week and up \\(1\\%\\) as we write) also confirmed the continuation of trends (very positive for the brand, as they have consistently been throughout the year) at its H1 results yesterday, with \"no material effect on the willingness to buy\" in North America, \"a very good summer\" in Europe and \"very positive\" performance in China.",

JD also announced a new £100m share buyback programme, indicating a confident outlook. Among JD's US peers, Dick's Sporting Goods reported very strong Q2 results and raised guidance, seeing broad- based strength and no signs of a consumer slowdown. Foot Locker also reported a sequential improvement in the US, with a positive start to the Back To School season. In contrast, trends at Chinese sporting goods brands were weak, with both Anta and Li Ning seeing a sequential acceleration in Q3 to date, albeit Anta management expects an improvement in demand in September.",

The comments on the call sparked a rally in the luxury sector as Mr. Hayek noted that: 1) despite the price increases implemented in Q2 (5- 8% varying by brand) and the general macro volatility, the US consumer remains strong, with robust current trading in July and August to date; and 2) a second round of price increases at 5- 10% will be sufficient to absorb the higher duty. Swatch also noted that it had increased its stock levels in North America from six months worth of sales to 10 months. The call focused on the US situation, with no further details on current trading in other regions. See more in our note Take- aways from the US tariff situation call",
