As we think about 2H and the full year, we have about \\(0.02 of bad debts incorporated into our guidance in 2H, and we are being a little conservative on a few other line items (op ex leakage, taxes). As a result, we can envision a path for O to potentially come in toward the high end of its range this year if a few things work in its favor, but we don't think there is much room at this point for the range to move up in a material way, even with sizable deal flow and also having come off a slightly softer 2Q.",
