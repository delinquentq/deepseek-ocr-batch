We view positively Bear's: 1) diversified product portfolio supported by strong innovation capability that has nurtured various blockbuster products, which have been well- received especially among the younger generation. The company has been increasing offerings of mature products to balance growth and innovation risks. We believe it still has strong potential in terms of category expansion and share gains. 2) Bear has been flexible in its channel strategy as evidenced by early movers in both online and live- streaming segments. However, we think the positives have been priced in a valuation premium over peers. We see fair risk/reward with still sluggish demand and intensifying competition in the short- term, thus we rate the stock Neutral.",
