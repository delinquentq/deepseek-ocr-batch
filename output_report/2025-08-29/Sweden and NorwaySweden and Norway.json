The minutes from the August meeting were slightly more dovish than the press conference and the statement, with members assessing economic activity to be weak.

While higher-than-expected inflation in June-July prevented such a move, the Board also assessed that the recent upturn was most likely temporary, driven by a few volatile items. If inflation were to correct lower in the coming months, members appeared open to ease again.",
