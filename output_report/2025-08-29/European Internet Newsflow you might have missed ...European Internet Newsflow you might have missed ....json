In 2Q25, Meituan's gross margin dropped -8ppts yoy, S&M expenses were up 52% yoy, and operating cash flow declined -75% yoy while only delivering a 8% yoy top-line growth for the core local commerce segment. Key comments on call around Keeta: 1) Meituan reiterated its intention to become a global company, with Keeta as the international growth vehicle, but emphasised a measured approach to market entry. 2) The company highlighted rapid progress in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia, where Keeta has already reached top-tier market positions, and noted recent expansion into Qatar. 3) Brazil remains under evaluation, with a small team conducting market research. 4) Management remains optimistic about Keeta's long-term potential, targeting RMB100bn GMV by 2033, while stressing the importance of local market understanding and operational discipline.",

Boohoo is in the early stages of a multi-year turnaround strategy. Performance recovery of the company now rests on three key pillars: scaling Debenhams' asset-light marketplace model across the Group, expanding margins, and 'right-sizing' the Youth Brands, which we view as the most structurally challenged. While Debenhams is showing encouraging growth, its current scale is small (~£650m GMV). We remain cautious on the feasibility of replicating the asset-light model across the Youth Brands, where operational complexity and brand positioning may limit its effectiveness. Although the mid-term strategy is becoming clearer, we believe it will take time to translate into results, and Boohoo's outlook remains challenged.",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
