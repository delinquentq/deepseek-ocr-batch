Recurring NP came at Rmb2.4bn (up by \\(49\\%\\) yoy from a low base), ahead of GSe by \\(4\\%\\) . The company hosted an earnings briefing on Aug 29, and key takeaways include: 1) For 2025E, management maintains existing guidance of \\(9\\%\\) NPM with positive expectation on liquid milk recovery faster than industry- level, future market share gain for cheese, continuous sales expansion on infant formula/ice cream in 2H. 2) cycle outlook: mgmt. sees gradually improving S/D dynamics in raw milk with likely more capacity exit and price recovery into 2026. The company is still observing demand trend of liquid milk into peak season while it remained weak in Jul/Aug. 3) key strategies: the company will keep investing in new channels on customized dairy/higher- end nutrition/Infant formula products for future sales growth opportunities, while at the same time hope for gradual recovery of liquid milk business. The company managed to achieve positive growth for Yousuanru/Shuhua milk and fresh milk (up \\(20\\% +\\) in 1H25). 4) Volume/pricing strategy: the company also launched value- for- money products in liquid milk but saw still largely steady pricing trend in 1H25 with its stringent pricing/inventory level control for Satine; 5) shareholder return: the company maintained no less than \\(70\\%\\) dividend payout ratio for 2025 with slightly higher/stable dividend amount on better profit outlook vs 2024 (NP at Rmb8,453mn in 2024). As of last close, the stock is trading at \\(17\\times /16\\times 2025 / 26E\\) with \\(5.6\\% /5.8\\%\\) dividend yield, respectively.
