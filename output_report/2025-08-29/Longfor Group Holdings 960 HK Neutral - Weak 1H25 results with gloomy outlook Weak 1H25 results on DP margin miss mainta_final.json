However, core net profit dropped by \\(c.70\\%\\) y- y to CNY1.4bn in 1H25, largely in line with its profit warning, as DP profitability further deteriorated (1H25 GPM: \\(0.2\\%\\) , - 7.2pp y- y). On a positive note, Longfor's leverage continued to improve; interest- bearing debt reduced by CNY6.5bn h- h and average financing cost fell to a historical low of \\(3.58\\%\\) . Looking ahead, we expect the gross margin of Longfor's property sales segment to remain under pressure due to the low margin profile of unbooked presales. For FY25F, we now forecast a slightly negative DP gross margin and anticipate more impairments, thus cutting our core earnings forecast to CNY3.1bn (- \\(56\\%\\) y- y). We see no company- specific catalysts to drive Longfor's share price and thus remain Neutral.",

The company operated 89 shopping malls in 1H25 with a high occupancy rate of \\(97\\%\\) , delivering \\(17\\%\\) y- y growth of total mall sales (SSSG: \\(+3\\%\\) ); ten additional malls are scheduled to open in 2H25F, and we expect its rental income growth to accelerate in FY26F after renovations at its core malls are completed. Meanwhile, Longfor's emerging construction segment recorded contracted sales of CNY8.4bn and delivered 1.22mn sqm in 1H25, continuing to expand its full- cycle construction services. While these segments should support longer- term earnings sustainability, we believe the current scale remains insufficient to offset the weakness of its core DP business ( \\(77\\%\\) revenue contribution in 1H25).",

Meanwhile, we lower our target NAV discount to \\(45\\%\\) (from \\(55\\%\\) ), to reflect the capital market's improving sentiment towards the company's China assets, in- line with our adjustments for other leading developers. We thus arrive at a target price of HKD10.70 (from HKD9.50; Fig2). Longfor currently trades at a 20.9x FY25F P/E. We prefer Beike (BEKE US, Buy) in the property value chain.",
