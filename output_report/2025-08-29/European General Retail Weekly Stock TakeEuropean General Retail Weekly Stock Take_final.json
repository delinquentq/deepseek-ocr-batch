Most of our coverage was in negative territory led by the UK names, as the theme of a potentially softer UK consumer into the end of the year gained traction, exacerbated by particularly soft Asda income tracker data (slowest rate of growth since May- 23 and, perhaps more importantly, middle income quintile spending power going backwards you for the first time in two years). We published our Aug chartbook this week where we discussed this theme in more detail. Kingfisher \\((- 6\\%)\\) and ABF \\((- 6\\%)\\) were the worst performers, with both also dragged by a broker downgrade. Soft Polish retail sales data for the DIY category was also unhelpful for the former. \\(\\mathsf{H}\\& \\mathsf{M}\\) \\((- 1\\%)\\) and ITX (flat) slightly outperformed, helped by US retail reporting that was overall solid, including robust trading commentary in Jul and Aug, albeit a clear theme from the US retail group was also higher margin pressure from tariffs than previously communicated (see our quotes section for collated comments on both current trading and tariff pressure from the US clothing retailers). The E- commerce sector was down \\(- 1\\%\\) , in line with the broader market. Zalando (flat) slightly outperformed, possibly helped by strong Polish clothing retail sales data (recall that Zalando has DD% sales exposure to Poland).",

Recall the group had previously confirmed that it is planning to open 20 new stores in the UK in 2025 as part of the 2024-2026 strategic growth plan (we discussed Mango's global Strategic Plan in our PODCAST last year here). On outlook, management commented that \"the directors hope for growth in the future as well as to improve the financial results of the company...the current economic conditions create uncertainty over the level of demand within the retail sector\". For context, Mango group sales increased by 12% ex-FX in FY 24 (supported by 10% new space) to €3.3bn, meaning that the UK represented c.5% group sales. In H1 25 Mango sales increased by 14% ex-FX.",

PDD's disclosure on Temu continues to be very limited, although JPM China Internet analyst, Andre Chang, thinks data points suggest that it is still achieving fast growth even amid the US/China dispute over tariffs. For the overall group in Q3, JPM expects margins to drop (with a question mark over 2026) with one of four key factors being Temu marketing spending.

      "text": "- Debenhams group (previously boohoo) released FY 25 (to end-Feb) results. Recall that the group is pursuing a sale of the recently relaunched PLT brand (which represented c.31% of GMV post returns in FY 25, and was slightly loss marking by c.£-2m at the EBITDA level). FY 25 GMV was down -8% yoy (BBG cons -4%) and total sales -17% yoy (BBG cons -14%). Excluding the PLT brand, GMV was up +1% yoy and total sales -12% yoy. Management referenced \"the standout performance\" of the Debenhams brand with GMV +34% yoy. Management also commented that \"strong growth in categories such as Beauty & Home have strengthened the breadth of the offer. Youth Brands' performance has been impacted by cost-of-living challenges\". Gross margin was down -100bps yoy to 50.7% (-50bps yoy ex PLT) vs BBG cons 50.9% driven by increased promotional activity primarily in Youth Brands \"to drive trade in a difficult consumer environment\", offsetting the mix benefit of increased marketplace revenues with a higher gross margin. EBITDA -33% yoy to £39.6m (or ex PLT +3% yoy to £41.6m) vs cons £40.4m. EBIT remained a loss, although improved yoy to £-21m (BBG cons £-36m). Management also discussed how it has \"significantly reduced the capital intensity of the business. We have faced into legacy stock issues and reduced our stock holding by more than 50%. We have stopped unnecessary capital expenditure and reduced capex by more than 50%. Further reductions will be delivered this financial year\". On guidance, management expects H1 26 EBITDA (from continuing operations, that is ex-PLT) to be ahead of H1 25 (cons £20.5m, H1 25 EBITDA £20.8m). Management commented that \"the UK consumer environment is challenging, seems to be getting more challenging, and lots of talk about it continuing to be challenging going forward\" but commented that the UK government considering changes to the de minimis rule could present a potential opportunity. On pricing in the US in response to tariffs, management commented that \"we've obviously priced up in order to protect ourselves from tariffs associated with China... We have seen a slowdown in our US performance in those markets, and we've taken appropriate action from a margin and a marketing point of view to protect ourselves\". On the potential sale of the PLT brand, management commented that \"We've noted with interest some of the interesting changing dynamics of macroeconomic situation relating to that fast fashion world, notably with the changes that have taken place in North America and the impact of that has had on a number of major global players... we see the opportunity to potentially realize significant value through a potential sale to a strategic partner of our PLT plans\". The group is also assessing long-term options for the US and Burnley distribution sites \"to enhance efficiency and ensure alignment with our stock-lite strategy\".",
