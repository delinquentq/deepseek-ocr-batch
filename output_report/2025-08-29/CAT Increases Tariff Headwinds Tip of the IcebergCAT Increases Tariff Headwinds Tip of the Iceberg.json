The incremental change of +&#36;100mn in 3Q and +&#36;250mn (midpt) for the full year equates to an EPS headwind of &#36;0.15/shr and ~&#36;0.40/shr, respectively. The updated tariff impact made no change to the company's sales outlook which is an expectation for \"sales to improve slightly for the year\". Margins are now expected fall within the bottom half of the company's previously sketched range for the revenue profile (Ex.1) with the bulk of the incremental costs flowing into the CI business. Looking ahead, the 4Q25 run rate for tariffs would appear to be ~&#36;800mn which would suggest an incremental headwind of ~&#36;1.5B or ~&#36;2.40/shr in 2026, although we expect some cost and price offset.",

Companies understandably don't want to adjust to tariff levels only to have them change again. This suggests to us that initial tariff impacts will be at least shared if not largely borne by manufacturing companies in the near term. As time progresses, and 'pre-tariff' inventories of machines and parts are drawn down we expect to see more actions including supply chain adjustments, productivity and pricing. Longer term, CAT has a strong record of margin expansion, and we expect recapture to begin next year.",
