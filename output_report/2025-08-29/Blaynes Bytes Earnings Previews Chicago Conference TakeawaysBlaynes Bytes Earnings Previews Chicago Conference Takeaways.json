      "text": "2025 Chicago Conference Takeaways: Our annual conference just wrapped up with roughly 100 companies in attendance. Optical was the brightest area with LITE favored given a more incremental 800G/1.6T ramp vs COHR but both should see tailwinds. 200G/lane should also push more active cabling, which is a 2026 driver for both ACCs (MTSI and SMTC) and AECs (CRDO and ALAB). MTSI is one of our favorite names given strong ramps in A&D and Telco and this DC opportunity layering on top. The messaging from Analog remained constructive but with seasonality swinging negative, the broader recovery is likely a 2026 story. In SPE, AMAT did seem to be more of an anomaly with others not pointing to China weakness. LRXC sounded very confident in its competitive position with drivers such as Moly, but it's hard to avoid the Memory overhang for the group. Memory is the area where investors were the most negative as there are fears that a Samsung HBM qualification would likely cause an oversupply and NAND fears circle around a softer demand profile pushing pricing lower. Please see our full conference note HERE (including company specific breakdowns) and replay from our takeaways call HERE!",

We see potential for \\(>\\) 2B in upside to the Semi Solutions business, led by TPU sales approaching \\(3 - 4B\\) , networking strong across the board, and significant growth in the non- AI business given the significant upside in MRVL's Enterprise/Carrier businesses guiding up \\(30\\%\\) in October. GMs could take a small hit from the increased ASIC mix but the Street of \\(77.8\\%\\) seems reasonable if strength in Switching and Non- AI helps offset. Overall, we think positioning is mixed into the print with those seeking AI exposure with relative safety still involved, but others worried about the catalyst path moving forward while we wait for proof points on future AI ASIC ramps and the potential for growth next year in the Software business. The upside in the quarter should be seen positively, but we wouldn't expect to see any big updates to the ASIC roadmap which is driving the valuation.",

The DC business is expected to be flat Q/Q (implying Custom business down DD % Q/Q) but Custom expected to grow in 2H vs 1H (implies significant bounce back in Q4). MRVL shifted to less customer specific commentary regarding ASIC programs at its AI day and therefore didn't reiterate that its lead ASIC customer will grow in C26. Nonetheless, progressing well on \\(18+\\) XPU sockets (vs 18 prior) with several already in volume production and announced scale- up switching opportunity in UAL and Ethernet for AI workloads. Initial volume shipments for 1.6T DSPs have already begun and the stronger optical market should be a continued tailwind for the business. Overall, we see the MSFT opportunity in late C26 as the much bigger story driver but Alchip share- loss concerns will continue until there is more visibility on the ASIC business.
