Europe, for example, saw its tariff come in at \\(15\\%\\) across the board, implying that tariffs on autos will be 10pp lower than first announced (see Jari Stehn's Aug- 1 note, \"European Views: As Good As It Gets\" and Elsie Peng's Aug- 10 update, \"Tariff Passthrough Update: More Underway Through June\" for our latest view on how tariffs are being absorbed by the US economy).",

Fed Chair Alan Greenspan coined this phrase back in late 1996, capturing his concerns around inflated asset valuations in the wake of a sharp rally in stocks that took place following a steady Fed funds rate hiking cycle that ended in mid-1995. Fast forward to today, and we are seeing similar characteristics in some corners of the market just before what many expect will be a sustained Fed funds rate cutting cycle re-starting at the September FOMC meeting (see Mericle's Aug-17 note, \"Slower Job Growth Makes the Case for a Cut\"). David Kostin points out in the Aug-22 \"US Kickstart\" that the S&P 500 is now trading at 23X NTM earnings estimates. Ben Snider also highlighted in a Jul-24 note, \"Speculative trading activity adds fuel to narrow-breadth short squeeze,\" how a spike in trading activity in unprofitable stocks, penny stocks, and stocks with elevated EV/sales multiples pushed our Speculative Trading Indicator (STI) to its highest level outside of 1998-2001 and 2020-2021 (both periods that were soon followed by Tech stock crashes).",
