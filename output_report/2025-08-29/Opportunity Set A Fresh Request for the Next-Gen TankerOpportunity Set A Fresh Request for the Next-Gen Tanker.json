The NGAS program was launched in 2023 with an RFI, and an RFI last year focused on the propulsion systems. Engine capabilities are to be defined in three intervals - 6, 10, and 15 years from that date, likely to inform the development timeline of NGAS. The Air Force had previously announced it would accelerate the NGAS program rather than funding a bridge tanker following the existing buy of 179 KC- 46s. The proposals must be submitted by October 24. The existing tankers are built by BA with the KC- 46 (767 derived) and the KC- 135 (first introduced in 1950). NGAS would enter service in the 2040 timeframe (although some timelines suggest mid- 2030s.).",

The KC- 46 Tanker is a contract that was awarded in 2011 from the US Air Force, with the USAF authorizing 10 LRIP lots over 139 aircraft since 2016. Total charges during 2022 were \\(1,374\\mathrm{MM}\\) , driven by schedule delays on the Remote Vision System, as well as continued production disruptions due to labor shortages and supply chain disruption, w/ reduced benefits from prior investments. BA took charges of \\(309\\mathrm{MM}\\) during 2023 tied primarily to a supplier quality issue. In July 2023, BA resumed commercial 767 deliveries, with Air Force deliveries resuming thereafter for the surface coating non- conformance on the centering fuel tanks. Lot 10 was awarded in Nov 2023 for 15 tankers, with Lot 11 expected in Q4:24. BA took a \\(128\\mathrm{MM}\\) charge on the program in Q1:24 and \\(391\\mathrm{MM}\\) in Q2:24 due to supply chain and factory instability. BA took an additional \\(661\\mathrm{MM}\\) in Q3:24 tied to higher than anticipated factory disruptions, including those related to the IAM union negotiations. Q4:24 included a further \\(0.8\\mathrm{BB}\\) charge tied to higher manufacturing costs, in part due to the IAM work stoppage, bringing total charges to \\(2.0\\mathrm{BB}\\) in 2024. Meanwhile, RVS 2.0 operational testing extends into 2026 now. The focus for KC- 46A is now on stabilizing and improving output productivity. BA delivered 5 KC- 46s in Q2.",
