While the energy transition remains an overarching theme, history has shown that renewable energy build- out at scale does not necessarily translate into returns at all points of the value chain. Industry cycles, technological advancement, and geopolitics all come into play. In this report, we give10 answers to questions relating to the transition on three main topics: 1) Which transition value chains are in supply tightness or emerging as important ones? 2) Where are geopolitical risks less well understood? 3) Which transition technologies will be the next game changers? JPM- covered stocks that emerge as our top picks include: Bannerman Energy (BMN), CATL- A, Hyundai Electric, Hyosung Heavy, ILU, LG Chem, LG Energy Solution, Orient Cables, Sieyuan and Tenaga.",

While this would normally be considered a significant headwind, the global policy easing and China liquidity surge currently underway is providing a strong counter force. In this context, we believe the equity bull market will remain intact and any correction/consolidation will present a buying opportunity. However, it is important to manage risks where positioning is particularly crowded. Looking across LO, HF and Quant investors, we note the highest crowding in Taiwan Tech/Semis and Indo Financials, followed by China Growth stocks (semis, consumer and biotech). Alongside this, ongoing support from monetary policy should eventually warrant a widening of the leadership and outperformance of Cyclicals. We are upgrading the Materials sector to OW in the AxJ region following our recent allocation changes in India (see report). Within the AxJ region, our pecking order is Korea > India > China > Taiwan > ASEAN. Our key OWs are: China Tech, Internet, Healthcare, Materials, select Financial/Industrials; India Financials, Consumer ex Auto, Materials, Real Estate, Hospitals, select power/defense; Korea Financials, Tech, Holdco; TSMC in Taiwan; and ASEAN Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Healthcare, IT.",
