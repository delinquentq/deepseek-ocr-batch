When entering into CDS transactions, the protection buyer will be required to pledge or entrust an agreed amount of margin collateral. In some of these cases, the transaction payments may exceed the amount of margin collateral. There shall be no advance notification of required collateral value or collateral ratios as they vary depending on the financial position of the protection buyer. CDS transactions carry the risk of losses owing to changes in the credit position of some or all of the referenced entities, and/or fluctuations of the interest rate market. The amount the protection buyer receives in the event that the CDS is triggered by a credit event may undercut the total amount of premiums that he/she has paid in the course of the transaction. Similarly, the amount the protection seller pays in the event of a credit event may exceed the total amount of premiums that he/she has received in the transaction. All other conditions being equal, the amount of premiums that the protection buyer pays and that received by the protection seller shall differ. In principle, CDS transactions will be limited to financial instruments business operators and qualified institutional investors. Transfers of equities to another securities company via the Japan Securities Depository Center are subject to a transfer fee of up to ¥11,000 (tax included) per issue transferred depending on volume. No account fee will be charged for marketable securities or monies deposited.",
