We had anticipated soft IP growth in early 3Q25 based on high- frequency data for automobile production and tech production patterns indicating a weak start to the quarter. However, the actual data showed stronger performance in tech production and non- auto/tech production. In terms of three- month trend growth, IP contracted by \\(6.2\\% 3\\mathrm{m / 3m}\\) ,saur due to a base effect, but the trend growth is likely to improve later in 3Q25 (Figure 1).",
