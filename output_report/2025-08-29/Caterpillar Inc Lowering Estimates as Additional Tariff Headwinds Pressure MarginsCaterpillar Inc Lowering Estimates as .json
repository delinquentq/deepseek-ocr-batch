Specifically, it now sees its 2025 net tariff headwind to be in the range of \\(\\) 1.5 - 1.8B\\(\\) \\ \\(1.3 - 1.5B\\) previously) and its 3Q25 headwind in the range of \\(\\) 500 - 600M\\(\\) \\ \\(400 - 500M\\) previously). Accordingly, CAT now expects its 2025 adj. operating profit to be \"near the bottom of the target margin range\" vs. bottom half of the target margin range prior. Based on the company's revenue outlook, we believe this implies full year margins will now be approaching \\(\\sim 16\\%\\) . According to the company, the updated guide largely reflects: 1) the amendment of the section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week (HERE), which adds 400+ HTUS codes to the list of items for which steel and aluminum content will be tariffed at \\(50\\%\\) . Importantly, the expanded codes now include certain agriculture machinery, construction machinery, and rail locomotives; and 2) the increased tariff of \\(50\\%\\) on India imports.",

However, our concern remains that CAT and the construction equipment group have thus far exhibited little to no ability to pass through tariffs. As such, the combination of incremental tariff headwinds with higher discounting reserves taken by Deere (DE) for its construction business all bode negatively for CAT's ability to mitigate the incremental risk. As a result of the increased tariff impact, we now lower our 2025 adj. operating profit margins by \\(\\sim 40\\) bps to \\(16.3\\%\\) and adj. EPS by - \\(2\\%\\) to \\(\\) 17.13\\(, putting us even further below consensus for the year. See Exhibit 1 below for a summary of our estimate changes.",
