That said, mgmt guided down for 2H25E is very large, expecting flat revenue for full year (implying -12% yoy in 2H25E vs. -9% in 1H25) and 2025E net profit to be Rmb2bn with 2H similar to 1H's Rmb1.0bn. The worse outlook is mainly because its new product launch is behind schedule due to longer-than-expected registration, while existing product has fully penetrated, plus industry sales deteriorated since 2Q25 with birth decline. 2025E dividend plan of minimum Rmb2.0bn is unchanged (interim Rmb1.0bn declared), implying 5.5% yield. Share repurchase plan of Rmb1.0bn by end 2025 (for staff incentive program) is still on. Maintain Neutral with lower TP of HK\\(4.3 (from HK\\)5.5).",

Mgmt started to reduce supply volume in 2Q25 in order to recover channel price. Now channel inventories were down to half month for Zhuorui and one month for Astrobaby, the five-year low per mgmt. Mgmt expects the destocking to gradually complete in Sep and sales to recover in 4Q25E vs 3Q25E. Sales of all stages declined in 1H25, while stage 3 outperformed industry and stage 1 underperformed. Market share slid 1ppt to 18.2%, still No. 1 brand. Mgmt expects new product under registration application to help drive future sales, but timetable is unclear.",

The significant decline was mainly dragged by the negative margin of other dairy products such as milk powder and light cream, which were to digest the excessive raw milk produced by its dairy farming subsidiaries. Mgmt expects smaller dilution from such business in 2H25E than in 1H25 as it has reduced the milklable cow size to lower the raw milk production. GPM of milk formula products was stable by our estimate. S&D/sales also decreased as it cut A&P alongside sell-in reduction.",

Feihe announced 1H25 preliminary net profit to decline \\(36 - 47\\%\\) yoy on an \\(8 - 10\\%\\) revenue decline and margin contraction, below our expectations. We think the weakness was due to unexpected competition from major IMF players' subsidy programs against a soft demand backdrop. As qualified customers can obtain free products from all the subsidy programs launched by Feihe and competitors, they are able to exchange among themselves products of their preferred brand, which led to a sales decline. We expect the share price to react negatively on weak earnings in the near term, while the dividend yield and buybacks could provide some support afterwards. New upside catalysts appear limited after the rollout of the national childcare subsidy.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note.
