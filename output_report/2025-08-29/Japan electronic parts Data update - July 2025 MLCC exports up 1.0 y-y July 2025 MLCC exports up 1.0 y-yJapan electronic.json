As discussed below, overall MLCC exports were sluggish because of negative growth in exports to Hong Kong owing to differences in the timing of shipments of MLCCs for the new iPhone, but we expect them to recover sharply from August as the impact of yen appreciation eases.",

The product mix for MLCCs used in consumer electronics improved modestly m- m, partly thanks to demand related to the new iPhone (Figure 6). The only countries and regions that saw declines in exports were Hong Kong (down \\(17.5\\%\\) ), Europe (down \\(8.1\\%\\) ), and the US (down \\(5.1\\%\\) ). Average value- added (which is correlated with the gross margin at MLCC producers), a measure of the MLCC product mix, improved modestly from \\(1.00 / g\\) in June to \\(1.02 / g\\) in July. This is broadly in line with \\(1.03 / g\\) in July 2024. As noted above, we think shipments of high- end MLCCs for the iPhone were lower in July 2025 than in July 2024. But for this, average value- added would probably have risen thanks to improvements in the product mix for AI server applications.",

First, exports to Taiwan accounted for \\(15.8\\%\\) of total exports of MLCCs and \\(17.9\\%\\) of total exports of aluminum electrolytic capacitors in July (Figures 7, 8). Second, exports were up \\(33\\%\\) y- y for MLCCs and up \\(75\\%\\) for aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Third, July 2025 export value was \\(1.14x\\) the peak monthly export value prior to 2024 for MLCCs (peak of June 2024) and \\(1.67x\\) for aluminum electrolytic capacitors (peak of October 2024). We think the Blackwell generation uses more aluminum electrolytic capacitors (Panasonic SP- Caps). Moreover, demand for AI server applications has been growing strongly, and their power supply circuitry involves similar products to those used in EVs. We do not expect capacitor manufacturers to have to engage in additional capex for the time being as they will be able to divert the capacity they expanded for EV applications to AI server applications instead.",
