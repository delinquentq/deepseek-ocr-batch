The statement spells out clearly that a \"failure to observe a significant slowdown in the pace of inflation in the coming months would provide grounds for tightening monetary conditions\" along with a clarification that the MPC \"will assess the appropriateness of raising the base rate at its upcoming meetings.\" NBK is ready to hike its key rate even though starting September reserve requirements will be hiked and overall monetary conditions tightened.",

A hike was a real possibility and some market participants expected it, but it would have deviated somewhat from prior communications. In addition, it could have given the impression that NBK is reacting to the exchange rate depreciation - which could be a tricky path to be on given FX volatility in Kazakhstan. NBK sold a low amount of only US \\(125.6 million in late July and that was enough to stop the tense weakening. While tense remains around 540/USD, this is below the peak of about KZT 550/USD reached at the end of July.",

And upside inflationary risks remain significant, as clearly underscored in the NBK statement where \"fiscal discipline, stronger domestic demand, an acceleration in external inflation, unanchored inflation expectations, and second- round effects from increases in regulated prices and VAT\" are highlighted. If inflation does not slow in August - which we will learn next week - then a policy rate hike likely becomes the baseline for NBK. Our current forecast is for a marginal slowing in headline CPI but not in core.",

We have been highlighting the risks of a policy rate hike and those risks are much greater now, but not enough to be our baseline. At least not yet. Our inflation forecast has not changed in the past several months, while NBK has pushed its short- term forecast slightly higher (Table 1). The new range is \\(11\\% - 12.5\\%\\) compared to \\(10.5\\% - 12.5\\%\\) previously, probably on passthrough from the weaker FX. In our inflation forecast, we assume that the KZT weakens further during 4Q25 (around KZT550/USD) which likely explains why our forecast is on the high side of the NBK forecast range.",
