We are positive on the operating trends of E- town and expect its 3Q25E revenues to grow \\(9\\%\\) QoQ to Rmb1.4bn, while GM remains stable at \\(36\\%\\) , and net income to grow \\(15\\%\\) QoQ to Rmb150m. We see long- term upside on the company, given that (1) E- Town is riding on China semiconductor capex upward trend (China WFE updates), (2) product expansion from dry stripping to RTP and dry etching, (3) continuous R&D with more SKUs. The stock currently trades at \\(68.2\\times 2026\\) PE, close to our target PE multiple of \\(70.5x\\) reflecting that positives are largely priced in. With less upside than across our coverage in Greater China Tech, we maintain Neutral rating on E- town.",
