We forecast operating profits of ¥166.5bn in 25/12 (up 14% y- y) and ¥185.1bn in 26/12 (up 11%). We also assume annual share buybacks of ¥80bn through 27/12, taking into account Kao's high levels of cash & equivalents as a result of improved margins. The GC business overseas has been problematic, but restructuring of the earnings base is yielding results, and we still see upside versus our forecasts if efforts to increase sales of mainstay UV care products pay off. We reiterate our Buy rating. We obtain our target price of ¥7,850 by multiplying our 26/12 EPS forecast of ¥307.8 by a P/E of 25- 26x (previously 28- 29x our 25/12 EPS forecast). This represents a 15% premium over the average P/E of about 22x for toiletries companies under our coverage. We had previously valued the shares at a 20% premium to the benchmark average, but we now narrow this premium to reflect a smaller gap in profit growth rates versus the benchmark.",

Many categories within the Japanese toiletries market (including laundry detergent, where Kao holds the top share) are dominated by a small number of producers, creating a virtuous cycle in which companies are able to push through price hikes in their areas of strength. We envision ongoing earnings growth thanks to sustained price hikes, including additional price increases of \\(10 - 15\\%\\) in the fabric & home care segment from end- June 2025, and the launch of high- priced merchandise in the UV and hair care product categories as well. In 25/12, we expect the cosmetics segment to be profitable at the operating level for the first time since 19/12 (when we estimate the segment had profits of around ¥29.0bn and an operating margin of about \\(12\\%\\) ).

Restructuring measures (such as withdrawal from disposable diaper production in China in 2023 and organizational reforms at the health beauty care business in Europe in 2024) have resulted in cost efficiency gains and associated improvement in earnings. As a consequence, we think Kao is making progress in building an earnings base that can generate future earnings growth. The challenge going forward will be to achieve profit growth via top- line growth. In Europe and the Americas in particular, performance has been mixed even among similar categories, with weak sales for long- standing brands such as Goldwell and Jergens, but strong sales for brands acquired in recent years, such as Oribe and Bondi Sands. Kao management is aware of these issues, which it plans to address by launching new products and through the horizontal roll- out of new marketing strategies from H2 onward. While we do not currently envision any major profit growth at the overseas health beauty care business (partly due to proactive marketing spend), we are starting to see results from initiatives such as getting major Western retail chains to stock Kao's mainstay UV care products. Accordingly, we see upside versus our earnings forecasts if increased brand awareness and marketing initiatives translate into further sales growth.",

We now expect the company to continue with share buybacks of \\(\\yen 80bn\\) a year through 27/12, when the K27 medium- term business plan ends. This is because we expect cash & equivalents to substantially exceed annual working capital over the next two years, as major capex under the current medium- term business plan has run its course, and as we expect profitability improvements to boost Kao's ability to generate operating cash flow. Also, we think Kao would struggle to meet its 27/12 ROIC target of \\(11\\%\\) without further buybacks.",

As Kao's plan was to invest around \\(\\yen 225bn\\) through 25/12, we assume an average of about \\(\\yen 70bn\\) from 26/12 onward. The startup of a new US chemical plant means that major investment planned for this period is now largely complete. In terms of (2), the company plans to raise dividends for a 36th straight year in 25/12, the longest such stretch for a Japanese company, and to continue raising dividends thereafter. On (3), even if the company continues to carry out \\(\\yen 80bn\\) in annual share buybacks through 2027, it will still have cash & equivalents of at least \\(\\yen 300bn\\) at the end of each fiscal year, more than sufficient for annual working capital of around \\(\\yen 250bn\\) .",

At the GC business in Japan, we expect the hot weather and price hikes since July to drive increased sales for new sunscreen and hair care products in the health beauty care segment, also boosting sales of detergents and other fabric & home care segment products. We also raise our forecasts for the cosmetics business to reflect growth in mainstay brands and cost efficiency gains stemming from restructuring. In the overseas GC business, we retain our profit forecasts for the Americas, but lower them for the hygiene living care business in Asia to reflect fiercer price competition and a downturn in consumer spending in Indonesia as a result of economic slowing. We also lower our forecasts for Europe to reflect a loss of competitiveness caused in part by slow progress with hair color product revamps.",

In Japan, we expect profit growth to be driven by increased profits at the hygiene living care business as sanitary product margins benefit from changes in the composition of feminine care products, and as the company continues to implement price hikes in the fabric & home care business. We also expect earnings at the health beauty care and cosmetics businesses to benefit from increased sales and cost efficiency gains for core brands, stemming from brand concentration following the completion of portfolio reforms. We expect overseas GC business operating profits to rise \\(19\\%\\) y- y to \\(\\yen 30.0bn\\) . While we expect Kao to continue investing in growth at the health beauty care business in Europe and the Americas, we think it will be able to generate cost efficiency gains via organizational reforms as well as growth in UV and other skincare products, areas where the company has been stepping up efforts. We also expect a global boost of \\(\\yen 6.5bn\\) from lower prices for inputs such as crude oil and palm oil, which should buoy earnings both in Japan and overseas.",

The fair- value P/E we apply is a roughly \\(15\\%\\) premium over the average of about 22x on 26/12 forecasts for the five toiletries companies we cover (Kao, Lion, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, Pigeon, and Unicharm). We forecast an operating profit CAGR of about \\(7\\%\\) through 29/12 (over the end- 26/12 baseline), which is a little higher than the benchmark average of \\(6\\%\\) . We also see good prospects for further shareholder returns now that sustained price hikes and restructuring have boosted the likelihood of medium- term earnings growth, and because improved earnings have enhanced the company's ability to generate operating cash flow.",
