      "text": "Celsius Holdings (CELH, OW- rated, Analyst Focus List) and Pepsico (PEP, N- rated) announced a new agreement this morning that encompasses three key components (details below) for \\(\\) 585M\\(in the form of new preferred shares, increasing PEP ownership from 8.5% to 11.3% on a fully diluted basis (as converted). We attended the initial announcement conference call and also the follow- up call with senior management. Our take on the deal is positive, as it allows CELH to grow its market share in the energy category from \\~17% to \\~20%+ with control over the marketing, shelf space/displays for three brands (now including Rockstar) at a very attractive valuation when accounting for the points of market share acquired (\\~70 to 80% discount to CELH brands). While Rockstar has been underperforming and bleeding market share (more below), it has summed\\)\\\\(250M\\) in sales in the last twelve months (already adjusted for the rationalization of SKUs). CELH is planning to rationalize SKUs and better utilize shelf space with the freedom to move some of the Celsius and Alani Nu products into the existing Rockstar shelf space. Most importantly, from Alani Nu's brand standpoint, PEP's distribution will open more doors in fast growing segments, including foodservice, as well as more penetration in convenience and gas station (C&G) channel, a massive white space for Alani Nu, in our view. The Alani Nu brand resonates with women, who now represent \\(40\\%\\) of the energy market and have been the fastest growing cohort in the industry. To our question on the initial call this morning, management sounded very positive about the most recent trends for Alani Nu, in particular its limited edition launches (LTOs), which is consistent with the sales acceleration we saw in the tracked channel data (link) and our monthly deep dive in the Energy Category (link). Management said that the combined deal will be accretive in its first year, but there will be some customary adjustments for the distribution transition, including inventory reserves and write- offs, especially in Q4.",
