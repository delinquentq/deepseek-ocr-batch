The licensing agreement could result in JCR Pharmaceuticals receiving an upfront payment and post- launch royalties from Medipal Holdings. The impact of these agreements on earnings has already been factored into 26/3 guidance at both JCR Pharmaceuticals and Medipal Holdings.",

We attribute the delay in signing to scrutiny of materials and difficulty reaching agreement about economic conditions, but the company did not provide a clear explanation about specific reasons. As these economic conditions do not include R&D or sales milestone payments, we think Medipal Holdings may have aimed to reduce the volatility of its operating profits. We see little impact on corporate value at JCR Pharmaceuticals in view of the following: (1) It will take several years for the drug to be launched, given that it is a non- clinical pipeline product; (2) there will be no cash inflows until launch (aside from the upfront payment); and (3) the royalty revenues, as estimated from the scale of sales and general royalty rates, are likely to be limited.",

After NHI reimbursement price revisions, pharmaceutical wholesalers tend to negotiate prices with medical institutions. Some companies cut prices in order to gain market share, causing price competition to intensify. Prices are stable at present, but pharmaceutical wholesalers could step up marketing in order to increase their market shares, and medical institutions and dispensing pharmacies could also become more vociferous in their demands for lower prices from pharmaceutical wholesalers. Risk factors that could result in substantial upside versus our target price include a sharp improvement in profitability due to successful initiatives that focus on margins and new businesses getting off the ground rapidly.",

As a rule, JGBs for individual investors may not be sold in the first 12 months after issuance. When JGBs for individual investors are sold before maturity, an amount calculated via the following formula will be subtracted from the par value of the bond plus accrued interest: (1) for 10- year variable rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) x 0.79685 will be used, (2) for 5- year and 3- year fixed rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) x 0.79685 will be used. When inflation- indexed JGBs are purchased via public offerings, secondary distributions (uridashi deals), or other OTC transactions with Nomura Securities, only the purchase price shall be paid, with no sales commission charged. Inflation- indexed JGBs carry the risk of losses, as prices fluctuate in line with changes in market interest rates and fluctuations in the nationwide consumer price index. The notional principal of inflation- indexed JGBs changes in line with the rate of change in nationwide CPI inflation from the time of its issuance. The amount of the coupon payment is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate by the notional principal at the time of payment. The maturity value is the amount of the notional principal when the issue becomes due. For J117 and subsequent issues, the maturity value shall not undercut the face amount. Purchases of investment trusts (and sales of some investment trusts) are subject to a purchase or sales fee of up to 5.5% (tax included) of the transaction amount. Also, a direct cost that may be incurred when selling investment trusts is a fee of up to 2.0% of the unit price at the time of redemption. Indirect costs that may be incurred during the course of holding investment trusts include, for domestic investment trusts, an asset management fee (trust fee) of up to 5.5% (tax included/annualized basis) of the net assets in trust, as well as fees based on investment performance. Other indirect costs may also be incurred. For foreign investment trusts, indirect fees may be incurred during the course of holding such as investment company compensation.",
