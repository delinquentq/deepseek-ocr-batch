The central theme of the meetings was how Zeta can continue to take share of the \\(\\sim\\) 100bn spent in the US on MarTech/AdTech, of which Zeta believes it could address roughly 1/4. Two of the main growth drivers we discussed were the independent agency opportunity and the ability for Zeta to focus more on cross selling different use cases to customers (80% of customers have 1 out of 3 available use cases). Outside of this, investors continue to debate Zeta's valuation discount vs. peers given the financial profile of the company (high revenue and FCF growth). On the question of the growth durability, management noted Zeta's consistent \\(>20\\%\\) growth as a public company through various macro cycles, and their guidance track record demonstrating visibility into the consumption side of the business. Zeta is exploring ways to increase the mix of recurring revenue in the future, potentially through a credits model, while being careful not to disrupt customer buying behavior. We believe that Zeta's ability to drive outsized ROI for customers is helping it outgrow peers via gaining share of both advertising and marketing budgets, particularly as customers look to consolidate tech stacks in order to 1) reduce TCO and 2) enable agents to automate workflows that touch various parts of an organization;",
