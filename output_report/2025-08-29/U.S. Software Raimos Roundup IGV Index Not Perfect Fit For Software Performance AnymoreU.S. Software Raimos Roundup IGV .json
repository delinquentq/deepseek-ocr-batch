Commentary around Al/ML product uptake was constructive and this remains in the early innings, which paired with solid core consumption trends and visibility into 2H migrations should give investors confidence that SNOW's strength can continue in the latter half of the year. It also seems management's previous GTM performance management and refinements are leading to better execution and new logo momentum as well. The top- line outperformance also led to a solid operating margin beat and slight raise despite more S&M investments for future growth. The potential point of debate from the print was the lower than expected FCF in the quarter, but SNOW reiterated its FY guidance and noted good visibility from its schedule of contracted billings and large renewal base in 2H.

      "text": "Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate- friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
