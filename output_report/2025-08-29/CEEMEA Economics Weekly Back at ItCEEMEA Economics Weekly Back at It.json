Their baseline assumed something closer to \\(11\\%\\) in July vs an outcome of \\(8.6\\%\\) . Accordingly, their 2H25 forecast of \\(10.4\\%\\) now looks high compared to what is likely to be something closer to \\(9\\%\\) .

As we wrote in our preview, we thought the MPC had room to cut up to 200bp at this meeting without risking disinflation or foreign portfolio investments. Also, local newspapers had put the broader consensus within a range of a 100 to 200bp cut, with some expectations for even a larger, 300bp, cut.

The central bank elaborated that excluding the impact from the Iran conflict, GDP growth was positive but below the long-term potential growth.- The statement highlighted that geopolitical risks continue to create uncertainty and if they intensify this could translate into supply restrictions continuing to weigh on the recovery of economic activity, and hence growth may be more moderate, and the budget deficit and inflation may be higher.- In terms of inflation data, the July CPI print came out at \\(3.1\\%\\) , down from \\(3.3\\%\\) in June and slightly below our forecast for \\(3.2\\%\\) but in line with consensus expectations. Yet, inflation excluding energy, fruits and vegetables ticked up to \\(3.5\\%\\) from \\(3.4\\%\\) . Similarly, core inflation that also excludes government-initiated price changes ticked up to \\(2.6\\%\\) from \\(2.5\\%\\) in June. Looking ahead, we expect inflation to ease to \\(2.7\\%\\) in September but to move up slightly in 4Q25 to \\(2.9\\%\\) on average and thus to remain uncomfortably close to the upper bound of the tolerance band.- Despite inflation likely to remain close to the upper bound of the tolerance band in 4Q25, we maintain our call for the BOI to deliver one 25bp rate cut in that quarter in anticipation of inflation easing further in 1H26. With the Fed also likely to engage in an easing cycle as soon as September, risks to our forecast are now skewed towards the BOI engaging in an easing cycle also at its September meeting.
