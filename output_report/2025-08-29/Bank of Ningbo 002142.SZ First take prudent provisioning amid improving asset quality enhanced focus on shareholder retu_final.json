With more detailed disclosure, we note 1) BONB maintained prudent provisions of Rmb 4.4bn (+36% yoy/+14% vs. GSe), despite improving asset quality trend evidenced by a decline in NPL formation rate to \\(0.8\\%\\) (-37/-27bps yoy/qqq, -19bps vs. GSe). This lead to a 4ppts sequential increase in the NPL coverage ratio to \\(374\\%\\) , reinforcing risk buffer, which is positive given persistent retail risk (Exhibit 3). 2) Non- Nll growth exceeded expectations, with fee income growth returned to positive (+10% yoy vs. -1% yoy in 1Q25) driven by strong agency sales amid buoyant equity markets, and investment income growth of \\(+15\\% / + 25\\%\\) yoy/qqq, mainly due to favorable bond interest rate movements in 2Q with stable MTM investment portfolio. 3) GS calculated NIM came in at 1.52% (-8/-7bps yoy/qqq, -8bps vs. GSe), below expectations despite limited yoy decline. Nonetheless, Nll growth remained robust at 10% yoy, supported by 15% yoy in IEA growth. 4) CET1 ratio rose by \\(+4 / + 33\\) bps yoy/qqq to \\(9.7\\%\\) , reflecting efficient capital utilization represented by lower RWA density, despite fast loan growth of \\(19\\%\\) yoy. 5) BONB announced its interim dividend plan for the first time, with 1H25 dividend payout ratio of \\(13\\%\\) and DPS of Rmb 0.3, underscoring enhanced focus on shareholder return.",
