As a result, electricity and gas prices fell sharply, significantly increasing their negative contribution to the Aug Tokyo CPI. Also, as a temporary summer measure, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government began waiving basic water charges for all general households in Tokyo in June, for a period of four months. This one- off factor should be noted as it also influenced the CPI. Food prices excl. fresh items rose \\(7.4\\%\\) , marking the third consecutive month of increases above \\(7\\%\\) . Although the rate of rice price increase narrowed by 13.9pt from the previous month, prices still rose \\(67.9\\%\\) YoY, remaining high.",

Given that the nationwide CPI- based weighted median had slowed to \\(1.1\\%\\) in July, whether the nationwide August figure falls below \\(1\\%\\) is likely to draw market attention. That said, in a recent speech by Boj Policy Board Member Junko Nakagawa, it was noted (based on the distribution of item- level CPI price changes) that \"the tails of the distribution have been extended upward, and the simple median has been at around 2 percent,\" potentially suggesting policy implications for the underlying inflation trend.
