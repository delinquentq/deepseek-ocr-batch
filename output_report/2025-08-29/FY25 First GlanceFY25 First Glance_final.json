In terms of risks, on the negative side, BAP may face increased competition from existing competitors (including through downward price pressure), new competitors that enter the industry, vehicle manufacturers, and new technologies or technical advances in vehicles or their parts. In addition, the company called out the risk that new online offerings could negatively impact the company although there is no evidence of this yet. On the positive side, risks include: 1) stronger-than-expected volume and margins in FY25; 2) major M&A; 3) more rapid roll- out of own- brands; and 4) delivery against plan for BTB transformation.",
