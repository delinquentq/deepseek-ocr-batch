      "text": "The July PCE, trade, and inventory reports highlight that consumption and equipment investment are likely on track to exceed our prior 3Q forecasts, though the overall effect on GDP growth is dampened by a July surge in imports. We now expect real GDP growth to be \\(2.5\\%\\) this quarter, up from our prior forecast of \\(1.5\\%\\) . The core PCE inflation data was also right in line with expectations and so shouldn't lead to any revisions to Fed thinking. Solid growth data could reduce fears about downside risks, which at the margin would lean toward keeping rates unchanged, but the FOMC focus will still be next week's release of the August labor data. We continue to expect a 25bps cut at the September meeting, barring any major surprises in the upcoming employment and CPI reports.",

The over- year- ago rate is up from a recent low of \\(2.6\\%\\) in April, though remains within the range it has been in since the start of last year. The failure to make further progress toward the \\(2\\%\\) inflation target was recognized in the July FOMC minutes, though in a speech this week Governor Waller was more sanguine. In particular, he said that excluding tariffs, which he expects will be a one- off price shift, \"underlying inflation continues to run close to the FOMC's 2 percent target.\" That conclusion is based on work by Minton and Somale (2025) to estimate the real- time contribution of tariffs to inflation. The core services ex housing supercore metric meanwhile rose a firm \\(0.4\\% /m\\) , the most since February, and was up \\(3.3\\%\\) oya, with that over- year- ago rate a tick higher than it was in the prior 12- month period.",

If spending were to grow just \\(0.1\\% /m\\) in August and September then 3Q would be up \\(1.7\\% /q\\) saar.

A simple calculation of the change in COMEX warehouse gold inventories times average prices shows a \\(5bn\\) rise, which would be only part of the \\(12bn\\) increase in industrial supply imports. There could also be front- loading of copper imports ahead of the August 1 implementation of the \\(50\\%\\) tariffs.
