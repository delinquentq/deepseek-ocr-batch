A sharp increase in commodity input costs, a continued soft consumer resulting in weaker foodservice momentum, and Planters profit growth lagging expectations made for the \"perfect storm\" to deliver underwhelming 3FQ results, and with most of the pressure continuing into 4FQ, the short- term outlook as well was more muted. With major protein input cost pressure accounting for a \\(\\sim\\) 95mn COGS headwind (based on our calculations), adj. profits were impacted in an outsized manner. While, since peaking in July, we saw some of the input cost issues easing on a sequential basis, compared to 4FQ24 levels costs remain elevated.

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
