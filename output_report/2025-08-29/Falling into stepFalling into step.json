In contrast, the recent leg of UST curve steepening has led to a meaningful flattening of EM spread curves (Figure 1), which have now reverted to their usual negative correlation with the US rates curve. For the Asian credit market specifically, we discussed this in Asia Credit Strategy: Spread curve dislocations, 26 August 2025, but this has been a phenomenon across EM regions, and including EM HY and IG sovereigns (Figure 2). Naturally, such sharp curve moves can provide opportunities for tactical trades to optimise exposure along specific curves that have deviated from the broader trend or where the flattening has been excessive.

      "text": "The dovish winds of Wyoming. After Federal Reserve Chair Powell made dovish comments at the Jackson Hole symposium last week, market participants have turned more optimistic. His remarks suggested the Fed may cut interest rates as early as September, focusing more on the challenges facing the job market than on short- term inflation from tariffs. As a result, our US economics team now expects the Fed to restart its rate cut cycle sooner. They forecast a 25bp cut in September, followed by another 25bp in December. This would bring the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75- 4.00% by the end of 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, the team anticipates two more 25bp cuts, in March and June, which would lower the rate to 3.25- 3.50% by the end of that year (US Outlook: September cut is the baseline, but the door is ajar).",

In the press conference following the release of the policy statement, BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr revealed that the central bank thinks it could be near the end of its easing cycle – but indicated that there is perhaps room for one more 25bp rate cut. Overall, we maintain our base case of another 25bp rate cut in October, though the risk is of a delay if the BSP decides to wait for more data to assess how rice prices are reacting to the government's decision to halt rice imports for 60 days from 1 September. However, even if another 25bp rate cut materializes, this would leave the policy rate at a still relatively high \\(4.75\\%\\) – which implies the risk of further normalization via even more rate cuts if CPI inflation does turn out to be more benign than the BSP expects.",

The KAZAKS curve is a case in point. While spreads of the KAZAKS 2032s and 2037s have not moved much since the bonds were issued in late June, those at the long end of the curve (KAZAKS 2044s/2045s) have tightened considerably (Figure 1). This has left the curve very flat, with the 2032s and 2037s screening as cheap. And while Kazakhstan's fundamental trajectory remains on solid footing, as evidenced by S&P's decision to revise the country's BBB- rating outlook to positive last weekend, we think that spreads at the long end provide little buffer against potential further volatility in rates.

Aside from agriculture, the slowdown would be partly explained by adverse financial conditions due to the BCB's latest monetary tightening, higher risk premia caused by fiscal uncertainty and a more-challenging global environment. While we see some downside risks to the Q2 25 print due to a 5% y/y decline in business days in that quarter versus a year earlier (61 versus 64), some offset could come from the release of BRL12bn from a workers' severance fund (FGTS) to up to 12mn workers between March and June. We maintain our annual GDP growth forecast for 2025 at 2.1% (from 3.4% in 2024), considering the support from a tight labor market, rising incomes and various government initiatives that should provide some cushion for domestic demand in H2 despite the ongoing slowdown in credit markets. Among those, we cite the recent launch of revamped, payroll-backed credit lines, the July payment of some BRL63bn (c.0.5% of GDP) in precatories, and a beefed-up housing program (\"Minha Casa, Minha Vida\").",

The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist.
