As one of the leading AI PCB/IC substrate suppliers in China, we think SC is a key beneficiary of China's AI chip development, led by its long-term partnership with top AI/tech customers, i.e., Huawei (unlisted) and Cambricon (688256 CH, Not rated). Meanwhile, SC is making solid progress in the global AI PCB market, as overseas market growth accelerated to \\(47\\%\\) y-y (vs \\(29\\%\\) y-y in FY24) and contributed \\(37\\%\\) of total revenue in 1H25. In view of the robust demand for AIPCB and IC substrate (primarily for China customers), we raise FY25- 27F revenue and earnings forecasts by \\(3.5 - 12\\%\\) and \\(13.2 - 29.3\\%\\) , respectively. We maintain our Buy rating and raise TP to CNY220, based on 42x (previously 27x) FY26F EPS of CNY5.19, in line with the China PCB sector's FY25 median P/E but higher than the FY26F median (32x), as we think the company's IC substrate business exposure to domestic AI chip leaders justifies the valuation premium. The stock is trading at 36x FY26F EPS.",

The company strives to increase capacity through technical upgrades on its existing factories and expanding new production lines in Thailand (starting trial production in 3Q25), Nantong IV (starting trial production in 4Q25). We think its capacity constraints should ease in 2026F, leading to further upside for the PCB segment.
