Georgina Fraser notes that investors saw the share price move as surprising, given: 1) the market typically values a beat and raise on OSG more highly, and 2) there is upside to consensus adj. EPS implied by the 1H25 run rate. That said, with growth decelerating in 2H (as a result of exiting Russia operations), many investors also see a lack of near- term catalysts for the stock. Georgina adjusts her numbers post results and now expects FY25 OSG of \\(7.3\\%\\) (from \\(8.0\\%\\) ) driven by the company's guidance and lower growth expected for the Food and Beverages and Household Care segments. Post these changes, she is still \\(5 - 10\\%\\) above consensus for adj. EPS for 2025/26/27 and continues to expect Novonesis to deliver the highest OSG in her coverage due to its innovation and penetration driven business model underpinned by robust underlying demand trends and supportive policy drivers, and argues that delivering MSD organic growth (HSD excl. Russia exit) at 3Q will stand out notably vs. ingredients peers where she expects LSD at best and could lead to a divergence in performance. Buy rated (on Conviction List) with c. \\(+30\\%\\) upside, trading at \\(2.1\\times \\mathsf{PE}\\mathsf{V}\\) s. an average of \\(4.4x\\) for the other ingredient names.",
