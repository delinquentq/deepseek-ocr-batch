FCF of R2.96bn surprised to the upside (BofAe: R2.4bn; cons R2.7bn), underscoring TRU's prolific cash generation even after adjusting for late settlement of trade payables. Revenue growth in H2 improved to +4.2% y/y vs +2.5% in H1. However, a marked deterioration in trading profit (margin -190bps y/y) is noteworthy. Moreover, sales cadence post year-end is tracking significantly weaker than expected, with group turnover -0.1%y/y vs our (prior) FY26E forecast of +4.4% and consensus at +5.0%.",

Absent higher GDP growth, we are concerned that TRU will suffer ongoing margin erosion LT as opex growth outpaces top line. That said, strong cash generation (FCF to sales &gt;10%) and a net cash position (cr700m) provide a valuation underpin and our EPS outlook is broadly stable mid-term at -R7.0/sh.
