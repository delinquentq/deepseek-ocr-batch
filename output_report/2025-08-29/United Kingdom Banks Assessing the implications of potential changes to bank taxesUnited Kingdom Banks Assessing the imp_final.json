Currently, UK banks pay a \\(3\\%\\) banking surcharge on top of the \\(25\\%\\) corporation tax rate, for a combined rate of \\(28\\%\\) . Additionally, UK banks pay a bank levy, which represents an annual charge on certain balance sheet liabilities and equity.",

      "text": "Moreover, we note that the Institute for Public Policy Research today (29 August) published a report which outlined two potential measures for fiscal savings: i) implementing a levy on commercial banks relating to the reserves resulting from quantitative easing, and ii) slowing the pace of quantitative tightening by the Bank of England. Regarding the former measure, the IPPR estimates this could save £35- 40bn between now and 2029/30. To arrive at this estimate, the IPPR looked at the level of outstanding gilts in the Bank of England's Asset Purchase Facility, valued at purchase value — per our understanding, the value of these gilts (starting from over c.£500bn and winding down to c.£200bn by 2029- 2030) was then multiplied by the gap between the assumed BoE base rate and a \\(2.0\\%\\) floor, resulting in £10bn baseline levy revenue in 2025/26 and £7.5bn in 2026/27, with £32bn cumulatively through to 2029/30, with the forecast varying depending on the level of quantitative tightening). While this is not clear to us exactly how this theoretical levy would be implemented of a bank by bank basis, one potential option the IPPR notes would be referencing banks' total sterling assets, or their 'first tier' of reserves. If such a policy measure were adopted, this could in our view be notably more consequential to bank profitability than a modest increase to the banking surcharge.",
