Quarterly revenue increased \\(10.4\\%\\) y- y to CNY77bn (1H24 revenue growth of \\(10.2\\%\\) y- y), while quarterly earnings increased \\(16.0\\%\\) y- y to CNY6.5bn (1H25 earnings growth of \\(15.6\\%\\) y- y). Thanks to Haier's continued efforts to reduce costs/improve efficiency in the domestic market, along with its premium product positioning/integration of supply chain in the overseas markets, the company delivered a 1H25 gross margin of \\(26.9\\%\\) (up 0.1pp y- y). Haier has further optimized its operations through digitalization, leading to a 0.1pp y- y improvement in its sales- cost ratio in 1H25 to \\(10.1\\%\\) . Furthermore, Haier announced an interim DPS of CNY0.269, the first interim dividend of the company, indicating its strong commitment to shareholder returns, in our view. Haier's current FY25F dividend yield stands at a decent level of \\(4.7\\%\\) . Haier, in our view, will maintain its solid sales/earnings growth in 2H25F despite headwinds from a fading impact of trade- in programs. We forecast the company's sales/earnings to increase by \\(8\\% /13\\%\\) y- y in FY25F. We maintain our Buy rating.",

For the overseas market, despite the sector- wide weakness in the US/European markets (1H25 home appliances sales value was slightly up by \\(0.5\\% /0.4\\%\\) y- y), Haier has been able to gain market shares in these markets (sales up \\(2.4\\% /8.5\\%\\) y- y); it recorded even- faster growth in emerging markets (1H25 sales in South Asia/ASEAN/Middle East up by \\(33\\% /18\\% /65\\%\\) y- y), leveraging its multi- brand and premiumization strategies.",
