We obtain our target price of ¥18,300 by applying a P/E of 19.4x to our EPS forecast of ¥948.3 for 27/3 (rolled forward from 26/3), and reiterate our Buy rating. As before, we apply a 10% premium to the average P/E for the Russell/Nomura Large Cap Index (ex financials) to reflect the company's medium- term profit growth potential.",
