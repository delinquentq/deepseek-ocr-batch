While the energy transition remains an overarching theme, history has shown that renewable energy build- out at scale does not necessarily translate into returns at all points of the value chain. Industry cycles, technological advancement, and geopolitics all come into play. In this report, we give10 answers to questions relating to the transition on three main topics: 1) Which transition value chains are in supply tightness or emerging as important ones? 2) Where are geopolitical risks less well understood? 3) Which transition technologies will be the next game changers? JPM- covered stocks that emerge as our top picks include: Bannerman Energy (BMN), CATL- A, Hyundai Electric, Hyosung Heavy, ILU, LG Chem, LG Energy Solution, Orient Cables, Sieyuan and Tenaga.",

Overall, we welcome the company's initiatives, though our reservations lie in rising competition, in particular in the mid- to high- end BEV SUVs that are Li's focus (i8 and coming i6 in Sept).

The Indian government has already approved 10 semiconductor plants so far with cumulative investments of Rs1600bn of which one plant is of Kaynes where it will be investing Rs33bn. We will watch out for: 1) any potential announcement by the government around expanding the Rs760bn initial outlay given increased interest from companies in setting up semiconductor plants, and 2) any potential announcement by Kaynes on either offtake agreements or technology partnership on OSAT.",

While this would normally be considered a significant headwind, the global policy easing and China liquidity surge currently underway is providing a strong counter force. In this context, we believe the equity bull market will remain intact and any correction/consolidation will present a buying opportunity. However, it is important to manage risks where positioning is particularly crowded. Looking across LO, HF and Quant investors, we note the highest crowding in Taiwan Tech/Semis and Indo Financials, followed by China Growth stocks (semis, consumer and biotech). Alongside this, ongoing support from monetary policy should eventually warrant a widening of the leadership and outperformance of Cyclicals. We are upgrading the Materials sector to Ow in the AxJ region following our recent allocation changes in India (see report). Within the AxJ region, our pecking order is Korea \\(>\\) India \\(>\\) China \\(>\\) Taiwan \\(>\\) ASEAN. Our key OwS are: China Tech, Internet, Healthcare, Materials, select Financial/Industrials; India Financials, Consumer ex Auto, Materials, Real Estate, Hospitals, select power/defense; Korea Financials, Tech, Holdco; TSMC in Taiwan; and ASEAN Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Healthcare, IT.",

This should benefit leading players including ZS. Our channel checks suggest Benz and BMW have closed \\(\\sim 4\\%\\) of their stores in China in recent months. 2) Benz, which accounted for \\(35\\%\\) of ZS' new car sales revenue in 1H25, is entering into a powerful product cycle in 2026- 27 with 31 new or facelifted models across the BEV and ICE portfolio. We hence expect narrowing price discounts for Benz (currently c. \\(15 - 20\\%\\) ) and potentially other premium brands in the next two years; 3) Overseas expansion for selected mainland Chinese brands likely starting in Hong Kong, Macau or neighboring markets given much higher GPM (generally \\(8 - 10\\%\\) ) in overseas markets vs. domestic \\((- 2 - 4\\%)\\) ; we would welcome this move if it materializes. 4) Anticipated further rebate from OEMs in 2H25: OEMs' rebate or compensation collectively translated into \\(>Rmb15k\\) per car in 2024 but was fairly limited in 1H25, hence we believe OEMs will offer rebates to quality dealers such as ZS in 2H25 rather than to smaller dealers that may be subject to closure.",
