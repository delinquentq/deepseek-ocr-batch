In particular, we continue to see risks of higher US term premia and higher real yields, given the unpredictable and unconventional policy landscape under Trump. We also see risk that US inflation fears could rise, due to both Trump's threats to Fed independence and tariff- related impacts still to flow through to US CPI inflation over coming months. Global investors and reserve managers are heavily exposed to the US government bonds, and we do see risk that flows could tilt away from that market. Our team's tracking of such flows certainly does not suggest that global investors are abandoning that market, but inflows have become less consistent.",

On the flow side, Australian BOP data (albeit dated) show strong global buying of AUD bonds, and more recent Japan BOP data show that interest from Japan has rebounded over more recent months.

However, our sense is that investors may be more likely to add to, or initiate this position at current levels, rather than stop out. The 5y5y cross market spread (Fig. 2) is another popular expression of these themes, and often appears to trade within a range, being \"policed\" by investors, who frequently seem to fade extremes, anticipating mean reversion. At current levels, we think that investors are more likely to initiate or add to such trades, rather than stop out.",

In contrast, the Australian strip appears to be pricing a tightening cycle, commencing from late 2026, which we do not expect.
