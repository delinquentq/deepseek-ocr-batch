Mass Market (B2C+SOHO) Fixed service revenue growth of \\(16.2\\%\\) , was supported by volumes and a \\(1.5\\%\\) increase in reported ARPU on better speed and access mix. The company is successfully upselling to its growing base and the initiation of 2- year contracts last year reduces the need for promotional activity, expecting price increases in- line with CPI will continue. Net adds slowed sequentially to \\(+9k\\) as access providers approach targeted footprints (supported by earlier gains (Q1 +24k; Q4 +50k). Odido continues to see significant opportunities for growth in the recently opened markets. Mass Market Mobile growth was driven by robust net adds (+29k) offsetting slight ARPU declines (- 0.4% y/y) due to lower out of bundle revenues, higher promotional activity and brand- mix composition effects. Enterprise segment (10% of total revenue) was broadly stable, growing \\(0.4\\%\\) , driven by \\(4.1\\%\\) growth fixed revenues offset by declines in mobile (- 1.6%) and equipment (- 16.7%) revenues. Adj. EBITDAaL rose \\(7.2\\%\\) to €198m (JPMc €198m), with margins up \\(+91\\) bps benefitting from top- line growth and cost efficiencies. With the Mobile RAN swap now largely complete, capex savings impressed, coming in at €72m (JPMc €82m), down \\(57.5\\%\\) y/y. However, cash capex only decreased by \\(11.7\\%\\) , due to the rollover of invoices.",

The company offered no incremental financial policy commitments; however, management previously said it was likely to continue to deliver in the near term as it awaits a strategic decision. On the call, management said ongoing strategic assessment is unchanged, reiterating that a public listing remains a possible option. The company noted it is conducting a \"bit of roadshow\", which may evolve into more proactive communication later this year. On the FY24 call, management acknowledged that leverage would need to come down to make the capital structure more palatable for public markets, and confirming the likelihood of primary shares.",

We believe the operator is well- positioned to capitalize on the transition from legacy cable (HFC) and copper (DSL) to fibre (FTTH) in the Dutch market, as it advances its fibre rollout across access providers while maintaining a successful commercial strategy. On the call, management saw few changes in competitive dynamics, with KPN's base retention efforts now fully digested and reflected in the numbers. Odido was confident in its product offering and pricing, noting ongoing base management and retention activities, notably from KPN and to a lesser extent from VodafoneZiggo. We note that as part of VodafoneZiggo's strategic plan, the operator reduced frontbook pricing (by €3- 4/pm) to align closer to peers and reinvest in loyalty programs, FMC and in- home WiFi. So far, Odido has not seen the need to react with similar price moves. Odido said the mobile market is healthy if campaign driven, seeing no major shift in dynamics compared to last year. Intense competition persists at the lower end (MVNO budget brands), yet it hasn't encroached upon the premium segment. Odido recently launched FWA, offering a 5G based broadband solution in some areas without fibre. While the company didn't formally disclose figures ( \\(\\sim 20k\\) subscribers at FY24), it noted the service is a strong contributor to total growth.",

The company has delivered solid operating growth since the buyout by financial sponsors in 2022, with the rebranded company continuing mobile growth and now taking share in the Dutch broadband market (necessitating price reductions from VodafoneZiggo). Odido has now largely completed the major RAN swap (from Huawei to Ericsson); management says they expect to rapidly deliver on FCF generation, driven by significantly lower investments and continued EBITDA growth. The potential listing commentary has been incremental, with management only indirectly addressing IPO reports (see here), highlighting the expected fixed line growth, near- term FCF inflection following the Huawei equipment swap out and the completion of the rebrand (to Odido); 2025 would be the first year that \"Odido and IPO make sense in the same sentence\". In our view, spreads appear attractive on the Senior Notes (TM0BNL \\(5.5\\%\\) 2030 senior notes, 100.777, \\(z + 286bp\\) , mid 29 August 2025, COB). Downside risks to our rating include: i) weaker than expected operating performance, potentially impacted by VodafoneZiggo price cuts, driving weaker credit metrics; and ii) sponsors undertake a recapitalization, rather than deleveraging and listing, increasing leverage.",

Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform",
