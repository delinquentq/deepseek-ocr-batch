The \\(3.5\\%\\) increase in Q2 also matched our expectations, although with slightly different details. Consumption was stronger, with goods spending partly reflecting some front- loading of purchases such as cars. But services spending was also much stronger than expected, possibly as some services demand shifted back domestically as travel to the US fell. Further upside from this dynamic however may be more limited in coming quarters. Government spending was also stronger in Q2.",
