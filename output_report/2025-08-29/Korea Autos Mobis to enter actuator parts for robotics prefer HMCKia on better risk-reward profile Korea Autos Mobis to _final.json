A detailed roadmap was not disclosed, but Mobis emphasized how they see similarities in actuators for automobiles and robotics, as a rationale to enter the business. Mobis has shown notable strength in its share price since the announcement, \\(+5.3\\%\\) at today's close versus Hyundai Motor \\(0.0\\%\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Kia} + 2.2\\%\\) (KOSPI: \\(0.0\\%\\) ). In the past, there have been instances where Mobis has seen near- term share price strength associated with investor focus on potential restructuring and recently on momentum related to Boston Dynamics (Exhibit 1). Mobis' recent price action may be driven more by the latter given its August 27 announcement.",
