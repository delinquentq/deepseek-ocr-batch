The print leads us to reduce our earnings forecasts by \\(0 - 1\\%\\) in FY25- 27E, as we are not clear about: 1) its overseas sales growth in 2H25, which only rose \\(\\sim 5\\%\\) YoY in 1H25, below our expectations of double- digit growth; and 2) how high domestic sales growth can reach in 2H25. Hence, we assume FY25E sales will decline \\(0.4\\%\\) YoY. Near- term pressure aside, we remain positive about Mindray's medium- to long- term outlook, with an inflection point in sight, allowing us to chart mid- teens to low- teens sales growth in the longer term. Valuation is not demanding either, trading at \\(21x / 25x\\) based on consensus/JPMc 2026E earnings. Compared to consensus, our FY25/26/27E sales and net profit estimates are \\(4\\% /7\\% /6\\%\\) and \\(8\\% /4\\% /1\\%\\) below, respectively. In our model, we extend our PT end date to Dec- 2026.
