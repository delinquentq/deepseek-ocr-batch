We think an outsized share of mega- projects and an increasing shift toward rental vs owned equipment should see continued market share gains. Additionally, increased exposure to non- construction/specialty/MRO provides increasing protection from a cyclical downturn. While near- term growth is likely to be held back by ongoing uncertainty in US construction markets alongside high interest rates, we believe we are past the trough of the downgrade cycle and consensus looks well calibrated from here. Ashtead's Sunbelt 4.0 roadmap to 2029 targets a 5- year organic rental revenue CAGR of \\(6 - 9\\%\\) for the US/Group, with volume growth from greenfields and same- store alongside rate progression driving a \\~10% EPS CAGR to 2029.",
