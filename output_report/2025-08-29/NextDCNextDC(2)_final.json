This allows NextDC not only to attract customers that require best-in-class data center facilities, but also to operate with a lower fixed-cost base than competitors.- Continued exponential growth in data and cloud computing remains a secular tailwind for data centers.- While NextDC has been able to ride the remarkable 20%+ CAGR of cloud computing, IT outsourcing and data usage growth over the last five years, we do not expect exponential growth to slow anytime soon. Cisco estimates high-teens growth in cloud computing globally, while Internet traffic and data usage continue to grow at 20%+ annually.- We estimate a mid-to-high-teens IRR on second-generation data centers.- NextDC has achieved a low- to mid-20% IRR on its first-generation data centers in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. With capacity selling out within five to seven years and continued growth in Interconnectivity revenues, the company has proven its expertise in building out top-tier data centers and is able to attract a strong ecosystem of telecom vendors and partners. We estimate that the second-generation data centers will achieve mid- to high-teens returns despite being many times larger. These are favourable returns compared to its WACC of 9.4%.- Global expansion by large data center operators could drive industry M&A.- As the recent acquisitions of Metronode by Equinix, Ascenty by Digital Realty, Zenium by CyrusOne and CyrusOne’s strategic partnership with GDS Holdings show, US-based data center operators are looking to expand internationally in order to meet customer demand. With long lead times for construction and difficulty securing prime real estate in metros, it makes more sense for these operators to acquire data centers than to build them themselves, in our view. This is particularly true if the data centers are recently built and are up to the highest standards, like those of NextDC.",
