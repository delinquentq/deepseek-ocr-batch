For Sema STEP-2, patients has weekly injection with titration over 16w to a target dose of 2.4mg, however for ACHIEVE-1 patients started at 1mg and increased incrementally to their target dose (12mg, 24mg, 36mg) over 12 weeks. Despite faster titration for Orfo, vomiting rates weren't higher than Sema, so until we see the full data for ATTAIN-1 (exp at EASD'25) & ATTAIN-2, we're taking this as data supporting that oral Orfo has a similar vomiting profile to injectable sema.",

Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a \\(15\\%\\) stop loss, and the remainder will have a \\(20\\%\\) stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.",
