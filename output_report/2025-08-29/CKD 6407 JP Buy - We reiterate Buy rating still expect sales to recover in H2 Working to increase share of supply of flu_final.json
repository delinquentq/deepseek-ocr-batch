We nudge up our operating profit forecasts to reflect the weak yen and COGS ratio improvements. We still expect sales of fluid control equipment to stagnate in H1, but think that overseas orders will remain strong thanks to solid generative AI- related investment and market share gains in China and the US. We still expect sales of pneumatic equipment to recover in H2, supported by increased sales of solutions thanks to the shift to unit- based systems. CKD said that its initial outlook remained pretty unchanged even though its main customer had lowered its 26/3 sales guidance. Moreover, the COGS ratio has been improving thanks to cost savings implemented since 25/3, and we also expect tighter controls on personnel costs associated with reorganization of production in Japan through end- 26/3. We raise our target price to ¥3,200, which we still obtain by multiplying our 26/3 EPS forecast by a P/E of around 16x.",

The company has been consistently taking market share from Japanese rivals, but Western rivals are also finding it hard to enter the Chinese market (European and North American companies have had restrictions imposed on sales to Chinese companies, and Chinese companies in turn have been avoiding US parts). CKD has also been increasing its share of supply to a US SPE producer as it has switched to new equipment that features its parts. We expect increased output at this customer's Southeast Asian plants to contribute to earnings in Q4.",

As a rule, JGBs for individual investors may not be sold in the first 12 months after issuance. When JGBs for individual investors are sold before maturity, an amount calculated via the following formula will be subtracted from the par value of the bond plus accrued interest: (1) for 10- year variable rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) \\(x 0.79685\\) will be used, (2) for 5- year and 3- year fixed rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) \\(x 0.79685\\) will be used. When inflation- indexed JGBs are purchased via public offerings, secondary distributions (uridashi deals), or other OTC transactions with Nomura Securities, only the purchase price shall be paid, with no sales commission charged. Inflation- indexed JGBs carry the risk of losses, as prices fluctuate in line with changes in market interest rates and fluctuations in the national economic price index. The notional principal of inflation- indexed JGBs changes in line with the rate of change in national CPI inflation from the time of its issuance. The amount of the coupon payment is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate by the notional principal at the time of payment. The maturity value is the amount of the notional principal when the issue becomes due. For J117 and subsequent issues, the maturity value shall not undercut the face amount. Purchases of investment trusts (and sales of some investment trusts) are subject to a purchase or sales fee of up to \\(5.5\\%\\) (tax included) of the transaction amount. Also, a direct cost that may be incurred when selling investment trusts is a fee of up to \\(2.0\\%\\) of the unit price at the time of redemption. Indirect costs that may be incurred during the course of holding investment trusts include, for domestic investment trusts, an asset management fee (trust fee) of up to \\(5.5\\%\\) (tax included/annualized basis) of the net assets in trust, as well as fees based on investment performance. Other indirect costs may also be incurred. For foreign investment trusts, indirect fees may be incurred during the course of holding such as investment company compensation.",
