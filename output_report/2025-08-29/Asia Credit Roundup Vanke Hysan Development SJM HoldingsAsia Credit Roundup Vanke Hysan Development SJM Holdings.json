We agree with this view, and we believe SZM has expressed its commitment to support by providing eight shareholder loans totaling Rmb24bn to Vanke YTD to help the developer with offshore/onshore debt repayment. Vanke still has Rmb12bn of maturities for the remainder of 2025, and a separate Rmb12bn of maturities in 2026, and we believe SZM will extend the liquidity support into the next year. We stay OW on VNKRLE '27s (82.4 offer, \\(13.6\\%\\) ytm) and '29s (74.4 offer, \\(11.3\\%\\) ytm). If the Reorg- reported Vanke consolidation into SZM successfully proceeds, we believe it can drive the curve to compress to high- single- digit yields, similar to other SOEs.

With its high- quality shopping malls that account for half of its revenue, we think the company is well- positioned to benefit from an expected recovery in the Hong Kong retail property sector. Indeed, its earnings are already showing signs of recovery, and this should continue. Such recovery and the recently announced capital recycling plan should help its credit metrics to improve gradually, before accelerating into 2027 with maiden contributions from Lee Gardens Eight. We move to OW on Hysan and are OW along the curve ('27s, '29s & '35s) and its perpetual bonds ( \\(7.2\\%\\) 'c30s and \\(4.85\\%\\) fixed- for- life).

EBITDA margin deteriorated to \\(9.6\\%\\) from \\(12.8\\%\\) in 1Q25. The main drag came from unfavorable VIP luck (- HK\\$114mn) and higher- than- expected OPEX, especially in its flagship GLP (HK\\$8.6m/day, \\(+5\\%\\) q/q and \\(+23\\%\\) y/y). Even adjusted for luck, EBITDA came at HK\\$802mn (- \\(17\\%\\) qoq), still \\(13\\%\\) below consensus and contrary to other Macau peers, which had EBITDA growth of \\(6\\%\\) qoq on average in 2Q. SJM lost the most market share in the Macau gaming sector in Q2, dropping 120bps to \\(12.3\\%\\) , due mainly to a 100bps decline in mass/slot share to \\(13.4\\%\\) . On the balance sheet side, net debt edged up HK\\$0.4bn qoq to HK\\$23.9bn, with a nearly 7x net leverage ratio (based on TTM EBITDA), the highest net leverage ratio among peers.",

      "text": "The results are weak in our view. Given its smaller earnings base and the weaker starting point for its balance sheet, the company's de- leveraging process has been slower than its peers. More worrisome is that the 2Q25 results show the company could be in reverse gear, and things could get worse. The absorption of 440 tables could add thousands of staff from the satellite casinos that will be closed, which could weigh on earnings if the additional tables do not translate into additional market share. At the same time, payments for the two satellite casinos could further weigh on its balance sheet. We have a UW recommendation on SJM and its bonds as valuations look tight at current levels. While we remain positive on the Macau gaming sector, we would prefer Melco '32s (104.2 offer, \\(6.33\\%\\) ytw, \\(z + 300\\) ), which is our top pick in the sector. With HY bonds trading near IG bonds at the back end, we also see opportunities in Sands China '29s (93.8 offer, \\(4.82\\%\\) ytw, \\(z + 150\\) ). Please see our sector report for the risks to our recommendations and the potential catalysts. (SC/Shirley)",

      "text": "J.P. Morgan uses a bond- level rating system that incorporates valuations (relative value) and our fundamental view on the security. Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).",
