We expect real activity to have expanded by \\(0.35\\%\\) qoq sa (below- trend) during 2Q25, moderating from the strong above- trend \\(1.4\\%\\) qoq sa Q1 reading. The forecasted deceleration of activity during 2Q25 is expected to have been driven on the supply side, by the contraction of agriculture & livestock (following the large \\(+12.2\\%\\) qoq sa Q1 print) which is expected to have been only partially offset by firmer industrial activity (levered by mining since manufacturing and construction are forecasted to have been soft). Services activity is expected to have recorded another modest increase. On the demand side, we anticipate a positive but light expansion of household consumption during Q2 and a decline in gross fixed capital formation (from \\(+3.1\\%\\) qoq sa in Q1). Government consumption is expected to have recorded a small sequential increase, and the contribution of net- exports to growth to switch from a drag in Q1 to positive in Q2 driven by rising exports and declining imports.",
