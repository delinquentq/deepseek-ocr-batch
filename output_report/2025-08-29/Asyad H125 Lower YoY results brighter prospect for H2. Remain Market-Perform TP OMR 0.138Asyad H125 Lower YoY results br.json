The challenging market conditions—particularly in the Product, Bulk, and Gas segments, with broader macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds—contributed to these results. The company's net debt to EBITDA ratio increased from 1.4x to 1.8x (reported). The fleet expanded from 86 to 94 vessels (including owned, leased, and committed) from end of 2024.",

The company expects robust Crude activity driven by increased OPEC production and rising Chinese demand, as well as a favorable demand/ supply mismatch that is pushing up rates. While the Product segment is anticipated to further soften, Dry Bulk is showing signs of recovery following a softer H1. The Gas segment faces challenges due to an increasing number of new vessels in the global fleet, which may continue to exert downward pressure on rates. The Liner segment, despite showing strength in H1, is seeing persistently softening container rates. Asyad with approximately 85-90% of its revenues secured through contracts, has a robust backlog worth $1.7bn in contracted revenues—the remaining revenue being spot-priced. Consistent with its dividend policy, the company has a dividend of BZS 5.56 per share for H1'25, scheduled for payment in September, translating to an annualized dividend yield of c.9%.",
