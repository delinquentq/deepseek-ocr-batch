The company also accelerated development of AI- powered specialty disciplines, including oncology MDT and expanded centers such as chest pain and stroke units. Cost efficiency initiatives continued, with total headcount reduced from 8,169 to 8,017, including a 5.6% cut in administrative and management staff.

Operating cash flow improved 29.9% y/y to Rmb455.7mn, supported by better working capital management—trade receivables declined 23.1% y/y, trade payable fell 16.9% y/y, and gearing ratio dropped 8.4% y/y to 29.2%.
