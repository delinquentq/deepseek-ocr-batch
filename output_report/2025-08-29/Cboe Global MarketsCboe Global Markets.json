CBOE had successfully grown its SPX franchise with the support of 0DTE contracts, but we think this catalyst has seasoned, as we now observe a stabilizing and in some places shrinking of the SPX franchise. Likewise, we see the VIX franchise decelerating as well. Finally, we think CBOE benefitted from peak earnings in 2024 given the elevated equity market volatility and greater participation of retail investors; as such, we see downside risk here and higher comps for 2025 results. Finally, we think the observed market share loss in multi- listed options will persist as new entrants erode Cboe's pricing power. With perhaps lower volatility, higher comps, and pricing pressure from new entrants, we think there are better places to put money to work in our exchange sub- sector. Underscoring this point is Cboe's valuation, which we view as being overly generous; we view Cboe being largely overvalued beyond \\(20x\\) with a price target of \\(\\) 216\\$",
