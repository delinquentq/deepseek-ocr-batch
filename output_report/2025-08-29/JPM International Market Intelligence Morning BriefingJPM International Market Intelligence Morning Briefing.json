The SPX delivered a new ATH but the equal- weight version of the index was essentially unchanged. A solid 2Q GDP revision did not really help the broadening trade but today's PCE could be different. Brazil was also in the spotlight yesterday, with equities notably outperforming the US and global peers. This comes as the presidential elections near into focus, with moves driven by a poll release – which revealed that President Lula's popularity wavered in August, and that the tariff- driven spike in approval ratings was short lived.",

Overall, fiscal outcomes are expected to remain in line with forecasts, even in a relative majority RN government. The main risks to this are if Macron resigns (but probability very low at 5%) or if a Left coalition forms. Taken together, the recent repricing in French spreads seems broadly fair. On FX, the transmission of political risk should be limited given bounded fiscal outcomes. While the team remains bullish EUR/USD, fair value has now converged to market levels, so EUR/CHF could be a better expression if spreads continue to widen.- The topic of the internal rotation. As we noted yesterday, Luxury is probably the most debated theme as investors focus on: a) the dislocations to China rally (but with reservations, given driver of A shares has been liquidity, not macro surprises); b) increasing confidence on the strength of US consumer (visible in high frequency proxies and with tailwinds from Stock/Crypto wealth effects); and c) positioning. That said, some question the sustainability of the move as it happens amid some momentum unwind. Our Asia Consumer Spec sales notes the next catalyst could come from EU Luxury companies updating investors on latest news/thoughts in September.",
