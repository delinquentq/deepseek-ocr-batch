The Transpacific routes are the biggest driver of the bump in the index, with the Shanghai- USWC route rising to \\(\\) 1,923\\(/\\) \\mathrm {f}\\$ eu from \\(\\) 1,644\\(/\\) \\mathrm {f}\\$ eu last week and Shanghai- USEC rising to \\(\\) 2,866\\(/\\) \\mathrm {f}\\$ eu from \\(\\) 2,613/\\(f\\) eu. These gains appear driven by a mix of September GRI pricing and a slight shift in capacity away from the Transpacific and onto the Europe and Transatlantic routes. While the Transpacific has seen an improvement, the Shanghai- Europe route has fallen week- over- week and is assessed at \\(\\) 1,481\\(/\\) \\mathrm {f}\\$ eu compared to \\(\\) 1,668/\\(f\\) eu.",
