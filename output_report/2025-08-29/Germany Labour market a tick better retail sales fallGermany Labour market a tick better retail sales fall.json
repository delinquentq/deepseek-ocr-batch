The number of unemployed fell 9,000, the first monthly decline since the end of 2022. Employment also ticked back up (+4,000) in July, after two consecutive declines. Vacancies are still moving lower, but short-time work subsidy applications have slowed somewhat and actual usage of the scheme (on a full-time equivalent basis) has also declined. In addition, the business surveys (PMI, IFO) and IAB barometer are pointing to a modest improvement in the labour market from recent months. The changes are modest, but the direction is constructive.",
