For the next week, we expect prices to remain stable as rising exports are balanced by weaker soybean oil prices. Overall, we expect the average CPO price to remain at MYR4,375/MT until 4 September. However, if exports from Malaysia rise sharply or if production concerns rise, CPO prices could increase to MYR4,450/MT.",
