      "text": "For gold and silver companies, in particular, long- term commodity prices matter because they are important drivers of discounted cash flow (DCF) / net asset value (NAV) valuations. Precious metal companies often (but not always) tend to own assets with shorter mine lives and thus investment analysis tends to apply a DCF rather than an earnings multiple as a starting point on valuation. We think that mining companies also use some assumption of long- term prices when considering capital allocation, both organic and inorganic, as well as when estimating reserves and resources. The price used by mining companies to estimate reserves is often a trailing average of around three years. At year- end 2024, this trailing 3- year average was around \\(\\) 2,050/oz\\(. By year- end 2025, our forecasts suggest this should increase to around\\) \\ \\(2,500 / oz\\)",
