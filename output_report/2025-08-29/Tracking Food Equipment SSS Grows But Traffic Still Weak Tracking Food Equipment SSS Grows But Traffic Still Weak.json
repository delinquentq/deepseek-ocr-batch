In addition, we expect to close 12 to 17 company-owned restaurants in 2026. Turning to the rest of our full year guidance for 2025, we’re revising our expectations based on recent trends.WENFirst is net unit growth. We have opened 118 new restaurants in the first half of the year, and we remain on track to deliver between 2% to 3% net new unit growth for the full year.TKHRDuring the second quarter, we opened four company-owned restaurants, including two Bubba&#x27;s 33 locations, and we remain on track to open approximately 30 company-owned restaurants this year.MCDFinally, we remain on pace to open approximately 2,200 restaurants globally this year and continue to target about 1/4 of these openings to be in our U.S. and IOM segment. We expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IOM markets, including about 1,000 in China. In total, we continue to expect slightly over 4% unit growth from the nearly 1,800 net restaurant additions in 2025.YUMMoving towards a significant event. We opened 871 gross new units in the quarter, largely consistent with Q2 of last year and translating to 386 net new units. At KFC, we opened 566 gross new units across 58 countries, fueled by China, India and Japan. We feel good about the development momentum with the long-term global white space remaining highly attractive, particularly in Europe and East Asia, where the opportunity is vast.FWRGFor 2025, we are targeting 62 to 67 new locations. The broad geographic diversity of our new restaurant openings can be seen in the first half of this year, where we opened new restaurants in 18 markets across 15 states. In fact, our double-digit percentage growth plans for 2026 are already firmly in place, and we are nearly halfway to our target for 2027.EATWe continue to hear from the restaurant teams that TurboChef put out way less heat in the kitchen, cooks more evenly and quickly are more reliable and easier to clean than the old equipment.",
