      "text": "What happened: Earlier today, Marfig announced (here) that the agreement to sell some of its plants in Uruguay to Minerva has been automatically terminated as it reached the 24- month deadline since the signing date (Aug. 28, 2023) without the fulfillment of certain contractual conditions. According to Marfig, the two parties are no longer bound to complete the deal in Uruguay. Minerva, however, issued a separate release (here) rejecting Marfig's position, arguing the contract remains valid and that the transaction is still under review by Uruguay's antitrust authority (COPRODEC). Minerva reaffirmed its commitment to move forward with the approval process in the country.",

      "text": "Our take: At first glance, a slight negative development for Minerva, small positive for Marfig... As we wrote back in Feb'25, \"the deal materializing in Uruguay would represent an ideal scenario for BEEF considering the general understanding in the market that eventual penalties (e.g., break- up fees) could apply if it derailed\". With that in mind, we think that Marfig's announcement today represents a small negative development for Minerva at a first glance. While we are not aware of particular details regarding potential break- up fees, we think it is reasonable to assume that there could be a bear case where the non- conclusion of the transaction in Uruguay leads to some small cash disbursement from Minerva. As it pertains to Marfig, a potential/eventual cash inflow from a break- up fee would be a quite small positive outcome, but we also see another angle regarding these assets: Maintaining those plants is arguably a more attractive option today for Marfig, given that exporters in South America ex- Brazil tend to benefit from a shift of US imports from Brazil into Australia and other LatAm countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, for instance).",

      "text": "...But it is important to weigh in the fact that the companies currently disagree on the matter, creating uncertainty in the coming weeks. To be clear, in our eyes, if the deal is called off, it does represent a small negative for BEEF, and small positive for MRFG. That said, given the disagreement between the parties, we believe this matter could be extended. We note a couple of things: First, Minerva is contesting Marfig's view that the contract has reached its deadline. Second, Uruguay authorities have not made a final decision yet on Minerva's revised proposal regarding the acquisitions (i.e., selling 2 out of 3 plants that would be acquired from Marfig). Lastly, we lack detailed information regarding specific classes of the contract regarding eventual break- up fees. Given the degree of uncertainty at this point, it will be key to monitor developments regarding the transaction from COPRODEC's side, and also how both companies will engage ahead. The announcement today is too small to impair our current thesis in either of the two names (OW BEEF3, UW MRFG3), but worth monitoring in the coming weeks.",
