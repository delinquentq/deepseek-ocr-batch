That said, the missing benefits from higher mix of overseas sales, moderate FX benefits (particularly from sales to Europe), and scale in 2Q still come as a surprise and make us wonder whether there are any one- off or kitchen- sinking factors in play that make 2Q a deep margin trough with more aggressive cost reduction kicking in from 3Q.",
