      "text": "DiDi delivered a strong 2Q results beat, across revenue (+11% yoy, \\(+2\\%\\) vs. GSe) and adj. EBITA (+93% yoy, \\(+46\\%\\) ahead of GSe), on the back of China Mobility GTV growth acceleration (+12% yoy, vs. GSe of \\(+9\\%\\) yoy) with platform sales margin expansion on lower user incentives/operating leverage driving domestic GTV profit margins at the highest level in 4 years (4.4%, vs. GSe of \\(3.9\\%\\) , EBITA as \\(0\\%\\) of GTV). Other business losses came in narrower than expected (- Rmb0.4bn vs. GSe of - Rmb0.8bn) on better bike-sharing profitability, offsetting slightly wider international losses amid upfront food delivery investment in Brazil. We believe the strong results and stock reaction (with DIDY up \\(4\\%\\) vs. a flat KWEBI) highlights DiDi's long runway of operating leverage and domestic profit uplift potential, helped by a stable car hailing landscape (with mobility being our top 2 preferred sub-sectors in China Internet). While investor focuses have recently centered around 1) group profit outlook amid incremental investments into food delivery in Brazil, 2) DiDi's OTC listing status and 3) specific-city licenses ramp up (e.g. DiDi's robotaxi arm DiDi Voyager was not included in the recent Shanghai robotaxi pilot phase license issuances), we believe DiDi's strong visibility in domestic profitability improvement (with still large room for further GTV margin uplift) should help offset the gradual step-up of international food delivery investments. Meanwhile we remain confident in DiDi's leading technology stack (with approved licensing remaining Tier 1 cities, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen) and maintain it positions the company amongst the top tier robotaxi fleet developments.",

While DiDi recently announced measures to reduce commission fee (including cap maximum commission fee at \\(27\\%\\) from \\(29\\%\\) , SEOink), we believe these changes will not impact DiDi's long- term profitability given a immature proportion of orders are above the ceiling fee rate. GS view: Under Benign competitive landscape, with stable market shares at DiDi vs. aggregators like Amap, and manageable impacts from proactive reduction of ceiling services charges alongside driver supportive measures, we continue to believe DiDi has room to further increase its GTV profit margin driven by i) the increased electric vehicle adoption; ii) optimization of consumer subsidies (lowering from c. \\(10\\%\\) of GTV in 2024); iii) improved operating leverage. We now estimate GTV growth of \\(10\\% /10\\%\\) yoy (prior: \\(7\\% /9\\%\\) ) in 3QE/FY25E on the back of healthy order volume growth of \\(10\\% /11\\%\\) and stabilization in AOVs (flat yoy in 2Q), and GTV margin of \\(3.9\\% /3.9\\%\\) (prior: \\(3.8\\% /3.7\\%\\) ).",
