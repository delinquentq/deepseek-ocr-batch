(1) The explanations (previously prepared video presentations) and Q&A session at this IR Day were not held at the individual company level. The presentations centered on the business domains the company has been focusing on, and it took a new direction with the Q&A format, with the heads of the various internal companies jointly responding to questions. It appeared to us that management intended to give the impression of seamless group collaboration, and the overall flow of the event seemed to be put together well, with the CFO's opening remarks explaining the company's growth phases and the areas of focus in the medium- term business plan. The briefing materials seemed to adeptly balance facts and figures with the story management wants to express to equity markets. (2) The Q&A session contained no major surprises. Overall, our impression was that the company provided convincing explanations of its strategies, results, and future direction for its global corporate & investment banking business, an area of strength. (3) It also provided clear explanations about the scope for future growth in retail and corporate domains in Japan, in areas such as wealth management and transactions with SMEs. We look for the company to continue disclosing KPIs for its customer base and to reap the benefits of these strategies.",

As a rule, JGBs for individual investors may not be sold in the first 12 months after issuance. When JGBs for individual investors are sold before maturity, an amount calculated via the following formula will be subtracted from the par value of the bond plus accrued interest: (1) for 10- year variable rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) x 0.79685 will be used, (2) for 5- year and 3- year fixed rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) x 0.79685 will be used. When inflation- indexed JGBs are purchased via public offerings, secondary distributions (uridashi deals), or other OTC transactions with Nomura Securities, only the purchase price shall be paid, with no sales commission charged. Inflation- indexed JGBs carry the risk of losses, as prices fluctuate in line with changes in market interest rates and fluctuations in the nationwide consumer price index. The notional principal of inflation- indexed JGBs changes in line with the rate of change in nationwide CPI inflation from the time of its issuance. The amount of the coupon payment is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate by the notional principal at the time of payment. The maturity value is the amount of the notional principal when the issue becomes due. For J117 and subsequent issues, the maturity value shall not undercut the face amount.
