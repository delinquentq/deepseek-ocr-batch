      "text": "- The HIMS bear case is driven primarily by concerns that the company's GLP-1 compounding business would come to an abrupt end through regulatory or legislative action, or a court order/lawsuit win favoring Novo Nordisk.- HIMS was selling compounded drugs using the exemption associated with drugs experiencing shortages, which GLP-1s qualified under until more recently. Since then, the company has shifted its regulatory strategy around GLP-1s by continuing to compound these weight loss drugs using the FDA's personalization exemption and 503A facilities.- While seemingly operating within the bounds of current law, bearish investors are betting that the FDA or Congress could push through administrative decisions or legislate new rules, which could ultimately end HIMS' ability to compound branded medications. Additionally, some investors are trading based on the concern that Novo Nordisk could ultimately file a patent infringement suit against HIMS for compounding semaglutide.- Our Take: We think that Novo's strategy of targeted state lawsuits against smaller compounders will not deter HIMS from compounding semaglutide, since most of these lawsuits, so far, target unethical compounders committing blatant trademark violations. A patent infringement lawsuit against HIMS would be drawn out for years before a settlement or judgment could be reached that would potentially be right around when generic semaglutide becomes available. We see a preliminary injunction in such a case as very unlikely since Novo would have to establish that it faces irreparable harm without one and that an injunction would be in the public interest. We don't think Novo can prove either without a manufacturing safety issue or proof of deceptive branding.",
