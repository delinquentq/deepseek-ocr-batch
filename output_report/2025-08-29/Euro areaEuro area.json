      "text": "This week started with a focus on French politics. French Prime Minister Bayrou is poised to lose a vote of confidence in the lower house, likely followed by President Macron appointing a new Prime Minister. New lower house elections cannot be ruled out, but what remains very unlikely is that Macron himself resigns. Still, the fiscal implications look manageable. Bayrou had proposed a 2026 budget with a fiscal tightening of \\(0.9\\%\\) of GDP, significantly more than the \\(0.5\\%\\) of GDP required by the EU's fiscal rules. We had projected a tightening of \\(0.4\\%\\) of GDP and that remains a reasonable outcome. The Left coalition is unlikely to emerge as winner, should new elections be held, while the far-right RN has dropped many of its fiscal demands and has stressed the importance of adhering to the EU's fiscal rules. This likely reflects nervousness about triggering market fallout ahead of the 2027 presidential election.",

The region has come a long way from the days when a weaker institutional setting, a lack of (conditional) support mechanisms, and more fundamental challenges to fiscal orthodoxy resulted in more extreme markets pressures and spillovers across countries. Today, the mere possibility of market pressure appears sufficient to encourage most political parties to commit to sustainable fiscal trajectories, coupled with broader reforms. Crucially, even most nonmainstream parties are keenly aware that countries qualify for the various ECB bond market programs only if they have made such commitments as a precondition. In this sense, the region has moved from a bad equilibrium to a good one, with",

However, even that smaller decline would leave the annual rate of core inflation very close to the ECB's target and would imply a monthly increase in core prices in the middle of the \\(0.1 - 0.2\\% \\mathrm{m / m}\\) , sa, range. Combined with last month's increase of \\(0.19\\% \\mathrm{m / m}\\) , sa, and the two softer releases before that, it would leave recent core price momentum at or below the ECB's target, albeit with some noise. In addition, we expect only a modest \\(0.21\\% \\mathrm{m / m}\\) , sa, increase in services prices, which would seem consistent with the slowing in wage inflation. More surprisingly, core goods inflation appears to have picked up recently, despite the clear downward pressures from the stronger currency and the threat of Chinese trade diversion effects. If those core goods pressures fade in the next few months, it would help to pull core inflation below the ECB target.",

This is consistent with an economy that is growing at around trend, rather than accelerating above it. Similarly, car registrations have been stable at a low level in recent months, rather than showing any credit- driven pickup. Of course, structural issues may be impacting the demand for cars, given the transition to EVs. However, bank lending for house purchase has also not accelerated further recently and is therefore still a tick below a \\(3\\%\\) (Figure 7).",

The underlying details, released for the first time, revealed a significant drag from net exports (-2.7%-pts contribution) following a surge in 1Q25, primarily driven by the frontloading of sales to the US. An increase in inventories (+1.4%-pts cont.), which had been depleted in 1Q25 to satisfy export demand, only partially offset this drag. But the weak figures were also underpinned by subdued domestic demand (+1%-pt contr.) amid elevated uncertainty and downbeat sentiment, particularly among households, despite ongoing strength in the labor market and real income growth. Private consumption (-0.2%q/q saar) has broadly stagnated after three quarters of modest growth. Meanwhile, investment remained steady (+4.2%q/q saar), as gross fixed capital formation continued to be supported by Next Generation EU investments. But it is also noteworthy that residential investment continued to hold up, increasing by 2.5%q/q saar, despite the end of the Superbonus.

      "text": "The final release from Istat confirmed that the Italian economy contracted by 0.3%q/q saar in 2Q25, following a 1.3%q/q saar gain in 1Q25. The underlying details, released for the first time, revealed a significant drag from net exports (-2.7%-pts contribution) following a surge in 1Q25, primarily driven by the frontloading of sales to the US. An increase in inventories (+1.4%-pts cont.), which had been depleted in 1Q25 to satisfy export demand, only partially offset this drag. But the weak figures were also underpinned by subdued domestic demand (+1%-pt contr.) amid elevated uncertainty and downbeat sentiment, particularly among households, despite ongoing strength in the labor market and real income growth. Private consumption (-0.2%q/q saar) has broadly stagnated after three quarters of modest growth. Meanwhile, investment remained steady (+4.2%q/q saar), as gross fixed capital formation continued to be supported by Next Generation EU investments. But it is also noteworthy that residential investment continued to hold up, increasing by 2.5%q/q saar, despite the end of the Superbonus. A rebound in government consumption (+0.7%q/q saar) also played some role in offsetting the trade drag and weakness in private consumption.",

This still leaves the level of the survey weak by historical standards. The August IFO increase comes after a 0.3pt rise in the composite PMI to 50.9 last week. The PMI is our preferred measure to track GDP and this survey is broadly aligned with our 3Q \\(0.75\\%\\) ar forecast (raised last week from \\(0.5\\%\\) ar). Recent German GDP data were impacted by frontloading (a boost in 1Q followed by payback in 2Q) and averaged \\(0.6\\%\\) ar in 1H. Our 3Q forecast only represents a modest momentum increase compared to 1H and we expect the German economy to expand at a similar pace in 4Q. Fiscal easing next year will be a strong boost for German growth, gradually lifting growth to a \\(1.75\\%\\) ar pace by 2H26, in our view.",
