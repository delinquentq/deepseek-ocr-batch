Growing resource/production optionality across both assets: We see room for continued margin performance at Karlawinda with steady state operations, and with production growth optionality through the Karlawinda Mill expansion. Though Mt. Gibson is pre-construction, we see the ramp up roughly doubling group gold production. Further resource/reserve expansion across both assets (including recent neighboring tenement acquisitions), along with emerging underground resource optionality (Karlawinda not in GSe base case) may also provide upside to volumes where higher grade material can displace lower grade open pit ore. While we note that historically mining stocks tend to underperform through the execution and ramp up phase of a project, we expect cash flow from Karlawinda to significantly de-risk the impact from delays/overruns (over and above what we already conservatively factor in), where the business/management have a strong history of execution/value creation.",
