In addition, we note the company turned from 297 net closures in 1Q25 to 9 net opening in 2Q25. The company announced an interim dividend of RMB0.33 per share, implying \\(14\\%\\) dividend payout ratio, vs. GSe of RMB1.91 or \\(45\\%\\) payout for full year 2025. We think the 2Q better sales but lower GPM is likely indicative of the company's strategies to increase franchises' incentives/rebates to boost sell- in inventories.",
