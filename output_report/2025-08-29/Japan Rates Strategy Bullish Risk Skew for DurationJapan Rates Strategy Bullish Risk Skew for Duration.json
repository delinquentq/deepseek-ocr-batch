BoJ board member Nakagawa didn't hint at anything regarding the next rate hike, but she mentioned that the next Tanakan will be important. Hence, the market continues to price in roughly a \\(50\\%\\) chance of an October hike. That said, Japan's production/export and US labor market data, which BoJ Governor Ueda mentioned in July's MPM to assess the impact of US tariff policy, have started to show some weakness. Further deterioration in those numbers may cause markets to start pricing in a dovish pivot by the BoJ. Speculation about the MoF's further issuance reduction supported long- end JGBs this week, but we think it would not be enough to stabilize supply/demand in the long end. As such, we maintain long 10y JGB, JGB 10s30s steepener and short 30y JGB ASW. We think that current long- end JGB buyers would flip to sellers on any strength.",
