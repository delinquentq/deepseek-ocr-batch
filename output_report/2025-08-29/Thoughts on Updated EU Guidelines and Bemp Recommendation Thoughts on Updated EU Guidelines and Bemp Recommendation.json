While we are still waiting on updated US guidelines (ACC guidelines for cholesterol were last updated in 2018), which would be more important in accelerating uptake in the US, EU guidelines could influence US guidelines and today's update is a step in the right direction in moving bemp up as an earlier line therapy. Importantly, consensus for bemp at &#36;170M for 2025 seems achievable and doesn't seem to factor in potential tailwinds from stronger uptake off of updated guidelines, so there could be upside to numbers this year.",

Entresto received Class I recommendations early in the launch, and both US and EU guidelines were published simultaneously, though US guidelines came in 6 months earlier than NVS expected - so for ESPR US guidelines could similarly be months behind today's published EU guidelines. NVS was hampered by coverage and prior auhs despite the guideline updates, but for bemp coverage has largely been addressed by ESPR and there is limited pushback from payers - hence we view updated guidelines as a \"cleaner\" growth driver for bemp in supporting earlier line usage by docs.",
