Here DELL executed on strong AI server delivery (\\$8.2b vs. JPM \\\\(7.2b), and announced robust incremental orders (\\)5.6b) to support a strong backlog. The team raised its revenue outlook by over 3% at the midpoint (driven by AI Server strength) and earnings outlook by about half that amount. Margins are being impacted by AI server supply chain inefficiencies (including expedite costs) further pressuring ISG margins beyond the already expected pressure from competitive AI server deals (to win business with concentrated customers). This all takes conversations back to concerns about the aggressive bids to win concentrated customers, and lumpiness in demand. On the positive side, a big move in the FY AI server orders outlook from \\(15b+\\) to \\(20b\\) at lease underscores DELL's competitiveness. That offsets some incremental weakness in traditional infrastructure demand, where expectations for Storage and traditional Server demand have deteriorated (in addition to a modest shortfall in CSG)... these to a",

Here I had no fun on the MRVL earnings call last night, but I had a blast writing my MRVL earnings takeaways note, which was mainly a collection of feedback from you investors. Please have a look. Meanwhile, after his callback Harlan Sur shared his own recap. MRVL printed an in- line Jul- Q with upside in consumer demand offsetting a little weakness in Data Center, Carrier Infrastructure, and Enterprise Networking; and the team guides to an in- line Oct- Q (if you adjust for divestiture of its auto ethernet business). The core business guide is largely in- line, though end- market mix differs from expectations. The team expects only flatish Data Center revenues, offset by a strong acceleration in Carrier Infrastructure & Enterprise Networking (+30%QoQ). These are slightly weaker results than we expected - above all as strong global AI spending trends are not being seen at MRVL. Indeed, the team implicitly guides a double- digit sequential drop in custom ASIC (due to \"lumpiness\") before that important business re- accelerates in the Jan- Q. They still see a stronger 2H for custom ASIC, but offered no updates on AMZN Trainium 3/4 nor Microsoft MAIA 3nm/2nm programs (citing non- disclosure/confidentiality agreements). Harlan's checks indicate that both the 3nm Trainium and 3nm Maia programs are on track for production in CY26. Longer- term, the team continues to expand its AI ASIC design win pipeline and has secured additional sockets (on top of the 18 sockets disclosed at the analyst day). AI networking demand remains strong, driven by 800G PAM4 DSP product; demand for the 1.6T PAM4 DSP is also beginning to ramp up. Harlan underscores that the team's AI- related programs and products (optical/ASICs) are on track to drive a strong C25 (+2x YoY) and C26. Harlan takes down his F27 earnings and also moves from a 35x to a 33x target multiple taking TP down \\(7.7\\%\\) to \\$120",
