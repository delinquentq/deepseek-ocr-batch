Among Medtech stocks, we like Shimadzu on expectations for an upward revision to FY3/26 earnings guidance, whereas other names like Terumo and Fujifilm remain attractive for their stable earnings prospects. We downgraded Olympus to Neutral on 26 Aug (see report: Down to Neutral: no longer undervalued given weak earnings and reduced visibilities). For Healthcare Services, we believe the strong earnings have already been baked into the share price, so we regard JMDC as attractive. Our Medley recommendation has not yet panned out, but it has become even more undervalued relative to the underlying growth potential. That said, we do not anticipate share- price upside until earnings are confirmed in the Jul- Sep results.",

For Daiichi Sankyo, our focus is on the 7 Sep WCLC presentation of the final analysis of the pivotal study (IDate- Lung01: 3L therapy for small cell lung cancer) for I- DXd, the third candidate to emerge from the company's proprietary antibody- drug conjugate (ADC) platform. Promising data have already been released, and we look for disclosure of more detailed data to again underscore D- Sankyo's ADC technology. We look for 2H catalysts - i.e., US approval of siberpenlimab and US filings for centanafadine and zipalertinib - to boost Otsuka's share price. Although we rate Chugai Neutral due to its high valuations, we need to scrutinize Ph3 (ATTAIN- 1, ATTAIN- 2) results of oral GLP- 1 orforglipron, which is licensed to Eli Lilly. Orforglipron demonstrated superior weight reduction for obese patients with type 2 diabetes over competing compounds, including already commercialized drugs, but the rate of weight reduction appears to be inferior for obese patients without diabetes. An important consideration in forecasting market share for GLP- 1R agonists is the impact of GI adverse events on oral medication compliance.",

Sysmex's earnings results were disappointing and there is still a risk of a downward revision to guidance, but the share price has declined so much that it looks undervalued. Key themes for Medtech stocks are market trends in North America and China. Recurring demand (e.g., surgeries) is robust, but sluggish capex- related demand persists. The key point for capex- oriented stocks is market cultivation with new products. Olympus looks to start local production and marketing of GI endoscopes in China through a newly established factory, while Shimadzu aims to launch new products in North America and Sysmex is focused on expanding its product line- up through business collaborations and M&A. We downgraded Olympus to Neutral on 26 Aug (see report: Down to Neutral: no longer undervalued given weak earnings and reduced visibilities).",

Healthcare Services businesses are mainly centered on the domestic market, so the April 2026 healthcare reforms will be a key issue. M3, Medley, and JMDC are positioned to benefit from the full- scale government promotion of medical DX. Reform measures, such as the NHI drug revisions, dispensing fee revisions, and promotion of generic drugs will be used to fund higher wages in the medical and welfare industries. The reform measures will likely be negative for dispensing pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers but positive for generic drug manufacturers.",

Chugai's sluggish 1H earnings results were attributed to delayed shipments of Hemlibra (hemophilia A), but the termination of five development projects, including mid- sized molecule drug LUNA18, was seen as negative. Santen's depressed 1Q results were due to excess distribution inventories, but production of Diquas LX has already resumed, and management expected earnings to recover from 2H.
