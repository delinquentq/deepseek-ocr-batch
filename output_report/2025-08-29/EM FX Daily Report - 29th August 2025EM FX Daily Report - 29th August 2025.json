There was however, a little move lower down to 80.00 in the last couple of hours or so, with location driving the move. We are, if anything, seeing better corporate right hand side flow in NDFs, but it's being comfortably absorbed by the onshore selling. Still holding a modest usd short, picking up 3- 4 kopeck carry per day.",

I hold a small short after selling towards 17.75, but can't say I am feeling too enthused. Perhaps we need to get month end out the way, but am conscious that whilst dollar shorts makes sense, any turn in risk (i.e. off Fed independence), would see me cut. Flow wise we saw some RM ZAR demand however systematics selling rand for the second consecutive day.",

It must be noted that this was a 4 day roll instead of the regular 3- day roll, which may partially account for the larger adjustment. Monitoring the adjustments early next week will be crucial to reassess our assumptions regarding the pace of nominal depreciation, which explains the option related outflows this morning, though volumes traded at state bank offers remain limited (approx \\(\\) 300\\(mio). Following the round trip after the Jackson Hole, the broad dollar seems to be in consolidation mode, but we maintain a preference for weaker USD ahead of the US NFP next week. Meanwhile, we continue to run long TRY positions while keeping an eye on the adjustments next week. We still think that CBT's focus on real TRY appreciation should remain an anchor for the long TRY view and continue to perform in absence of any meaningful political risk events until the CHP court case on 15 September.",

Whilst there are positives for HUF (hawkish NBH, carry, ToTs, lower gas), these are not really new stories and so struggle to see what takes EURHUF below the recent range. The other tailwind of Russia/Ukraine also continues to distance, with Merz saying a Zelensky/Putin meet is unlikely. All this being said, still happy to hold a core EURHUF short whilst vol is low, at least to earn some carry.",
