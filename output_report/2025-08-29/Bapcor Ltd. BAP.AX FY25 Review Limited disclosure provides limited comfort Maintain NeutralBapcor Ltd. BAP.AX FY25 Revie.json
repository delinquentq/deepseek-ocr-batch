Operationally, the limited disclosure on recent trading or FY26 expectations creates risk and uncertainty, in our view, given that May/June were previously noted to have been particularly weak and the limited evidence to suggest that performance has turned. Combined with FY26 guidance for Npat to be 2H weighted, we are cautious as to whether this implies that 2H26 performance will be stronger or 1H26 softer. In aggregate, we continue to see Bapcor at the relatively early stage of the development and implementation of their proposed strategic initiatives with evidence of stabilisation required for us to turn more positive.
