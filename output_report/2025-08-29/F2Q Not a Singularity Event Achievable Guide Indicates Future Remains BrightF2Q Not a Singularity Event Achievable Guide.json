F2Q incremental ARR (not accounting for churn) showed positive sequential growth to ~&#36;53M (vs &#36;28M in 1Q). If we account for churn, we calculate that new business grew 25% yoy in F2Q vs down 7% in F1Q on a flat comp making the execution notable. While some of this was from slipped F1Q deals (not quantified), the majority of this strength was new logo and cross-sell traction. While it is likely too early to account for success from the new Flex program in the F2Q beat, it is fair to assume that NNARR will follow an improved shape & likely grow in 2H given the raised FY26 revenue guide.",
