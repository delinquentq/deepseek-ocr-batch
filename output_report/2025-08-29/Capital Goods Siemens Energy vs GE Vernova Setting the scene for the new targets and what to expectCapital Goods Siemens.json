Pre- existing targets for mid- term targets are for 2028, and it is unclear at this stage whether both companies will update the 2028 guidance or roll the guidance forward to 2029 or 2030.

What is clear from the re- ratings, and the favourable end- market dynamics, is that investor expectations in both cases have run ahead of the sell- side consensus. From our perspective, we do not look at the new guidance as representing the maximum potential on profitability for either stock. Instead, we think both companies will continue to seek a balance between managing investor expectations while also giving themselves room to continue to 'beat and raise' in the next 12- 24 months. That said, based on our conversations with investors, our clear sense is that expectations for GE Vernova appear more elevated than what appears to be is assumed for Siemens Energy (Exhibit 2).",

On the other hand, we think this debate has kept more of a lid on buy- side expectations, and ultimately we think it gives more room for Siemens Energy's new mid- term targets, which will be issued on 14th November, to be a positive catalyst for the stock. Ultimately, when we look at quantitative evidence so far (Exhibit 3 to Exhibit 6) we can see Siemens Energy's Gas services margins are broadly in line with GEV's Power margins, and Siemens Energy's Grid margins are ahead of GEV's Electrification margins.",

GEV also sits on a strong net cash position and is positioned to generate substantial FCF through 2028e. 3) Wind strategy - we do not expect anything to be announced in the short term, as both companies remain committed to turning around profitability in their respective divisions.

(2) Prices have started to stabilize at levels in 2024 that are 80- 90% higher than 2020 levels (Exhibit 20). Capacity is being added, but it takes time. Hitachi appears to be doubling transformer capacity, and Fortune Electric's capacity is also likely to have doubled by 2027. High voltage capacity additions should continue to bring down lead times for transformers as new capacity comes on line in 2027. Siemens Energy's annual grid sales are typically made up of \\(50\\%\\) products (1- 2 year lead times) and \\(50\\%\\) solutions (where orders may be booked in 2028 or beyond).

So we have a bit more to the back to the situation, as Am-Sofia also referred to over lead times today, it's more - it's not back to, let's say, normal, but it is shorter. So the capacity is more in place, which also leads to, I don't expect a lot of help from price in 2025. So it's more of the self-help that is needed.GE VernovaQ1 2025 (23/04/2025)We do continue to be gaining price in electrification, but at a slower rate than what we were experiencing in '24, let's say. And it varies a little bit by geography and by product type. So switchgears in North America remain very strong in price, a little bit more of a normalization with some of our product and solutions in Europe as an example.Siemens EnergyQ2 2025 (08/05/2025)We have seen the pricing momentum in '25 is, let's say, less pronounced than in '24. I mean very clearly, there has been a substantial uplift in '24, and this is what we also shared with you in the quarterly result and showed you the development, but the prices are still improving. We do see, obviously, pricing getting prolonged some time in the discussions, which obviously shows also that it's getting difficult in terms of the overall project investment decision. So I would expect this to taper off to a certain extent. [...] And this is why we continue to work also now on, obviously, cost-out measures, making sure that we remain competitive. Obviously, the general net pricing in GS remains on a high level, GT as well, but somewhat stabilizing is what you see. We see continued improvement if I look on compression in the T1 side and onshore and offshore and wind, I see rather stabilizing.Schneider ElectricQ4 2024 (20/02/2025)So I'm not aware that we saw anything in particular, I would say, in the second half versus the first half in terms of Systems pricing. There's a lot of demand in Systems generally in Data Center, but not only, and therefore, we've done what we believe is the right pricing strategy, not just this year, but even for a couple of years now in Systems. So I think probably nothing to call out there aside from, like I mentioned and exactly what you said, we're done some strong pricing there over the past couple of years. We would expect some normalization of that in 2025.",
