      "text": "Our take: In the four weeks to 10th August 2025, the total market grew \\(4.0\\%\\) vs \\(5.4\\%\\) in the previous four weeks (in the context of 110 bps tougher comps) with grocery price inflation at \\(5.0\\%\\) (slightly down vs \\(5.2\\%\\) prior). Market polarisation continued, with Tesco and Sainsbury still comfortably outperforming Asda and Morrison. The data: Total till roll growth: Market \\(+4\\%\\) , Tesco \\(+7.1\\%\\) , Sainsbury \\(+4.8\\%\\) , Asda \\(- 2.1\\%\\) , Aldi \\(+3.2\\%\\) , Lidl \\(+10.3\\%\\) , Morrisons \\(+0.3\\%\\) . Total till roll market share: Tesco \\(+81\\) bps, Sainsbury \\(+12\\) bps, Asda \\(- 75\\) bps, Aldi \\(- 8\\) bps, Lidl \\(+46\\) bps, Morrisons \\(- 31\\) bps. Continued momentum: The marginal data implies an acceleration vs July for both Tesco and Sainsbury in terms of market share gains with modestly lower growth rates (previous Tesco growth run rate \\(+8.2\\%\\) with market share \\(+75\\) bps), and Sainsbury (previous Sainsbury growth run rate \\(+6.0\\%\\) with market share \\(+10\\) bps). Read to our stance: We have an OW stance on both shares based on sound fundamentals and continued execution of the right strategy. Momentum above expectations underpins the shares' re- rating.",

Our fundamental credit view of an issuer is based on the company's underlying credit trends, overall creditworthiness and our opinion on whether the issuer will be able to service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We analyze, among other things, the company's cash flow capacity and trends and standard credit ratios, such as gross and net leverage, interest coverage and liquidity ratios. We also analyze profitability, capitalization and asset quality, among other variables, when assessing financials. Analysts also rate the issuer, based on the rating of the benchmark or representative security. Unless we specify a different recommendation for the company's individual securities, an issuer recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the issuer's capital structure. We may also rate certain loans and preferred securities, as applicable. This report also sets out within it the material underlying assumptions used. We use the following ratings for bonds (issues), issuers, loans, and preferred securities: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector, or benchmark); and Underweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this particular security or issuer because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. For CDS, we use the following rating system: Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or benchmark); Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or benchmark); and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant index, sector or benchmark).",
