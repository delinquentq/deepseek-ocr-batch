Hon Hai was viewed by investors as incrementally positive given further GPU, ASIC and sovereign AI wins, and even guided towards potentially half the AI server board market share. May imply some upside to investor models as confirms sense is out- executing the competition. Gokul continued to push ASE on raising pricing as co confirmed ASP upward reversions w/ new products which can provide some upside to earnings which is not fully modeled by the street nor sense from investors. Final test AI GPU market share gain vs KYEC remains a key investor debate, as ASE FY26 baseline share is generally considered to be \\(\\sim 30\\%\\) . Lastly, Alchip 2nm AI Accelerator (AWS) project win has been flagged in prior calls including 2Q and at our conference. MRVL miss and guidance is not a surprise to Asian investors given Alchip hold on AWS",

Hon Hai also expects to expand its customer base in ASIC from one to 3 customers in FY25- Extending value chain presence to L11+ would likely lift LT margins: Hon Hai extending AI server value chain form L11- > H11+ thru a partnership w/ Teco and further vertical integration into data center infrastructure components - sources power supplies from vendors as Delta. Enhances value capture- More positive on sovereign AI, FY26 likely revenue contribution: believes the co will capture significant share in this category, w/ some projects already ramping, contributing to FY26 rev.

Full process (FoCoS + Bridge) a small part of revs but could surpass oS we believe possibly in FY27- Major AI GPU final testing revenue to start from 4Q; guides ASIC customers: potential AI GPU final testing starting in 4Q. Expects higher share in Rubin in FY26 w/ over more than one ASIC customer. Share vs KYEC has been widely watched by investors. Chip probing related projects for AI have already started ramping since early FY25 mostly from TSMC in our view.- Price increases to wait for new project kick-off, environment appears favorable to us: states meaningful increases in adjustments may have to wait until new product introductions, w/ more discussions expected in FY26. We believe ASE should be able to raise pricing on several leading edge advanced packaging and HPC projects given strong fabless, design service vendors' demand. Smaller volume projects in flip chip packaging, testing and LEAP. This has been a major issue which Gokul has been pushing and not consensus- Investor feedback: plenty of investor debate on KYEC vs ASE final test AI GPU share into FY26, \\(30\\%\\) seems a baseline. Gokul continues to push the co on raising pricing as his view is not fully consensus among his peers nor fully modeled by investors. Price hikes / ASP upward reversions w/ new products can be accretive to earnings and serve as an upside catalyst",

Mass production likely FY28 at earliest. Mgmt. expressed strong confidence about third-party IP readiness, which was an issue in the prior generation - and a question among investors. Notes Synopsys and Cadence are focused in this area, and key clients stick to same vendors for multiple design cycles- Competing for another CSP on AI accelerator project: expressed optimism about being invited to compete. Highly complex project involving 3.5D packaging, main comps Broadcom, MediaTek, likely Marvell. We believe is likely for a US social media CSP AI ASIC (Meta), but we do not believe Alchip has a high chance of winning given the high complexity. Investors are not modeling this incremental win- Auto ADAS project on track w/ more engagements: major ADAS project w/ a China EV maker (we believe Li Auto) commence in 4Q, w/ growth into FY26.

Nvidia has been tens of billions of dollars of GB300 revenues in Jul-Q w/ smooth rack-level system ramp. We expect TSMC to start Rubin production in 2Q26, which would precipitate a Hynix HBM4 contract signing. We expect a smooth GB300 transition to Vera Rubin, which bodes well for Hon Hai, Quanta, Wistron as expect server mass production into 2H26. Strong performance upgrades bode well for component vendors as power - Delta, substrate - Unimicron, and CCL - EMC- Exponential networking revenue growth on growing GPU cluster size. Momentum likely to sustain given GB200/300 NVL72 ramp in 2H. As GPU clusters grow w/ higher number of GPUs and switches, this drives rising interconnection demand inside- and inter-rack driving scale-up and scale-out across datacenters. Key beneficiaries optical component vendors Innolight, cable/connector vendors Bizlink, Amphenol, TE Connectivity- We believe NVDA maintains a strong complete solution vs ASICs.
