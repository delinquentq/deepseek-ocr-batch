Ryanair will announce the reduction next Wednesday. Eddie Wilson, Ryanair DAC CEO, said cuts could leave Spanish regions with \"fewer passengers, fewer jobs, fewer connections, and fewer opportunities for tourism\". Ryanair is already withdrawing from smaller regional airports where support packages have been withdrawn. In our view, airport charges in Spain are low compared to across Europe. It is no surprise to see Ryanair lobby against airport charges increases, but we think the greater impact on Ryanair's Spanish economics comes from the scale of marketing support and the price of handling by airport.",

This model starts with invested capital, then assesses the net present value of the economic value created or destroyed during a five- year explicit forecast period, during a subsequent 20- year value driver period in which we assume EBIT levels and growth rates are held stable, and finally during a three- year fade period in which we assume economic value creation (or destruction) fades to zero. The advantage of our three- stage DCF model is that it takes into account our explicit forecasts for the coming five years, rather than just as single year. The valuation is also explicit about the assumed mid- term profitability of the business. The valuation method does not include a terminal value. Our AF- KLM €10.50 price target is based on a mid- term EBIT margin of \\(5.0\\%\\) and a WACC of \\(5.9\\%\\) .",

This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG- related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG- related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction- specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.",
