The improvement in the trade balance was the result of stronger exports (3.4%/m/m, sa; 17.3%oya) vis- a- vis imports (- 4.1%/m/m, sa; 2.3%oya).",

The increase in tech exports extended beyond semiconductors as well (Figure 1), supported by a still resilient external demand backdrop and an improvement in the supply glut situation (Figure 2). By trading destination, shipments to all major economies (e.g. US, China, EU, ASEAN) broadly held up (Figure 3). We maintain our cautious outlook for exports as frontloading unwinds, US end- demand slows, and the impact of reciprocal tariffs (19%) starts to bite in earnest, consistent with our in- house US imports forecast profile (Figure 4). The risk is that the upcoming tariff shock will be diluted by the slow pass- through to US inflation and other policy tailwinds (e.g., Fed rate cuts).",

Within the financial account, foreign portfolio inflows strengthened materially (Figure 8), likely in response to positive news flow surrounding local currency government bonds (e.g. index inclusion). Our forward- looking view of the BOP is nuanced (Table 2). Although we still think that the current account (CA) deficit will widen further on weaker exports, the financial account may still be supported by foreign bond inflows amidst benign external financial conditions.",
