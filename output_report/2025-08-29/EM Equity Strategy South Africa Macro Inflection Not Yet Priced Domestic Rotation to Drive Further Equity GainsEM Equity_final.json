In contrast to the mainstream view, we see the growth shortfall as largely cyclical, held back by headwinds such as restrictive monetary policy. As these headwinds fade and as supply constraints also ease (e.g., in energy and logistics), we forecast that growth will accelerate from \\(1.0\\%\\) in 2025 to \\(1.6\\%\\) in 2026, reaching about \\(2.5\\%\\) in the medium term. If combined with fiscal consolidation, this potentially supports a case for sovereign credit rating upgrades - a positive inflection point that we think is not yet priced into South African assets. Equities have performed well (MXZA is up nearly \\(30\\%\\) ytd), but the rally has been narrow, led by Commodity Exporters, while the domestic pockets have been mostly flat ytd. A growth rebound could catalyze a rotation from selective exporters into Domestic Cyclicals.",

Market pricing does not fully reflect this: the local yield curve partly embeds sustained disinflation, and the market remains sceptical of a lower policy- rate path, while consensus expectations of ongoing fiscal slippage keep the curve steep and real yields elevated. Our inflation and rate views are dovish (aligned with the SARB's projections) and we view the fiscal plan as credible - supporting a bull- flattening of the yield curve and higher local equities via a lower equity risk premium and the market's high sensitivity to rates. Sector- wise, Banks and Retailers have outperformed Defensives and Exporters in past periods of declining rates. Moreover, South African Banks' profitability and ROEs have historically lagged their EM peers, alongside a weaker fiscal track record; a firmer fiscal trajectory and growth upturn could lift Bank ROEs, support higher valuations, and help sustain dividend payouts over time.",

That said, we argue that growth headwinds are now fading and that fiscal outturns are improving (with public debt likely to stabilize this year and gradually decline thereafter). This suggests an inflection point in South Africa's credit trajectory that bodes more positively for the near- term growth outlook and for a market re- rating of the country's medium- term economic prospects. In our assessment, this outlook is not reflected in the local yield curve (characterized by steepness and high real yields), external debt (where spreads are wide compared with BB- rated peers), or currency and equity valuations (that embed a weaker growth and dimmer sovereign credit rating outlook).",

Put differently, our long- standing estimates of trend growth of around \\(2 - 2.5\\%\\) - arrived at using bottom- up, top- down, and cross- country modeling frameworks - have never been as pessimistic as the official- sector or consensus views that trend growth has fallen to as low as \\(1 - 1.5\\%\\) in recent years. In our assessment, coincident indicators from the labor market and wage and consumer inflation are consistent with this narrative: as growth has slowed to around \\(1\\%\\) in the past decade, the unemployment rate has steadily risen above its longer- run average, wage growth has slowed sharply in real terms, and underlying consumer price pressures have been very subdued.",

While our analysis places more emphasis on cyclical headwinds than the mainstream view - including tight demand policies, low confidence, and weak external demand - structural factors have also played a role. On this front, supply constraints have visibly eased, with more consistent electricity provision since March 2024 as load- shedding has largely ended, and higher rail and port freight volumes as logistical constraints have become somewhat less severe. Our recent analysis suggests that a major headwind to growth in recent years has been the central bank's restrictive monetary policy stance, on our estimates holding back growth by an annual \\(0.5 - 1\\) pp in 2023- 24 relative to our estimate of a neutral monetary policy setting. As the interest rate cycle has turned and as low inflation is now supporting real income growth, we see a case for an acceleration in economic growth in the coming quarters. Indeed, our 'beancount' estimate of growth for Q2 suggests upside risks to our standing forecast of \\(+0.5\\%\\) qoq (above the SARB's and consensus forecasts of \\(+0.4\\%\\) qoq). Our baseline expectation is that the recovery in growth that we pencil in over the remainder of this year will be led by the consumer, followed by a more gradual improvement in fixed investment over the medium term.

This explains the current weak inflation dynamics, as well as the better behavior of core inflation relative to other EM and DM economies during the pandemic period. Our most out- of- consensus view in the past year has been on inflation, with a sharply lower forecast than most, and our forecasts remain low: we expect \\(3.3\\%\\) average inflation in 2026 and a decline to \\(3.1\\%\\) in 2027, below consensus of \\(4.1\\%\\) and \\(4.2\\%\\) (respectively). A large negative output gap also implies room for a strong cyclical recovery that does not erode spare capacity meaningfully or generate inflation, our central scenario. We pencil in an acceleration in growth from \\(1.0\\%\\) in 2025 to \\(1.6\\%\\) in 2026 and to \\(2.0\\%\\) in 2027, with our longer- term GDP growth forecasts at \\(2.5\\%\\) .

Thus, South Africa's exposure to the external environment, both via demand and terms of trade (export price) channels, is considerable. Exposure to cross- border financial flows is also meaningful, with significant foreign holdings of South African domestic debt and equities. These flows are sensitive to global risk sentiment, as well as to other macro factors (including the broad Dollar and US rates), factors that explain the Rand's historically high market beta to global factors. As foreigners have incrementally disinvested from South Africa and as local institutional investors have increased their offshore holdings, however, the country's net international portfolio investment position has turned positive, a factor that we argue should ultimately decrease the Rand's global beta over time.",

South Africa's two largest trading partners are Europe and China, and our medium- term view on growth in the former is relatively constructive and on the latter is more cautious. Although trade exposure to the US is not that high, the \\(30\\%\\) import tariffs put in place by the Trump administration represent a meaningful headwind to South Africa's automotive sector and to some agricultural exports, even if the overall macro impact of these tariffs is unlikely to be very large. On the positive side, however, terms of trade developments have been supportive: precious metal prices have rallied sharply (up \\(50\\%\\) on a weighted- average basis since end- 2023), with gold prices up \\(61\\%\\) and PGM prices up \\(33\\%\\) over this period. This feeds into exporter margins – precious metal export prices in ZAR terms are at an all- time high – and supports external balances, as well as the fiscal position (through corporate income tax receipts on the back of higher profitability). That said, the read- through from positive terms of trade developments into growth is unclear, given that fiscal windfalls tend to be saved (at least in large part) and that spillovers from higher private sector profitability to either labor or capital are likely limited, i.e., workers are unlikely to see much higher wages and companies are unlikely to increase investment on the back of temporarily higher export prices.",

      "text": "4) Intra-sector opportunities: Retailers to lead; Gold Miners vs. PGMs. For investors looking for intra-sector opportunities, we think Retailers should perform the best among the Domestic sectors. Historically, Retailers have outperformed in periods of declining rates and have higher leverage to an underlying consumption recovery than Banks and Defensives. Moreover, although Banks should benefit from stronger loan growth and a lower cost of risk, they could see some offsets from margin pressure with lower rates. Within Exporters, the rally in Gold Miners has been backed by underlying earnings accrual and could extend given our positive outlook for gold prices. On the other hand, PGMs appear vulnerable given valuation-led gains so far and a weaker outlook for earnings and PGM prices.",
