We downgrade Alfen from Hold to Underperform, with a lowered €8.0 PT (vs. €12.0 previously), after the recent FY26E guidance downgrade, reflecting increasing competition in EV Charging in the home segment, permitting delays and labour shortages holding back grid upgrades, and lower battery prices, as well as increased mid- term uncertainty in all segments. 1H25 revenues decreased 14% to €211.5m, driven by 27% lower revenues in Energy Storage Systems, after 40% lower battery prices, and 23% lower revenues in EV Charging, reflecting intensified competition in the home segment. 1H25 adjusted EBITDA decreased only 4% to €13.0m, as cost measures are yielding results, resulting in a 70bps higher EBITDA margin at 6.2%, after 10% lower personnel costs, and 18% lower other exp. For FY25E, Alfen expects c. 7% lower revenues in the range of €430m- €480m, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 5%- 8%, supported by cost savings of €13.0m from last year's 15% headcount reduction. We have made mid- teens cuts to our adjusted EBITDA estimates, reflecting weakening gross margins in 2H25E, due to increasing competition in EV Charging, increasing component costs for smart grids, and a normalisation of gross margins in Energy Storage, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 5.5% for FY25E, near the low- end of the FY25E guidance range of 5%- 8%. Alfen now sees a more limited 0%- 5% revenue recovery for FY26E, vs. 5%- 10% previously, leading to a relatively more stable EBITDA margin of 5%- 8%, vs. high- single digit previously, and drops guidance for a return to a low- double digit EBITDA margin in the medium- term.

We downgrade Fugro from Hold to Underperform, with a lowered €10.0 PT (vs. €12.5 previously), as the targeted profitability recovery for 2H25E looks relatively optimistic, when comparing with mid- cycle margins, while top- line growth expectations have more than halved, from c. 18% early FY24 to c. 8% CAGR for FY24- FY28E today, mainly due to a slowdown in offshore wind, from 30% to 14%, leading to an increased reliance on cost savings. As a result, we still see downside risk to FY25E consensus estimates of up to 25%. Fugro expects 2H25E revenues will be c. 20% higher than 1H25, implying an 8% decrease y/y, supported by postponed orders, and increased customer confidence, underlined by recent large project wins, resulting in FY25E revenues of close to €2.0bn, down 13% y/y. As a result, Fugro expects a FY25E EBIT margin in the range of 8%- 11% (lowered from 11%- 15% on August 1st), implying a 2H25E EBIT margin of 13%- 18%, vs. the record level of 14.4% in 2H24. The margin target is expected to be supported by targeted cost savings of €80m- €100m, adding c. 4% points to margins, with half of savings related to a headcount reduction of c. 750 FTEs (7% of the workforce). We have cut FY25E EBIT by 25% to €132.1m, assuming a 10.4% mid- cycle EBIT margin for 2H25E, below the record- high level of 14.4% in 2H24, as cost savings and profitability from now projects will likely be back- end loaded. Beyond FY25E, we are projecting high- single digit annual revenue growth to €2.7bn by FY29E, and a 200bps higher EBIT margin at 11.0% by FY29E, vs. the 11%- 15% target range for FY27E. Fugro shares are down 27% ytd, vs. EuroStoxx up 10%, and trading at 9.5x FY26E EV/EBIT, implying a 25% premium to peers. Our lowered €10.0 DCF- based PT values Fugro at 8.0x FY26E EV/EBIT.",
