Battery equipment revenue grew \\(16\\%\\) y- y to CNY4.5bn in 1H25, contributing \\(69\\%\\) to the total revenue. GPM contracted by 2.5pp y- y to \\(33.8\\%\\) in 1H (2Q25: down 2.6pp y- y or 1.5pp q- q to \\(33.1\\%\\) ), likely owing to a shift in the revenue mix with increased contribution from low- margin domestic orders during 2023- 24. With effective cost control, the company's opex ratio improved by 3.0pp y- y to \\(24.5\\%\\) in 1H. Lead reported a \\(61\\%\\) y- y earnings growth to CNY740mn, translating into a 2Q25 earnings of CNY375mn (vs net loss of CNY105mn in 2Q24, or \\(+3\\%\\) q- q growth).",

Management indicated that the contract- winning for FY25E is likely to exceed previous guidance of CNY23bn \\((+30\\%\\) y- y), primarily driven by robust demand from domestic battery cell makers. Furthermore, management highlighted incremental orders worth CNY400- 500mn for all- solid- state battery (ASSB) equipment in 1H25, compared with only - CNY100mn in FY24. We expect Lead's order momentum for ASSB equipment to continue in 2H25- FY26F, based on major battery cell makers' expectation of small- scale ASSB commercialization by FY27F. According to Lead, the company has already made shipment of 600Mpa isostatic pressing equipment, the core equipment for ASSB production lines, to customers in 1H25.",

We cut our FY25- 26F GPM forecasts by 1.0- 2.4pp due to changes in the sales mix. We cut our FY25- 26F opex ratio forecasts by 2.5- 3.9pp owing to continued cost reduction efforts. As a result, we cut our FY25F earnings by \\(11\\%\\) , while we lift our FY26F earnings by \\(1\\%\\) . We upgrade Lead from Neutral to Buy, with TP lifted to CNY41, from CNY16), based on 29x (previously 13x) FY26F EPS of CNY1.41. Our targeted multiple is equivalent to 0.5x (previously 2x) SD below the historical average, as we believe: 1) the battery industry demand is recovering from the trough and 2) there has been incremental contribution from the ASSB segment.
