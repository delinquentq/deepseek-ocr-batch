Key takeaways include 1) NIM reached Rmb 8bn (+27%/+2% yoy/qoq and +9% vs. GSe), outperforming on robust IEA growth of 17% (+2ppts ahead of GSe) and better- than- expected GS calculated NIM of 1.12% (+10/4bps yoy/qoq and +9bps vs. GSe). 2) Non- NII missed expectations with fee income down -8% yoy in 2Q25 (compared to +18% yoy in 1Q25) likely due to front- loaded effect given overall strong agency sales and investment banking revenue growth in 1H25 (+21%/+46% yoy), and investment income growth of -6% yoy due to high base, despite rapid investment securities expansion of 19% yoy. 3) Provisions came in at Rmb 2.4bn, up +10% yoy and +14% above GSe. However, with NPL ratio slightly edging up to 0.84% (+1bps qoq) and NPL formation rate remaining elevated at 1.1% (-1bp qoq), NPL coverage ratio declined to 312% (-33/-12ppts yoy/qoq and -7ppts vs. GSe), pointing to lingering asset quality pressure, particularly in retail. 4) CET1 ratio rose to 9.5% (+58bps qoq) supported by efficient capital deployment (RWA density fell -2ppts qoq) and completed convertible bond conversion, despite short- term EPS dilution. 5) BONJ will continue the interim dividend payout though detailed plan is pending.",
