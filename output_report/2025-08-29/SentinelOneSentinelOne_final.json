      "text": "SentinelOne delivered substantially better than expected ARR, but lack of flow through to full year guidance leaves us cautious. SentinelOne's results for 2Q were better than expected as ARR rebounded with growth of \\(24\\%\\) y/y to over \\(\\) 1bn. Performance was supported by healthy logo adds as well as expansion with existing customers with increased adoption of SIEM, Purple AI, and CNAPP in addition to broader platform adoption. Purple AI traction was notable in particular, with greater than \\(30\\%\\) license attach rates in the quarter. The company also followed the lead of several of its Security peers with the launch of its SentinelOne Flex pricing model this quarter. In spite of much better traction across the platform for the quarter, full year revenue guidance was left relatively unchanged (increased by just \\(\\) 2\\mathrm{mm}$ at the bottom end and \\(\\) 1\\mathrm{mm}$ at the top vs a \\(\\sim\\) 1bn run rate), which will likely give investors pause considering the degree of implied conservatism that remains embedded in the outlook. The announced acquisition of Prompt in the quarter is expected to have an immaterial impact to revenue growth this year, but we think it will provide another point of scrutiny with regard to lack of upward guidance revision. Operating margin of just over \\(2\\%\\) was slightly better than expected for the quarter while operating margin guidance for the full year was trimmed to account for an expected 80bp headwind attributable to the Prompt deal. SentinelOne is still one of the faster- growing vendors within our coverage universe, but it also remains at an earlier stage of inflection toward profitability and FCF, which we expect will translate into less fundamental valuation support nearterm. We continue to see potential for growth to reaccelerate but we think the company will need to string together several quarters of consistently better execution, following recent quarters of disappointment, in order to be rewarded with a better multiple. We remain Neutral rated as we update our estimates for current period results and outlook.",
