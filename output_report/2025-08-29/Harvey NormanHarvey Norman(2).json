The focus is on the LFL sales momentum through 2H25 and into the July trading update in Australia (+5.3% in 1H25 to +6.6% in 2H25 and +6.4% in July) and NZ (- 2.5% in 1H25 to +4.7% in 2H25 and +7.2% in July). Off a low base in recent years, Harvey Norman is finally seeing leverage to an improving cycle. The fixed- cost nature of the franchised model in Australia leads to high levels of operating leverage at earnings, which presents upside to consensus in FY26 given improving sales growth.",

Harvey Norman has seen Australian LFL sales momentum accelerate from +5.3% in 1H25 to +6.6% in 2H25 and +6.4% in July. This compares to our forecasts of 4.5% in 2H25 and 4.0% in 1H26. The fixed- cost nature of the franchised model in Australia leads to high levels of operating leverage to sales at PBT. We forecast FY26 PBT growth of 14.4% from sales growth of 4.5%. 2) NZ has turned the corner. NZ sales have picked up markedly in response to large RBNZ rate cuts, from - 2.5% in 1H25 to +4.7% in 2H25 and +7.2% in July. This is the clearest sign yet through reporting season that NZ is seeing better trading conditions. 3) Inventory levels moderating. Receivables from franchisees moderated YoY, from \\(\\) 812m\\(13.4% of network sales) to\\) \\ \\(785m\\) (12.2% of network sales), indicating there is a healthy franchisee inventory position as at 30 June, supporting margins in 1H26.",
