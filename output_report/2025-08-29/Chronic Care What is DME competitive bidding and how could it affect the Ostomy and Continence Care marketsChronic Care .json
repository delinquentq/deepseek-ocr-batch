The draft rule proposes reclassifying certain medical equipment items including ostomy, tracheostomy, and urological supplies (i.e. catheters) so that they would be eligible for CMS's competitive bidding program (CBP). In the CBP, suppliers bid to provide products in selected product categories, and contracts are awarded based on price competitiveness. This dynamic typically creates a direct financial impact on retailers (i.e. distributors), who compete on price in order to secure specified volumes.

A similar case in 2019 involved over \\(\\) 1.2\\$ billion in fraudulent claims for orthotic braces, where telemarketing firms offered low- cost braces to Medicare beneficiaries, paid kickbacks to doctors for prescriptions without proper evaluations, and routed claims through DME suppliers for Medicare reimbursement. In response to such abuse, CMS has pointed to the effectiveness of the Competitive Bidding Program in reducing unnecessary (i.e. fraudulent) utilization, as noted in a 2016 Government Accountability Office report. For example, CMS reported that aligning Medicare payments for DME items with market- based prices has made CBP- covered items less attractive to suppliers engaged in fraudulent billing, thereby helping to reduce fraud and abuse in certain DME products.",

In Exhibit 2, we show a list of HCPCS codes for commonly used ostomy bags. Product selection is tailored to the patient's anatomy, lifestyle, and skin condition, rendering the role of post- acute training and patient support essential. For instance, Convatec has a patient support program called me+ and Coloplast offers Coloplast Care, that provide personalized support through digital tools and helplines to assist patients in managing their chronic condition with greater independence and confidence. Such services are especially important in the post- acute and home- care setting, where clinical oversight is often limited. However, these services are not separately reimbursed by CMS but are embedded in the product price. If pricing declines sharply, suppliers may be forced to scale back or eliminate these programs to protect margins.

The second channel consists of distributors who supply larger post- acute care facilities directly. Finally, DME dealers (i.e. retailers or suppliers) serve as the third channel, connecting manufacturers with smaller post- acute care providers and directly with patients. An example of one of the larger DME suppliers today is Lincare, which is the dealer business within Linde, a company best known in the healthcare market for supplying products for home oxygen therapy; as such, the DME categories that they focus on include oxygen therapy, sleep therapy, nebulizer therapy, and ventilator therapy.

This fee schedule establishes fixed reimbursement rates and maximum quantities allowed for thousands of medical device categories, typically on a monthly basis.

But while the immediate pressure of competitive bidding would fall on the retailer, the impact could work its way upstream. As dealers would likely bid below the previous retail price in order to secure contracted volumes, resulting in lower profitability, they typically would then lean on the product manufacturers to reduce the wholesale price to offset some of the retail margin compression. This dynamic could ultimately lead to pricing pressure on manufacturers, even for those with limited direct exposure to retail distribution channels.",
