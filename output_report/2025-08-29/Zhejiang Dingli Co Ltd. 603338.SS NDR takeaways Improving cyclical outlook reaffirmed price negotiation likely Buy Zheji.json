On the call, management highlighted CMEC's resilient US sales in 1H25 (flat yoy) despite US- China tariff escalation in April, robust growth in non- US/Europe markets (primarily EMs) and revived growth from small- to- medium- sized domestic rental customers. Into 2H, EU could also turn from a headwind into tailwind given the low base and gradual cyclically recovery. Dingli is currently bearing the additional tariff announced this year in the US but mentioned price negotiation for next year will likely happen towards the year- end once more clarity on US tariff comes out. We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged 12- m TP of Rmb64.0 after fine- tuning our earnings estimates post 2Q25 results.",
