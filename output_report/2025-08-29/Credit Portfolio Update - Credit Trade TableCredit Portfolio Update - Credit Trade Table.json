As a rule, JGBs for individual investors may not be sold in the first 12 months after issuance. When JGBs for individual investors are sold before maturity, an amount calculated via the following formula will be subtracted from the par value of the bond plus accrued interest: (1) for 10- year variable rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) x 0.79685 will be used, (2) for 5- year and 3- year fixed rate bonds, an amount equal to the two preceding coupon payments (before tax) x 0.79685 will be used. When inflation- indexed JGBs are purchased via public offerings, secondary distributions (uridashi deals), or other OTC transactions with Nomura Securities, only the purchase price shall be paid, with no sales commission charged. Inflation- indexed JGBs carry the risk of losses, as prices fluctuate in line with changes in market interest rates and fluctuations in the nationwide consumer price index. The notional principal of inflation- indexed JGBs changes in line with the rate of change in nationwide CPI inflation from the time of its issuance. The amount of the coupon payment is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate by the notional principal at the time of payment. The maturity value is the amount of the notional principal when the issue becomes due. For J117 and subsequent issues, the maturity value shall not undercut the face amount. Purchases of investment trusts (and sales of some investment trusts) are subject to a purchase or sales fee of up to \\(5.5\\%\\) (tax included) of the transaction amount. Also, a direct cost that may be incurred when selling investment trusts is a fee of up to \\(2.0\\%\\) of the unit price at the time of redemption.
