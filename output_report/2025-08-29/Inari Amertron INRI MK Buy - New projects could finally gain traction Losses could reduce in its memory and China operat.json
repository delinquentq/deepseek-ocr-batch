Management highlighted that FY25 was generally weaker y- y due to lower volume loadings in all business segments and less favorable forex (weaker average USD vs MYR). Profitability margins were also affected by its loss- making operations in Yiwu, China, which is averaging a MYR5mn loss per quarter.",

      "text": "Under its radio frequency (RF) segment, Inari is in the midst of ramping up production for upcoming launches of new iPhone models in Sept 2025. It has also started developing some new programs for 2026 models. According to management, the memory division's current run- rate is \\(\\sim 24k / day\\) and the unit is still loss- making. To address this, it aims to reach 40k/day upon material normalization from its customer. At the same time, it is in talks with several memory customers that could pave way for volume pick- up. On automotive, management unveils some testers from peers are being transferred over by its key customer, which could double its testing volume in the new few quarters. On the opto- electronics segment, management reveals demand for legacy products remains slow but it sees increased 800G orders from a key customer for data centers usage. It also expects demand for its opto- electronics for photonics application to quadruple in FY26E. Its Philippines site will commence production of power management modules in 1QCY26. On its loss- making Yiwu operations, the group is now in active discussions with several local customers on potential mass production. This, if materialises, could help turn around the plant financially. Management remains hopeful of the proposed acquisition of Lumileds (unlisted)(note) which could help bring in new opportunities and help accelerate the group's penetration in the advanced packaging space.",

We also introduce our FY28E forecasts. Rolling forward our valuation base to CY26F at an unchanged 30x P/E (+1SD), our TP now stands at MYR2.44. Given the appealing upside, we upgrade our call to Buy (from Neutral). The stock currently trades at 24.5x CY26F P/E. Key downside risks include USD/MYR fluctuations and US tariff uncertainty which could affect the demand for end- products.",
