The question marks surrounding Fed independence going forward will continue to run with the Cook saga and Miran's likely confirmation pre September FOMC, if the data plays ball it definitely feels like the market will try and trade a back to school dollar selloff, flow wise that was definitely the flavour yesterday. Long weekend in the States, plenty of likely non- market moving data today and of course month end it seems likely the hard to explain price action will remain for at least a couple more sessions.",

So whilst that particular aspect of domestic news doesn't look great, still feel overall that right now the US side is the driving force from here and things point to risk of a lower dollar, with interest having collapsed in recent weeks we head into a key period whereby there will surely be a chase on if the euro can begin to drift higher again. Previously at the highs there was concern at the wide gap to fair value models for the currency, it is interesting that our strategy see that gap having closed with the recent move in US real yields the primary driver and therefore another constraint for strength removed.",

      "text": "Hard to disentangle month end related gyrations at the moment from genuine price signal, clearly the fact that the USD could not rally far on the better GDP and solid claims would be encouraging but then again it is that time of the month. That is also true for sterling which struggled yesterday, we saw GBP supply from a good number of RM accounts (1.5z) which, along with the French spread narrowing, saw the cross rebound nicely for the week. News flow remains rubbish of course with article after article depicting growing angst in the Economy - this time from Banks as they worry they could get snared in the ever expanding tax net that is to be cast - although the same probably cannot be said of Angela Raynor. Keeping modest EURGBP longs here, would like to see price action remains positive after the rebalancing period ends. Levels painfully familiar; 0.86/0.87 in the cross, 1.34/1.36 in cable. US PCE later.",

Waller was on the wires overnight and while he said 25bp would be sufficient he did highlight the risks here for the labour market as the drop in demand is very worrying indeed and we should not really be comforted by the drop in supply. We have PCE today to get past but all focus will be pointing towards the labour market data next week, we have started to nibble at some short term JPY topside here and will likely build more in the coming sessions. Given the lack of positioning in the JPY it should remain bid into the NFP which will likely trigger some technical acceleration in the meantime; we closed on the 50d last night (147.00 today) while the cloud lurks below (146.72). Net flows remains minimal in our franchise but interest in certainly starting to pick up in the options space.",

I still think USDCHF should be lower on the back of Fed independence worries, and US catch down. Next week is an important week for the latter however, and will dictate what the Fed do in September. We also have month end to contend with, so lightened up the USDCHF shorts a little here into the long weekend. Flow wise we continue to see systematics buying CHF, marking 5 days in a row.",

AUDNZD was, however, taken off the highs as the desk saw decent supply of the cross from HFs. Whilst it's disappointing to see AUDNZD back below the 1.11 handle, the fundamental reasons for being long still hold, so keeping our sights on the YTD highs at 1.1175/80. RBNZ Chair Quigley resigned overnight, but given this is related to the bank's governance and not monetary policy, it shouldn't have an impact on the currency. Flow- wise, systematics were large buyers of AUD again, extending their buy streak to 5.",

We had turned more neutral as fair value in USDCAD sits closer to 1.35/36, but not sure I want to chase lower given some of this move could be month end related. We also have important US data next week, that should dictate the direction of the dollar. GDP data today out of Canada to keep an eye on although not sure it will move the needle hugely. In terms of levels, USDCAD sits neatly between the 100 and 50 day at 1.3770/1.3735, but 1.36 acts as major support.",

Swedish fiscal policy was more expansionary than expected at \\(1.2\\%\\) vs GDE we had forecasts of \\(0.9\\%\\) , which is promising for an economy that has been disappointing recently. Furthermore, we saw an improvement in GDP this morning, starting to show some green shoots of growth. Whilst these prints are still below the very optimistic Riksbank forecasts, the turnaround in data and increase in fiscal spend should be a positive for the currency going forward. Meanwhile in Norway whilst data still looks strong (retail sales and low unemployment rate this AM), headlines from Senator Graham suggesting tariffs on Norway due to the wealth funds divestment from holdings of Caterpillar were the focus yesterday. EURNOK did trade with a bid tone post the headlines, and whilst tariffs would be a negative, I put it more down to noise for the time being. I had been favoring NOKSEK, but after the Swedish fiscal news the facts have changed and think selling EURSEK on a rally towards 11.17 makes sense. The pair sits at support at the 100 day at 11.0593 so watching to see if we can break this level.",
