Despite LITE being up 50%+ YTD, we continue to see further upside in the stock and prefer LITE to COHR over the next 12-months as we expect LITE to be more agnostic to the AI optics technology changes and module share dynamics. We see LITE being well on track to outpace both company and Street's longer-term expectations with the ramp of its industry leading EML and its new AI products in emerging markets such as OCS and CPO. We subsequently model a +8%/+10% sales and EPS upside in FY2027E (Jun-2027) and value LITE at $165 or 23x P/E applied to our FY2027E earnings power of $7. Our 23x P/E multiple is at a 21% premium to the 19x average P/E of AI optics peers which we view as justified on an earnings growth adjusted basis.",

Lumentum previously highlighted leading on the higher port count front where 2 out of their 3 wins are in. In terms of future opportunities, 5/7 of the company's opportunities are also higher port count. The primary benefits Lumentum has vs competition in higher port count are at a power level, ultra- wideband level (MEMS unlike liquid crystal- based operates seamlessly across the O, C and L optical bands), as well stability and reliability levels. One of the two wins Lumentum has in OCS is with a customer (we think GOOGL) that has an in- house option. However, Lumentum's view is that its OCS switch is cheaper and better performing vs that customer's in- house solution. With that, the company expects to take significant share vs the in- house solution. Additionally, LITE indicates that it is unlikely that this customer will continue with the in- house option. LITE also benefits from the rapidity of its manufacturing when it comes to OCS which would be crucial as the technology ramps. This combined with their technological advantage at higher port count likely drove a second hyperscalers (likely AMZN) to use them as sole source. The third win is at a lower port count \\(64 \\times 64\\). This area is more competitive with companies such as COHR having a viable alternative, but LITE discussed being able to also win in that area due to its lower return loss (or high pass through which reflects how easily light can go by without being reflected). Similar to LITE's management, we estimate that when it comes to greenfield opportunities in AI data centers (particularly for large training clusters), OCS should be a viable alternative to packet switches as the OCS switches provide cost, power saving and improved latency. Additionally, OCS switches are data- rate agnostic, allowing them to support 400G, 800G and soon 1.6T without the need for upgrade. We expect LITE's OCS sales to be \\(\\) 100M+\\(quarterly by FY2028E as the company builds on its three key customers.",

SiPho is a cutting- edge technology that integrates optical functions, such as the generation, manipulation, and detection of light, directly onto silicon- based semiconductor platform. It leverages the unique properties of photon particles of light to transmit and process information. Because it is a technology build on the widely used silicon material, its future integration with electronic components is also built on silicon. This compatibility not only simplifies production but also makes SiPho solutions often more cost- effective ones. Another advantage of SiPho is that it has the potential for higher data transmission rates and can typically travel further distance with less signal loss compared to the traditional electronic signals. SiPho can be used in a pluggable form or in a system form (switch or XPUs) via what is called optical engines. In terms of components a SiPho chip often has the following components:",

In fact, we believe that training will significantly drive the DCI opportunity starting with ZR/ZR+ optical products. Lastly, as more AI training platforms continue to extend to a larger and larger number of data centers, we don't rule out what used to be networking systems (Routers, ROADMs among others) used primarily by traditional telco companies, also seeing a strong ramp driven by a relatively nascent hyperscalers demand for long- range networking equipment systems for AI.",

At that time when the company was making capacity decisions in terms of both equipment and process node changes (from 3 to 4 inch), it was based on market data, supply chain checks and the feedback LITE was getting from their customers which they have strong visibility with. As they look to the next 2- 3 years, the company is making similar steps in order to figure out the right capacity investments to make now. Additionally, over the past quarters, the company has added more flexibility to its manufacturing. Beforehand, the company put most of their bets in internal manufacturing but with the new management coming on broad he has adopted a more flexible/hybrid manufacturing model (70% internal and 30% external with companies such as Fabrinet and other suppliers in Malaysia). This model allows the company to ramp or pull- down capacity as needed. In addition to outside manufacturers like Fabrinet, LITE has two module fabs in China and Thailand. In terms of the laser, LITE has 4 InP fabs with two driving the bulk of the activity. Two are in Japan allowing the company to modulate production depending on how much capacity is needed. The \\(3^{\\text{rd}}\\) major fab is located in California, the fourth is in UK and is quite underutilized on purpose as it is used only in the case of excess demand.",

The company aims to go fully internal in 1HC2026. Still on CW lasers the company also sells its products externally and saw marginal sales mix of CW lasers this quarter. The downside of a faster pivot to CW laser would be a less accretive margin profile than it is the case for EML, though both are above company- level margins.

Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

      "text": "Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near- term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds \\(15\\%\\) against the direction of the call (unless over- ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer- term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings- distribution- disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share- price movement will not materialize as expected.",

The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies.

For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product.
