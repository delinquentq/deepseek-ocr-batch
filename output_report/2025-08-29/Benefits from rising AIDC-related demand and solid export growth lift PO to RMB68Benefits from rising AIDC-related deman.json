The AI infra chain has rallied over the past few months, driven by the capex raise from domestic and US ISPs and CSPs. Jinpan saw \\(461\\%\\) YoY revenue growth from data centers in 1H25 and completed the SST sample recently. We estimate its \\(0 / 0\\) of earnings from data centers to reach \\(20\\%\\) in 2026 ( \\(7\\%\\) in 2024). Meanwhile, the largely eased concern about US- China tariff and launch of its Malaysia factory could also help support its US orders (export revenue \\(+11\\%\\) YoY in 1H25). We raise our 2025- 27E EPS by \\(5 - 25\\%\\) on higher revenue and margin estimates. We switch our valuation methodology to SOTP (from P/E) given the rising \\(0 / 0\\) of earnings from AIDC. We assign \\(68x\\) P/E to AIDC segment and \\(22x\\) P/E to non- AIDC segment (in line with that for power equipment peers). As such, we raise our PO to RMB68 (from RMB37). The implied blended P/E is \\(31x\\) ( \\(23x\\) previously), 0.55D above the historical average level to reflect the upcycle of the AI infra chain. We reiterate Buy.",
