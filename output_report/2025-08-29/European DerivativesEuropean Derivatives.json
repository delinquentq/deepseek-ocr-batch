We agree that a September cut is not on the cards but we believe that a cut in October is a possibility even though market pricing of such a move is minimal. Our baseline is for ECB to deliver one final cut in October, although the bar for an ease is high. Recent media articles have mentioned that ECB sources see rates remaining on hold in September given growth has surprised to the upside, the EU- US trade deal is not causing \"major economic concerns\", and inflation data are in line with the June forecast (Figure 4).",

While the upside to receiving is limited, we believe that this offers asymmetric upside from current levels, as the ESTR curve is only pricing a cumulative easing of around 20bp by mid- 2026. With the ECB still maintaining an easing bias, we believe that the market will continue to price some easing which is likely to increase if output were to start to weaken or inflation prints over the coming months are more benign than ECB's forecast.

For instance, Dutch pension funds typically announce indexation of pension payouts based on the September inflation print. With Dutch inflation still above \\(2\\%\\) , we expect these funds to announce further increase in payouts this year. Historically, these funds then typically receive in long- end swaps (a 10s/30s flattener) to lock coverage ratios. A repeat of this dynamic could exert some flattening pressure on the curve. Of course, there exists a nontrivial chance that, due to already high policy funding ratios and high interest rate hedge exposures, indexation- based receiving could be smaller than seen previously. Nevertheless, this remains a risk to medium- term steepeners. Empirically, the 10s/30s curve tends to flatten a few bps over the month of September (Figure 12).",

Nevertheless, in the event of a large widening of French spreads, we would expect German swap spreads to widen as well, despite limited correlation currently. In Figure 17, we show the betas of various German swap spreads versus 10Y OAT/Bund spreads during past episodes of sharp widening in French spreads. While the relationship is currently broadly non-existent, historically, German swap spreads tend to exhibit a decent beta (and R-squared) to French spreads during these two episodes. For instance, Schatz spreads moved with a beta of around 50% to French spreads during the sharp widening seen in June 2024 when Macron surprisingly announced the parliamentary elections. Admittedly, the reaction of German swap spreads this time around has been rather muted but we believe that Schatz swap spread widener still offers a good hedge against a tail risk of significant widening in French spreads.",

Issuance activity this time around is broadly following historical patterns and we expect this to continue increasing over the coming weeks; we also show the typical monthly averages of these swapped issuance activity across the calendar year versus that seen in 2025. All else equal, this increase in swapped issuance activity over the coming weeks should exert a narrowing pressure on intermediate swap spreads. However, as we have discussed at length before, pre- positioning in anticipation of these flows tends to lead to narrower spreads already before issuance picks up. Bund spreads typically exhibit some volatility around end- August/September while maintaining the overall broad narrowing trend (Figure 21). While this is supportive of a modest narrowing bias, we refrain from outright positioning given lingering risks around French politics and also going into US payroll data next week (see above).",

However, we continue to stay short volatility, especially via structures that exploit mean reversion in front- end yields (Figure 26). Admittedly, we have a bullish duration bias (see above) but we highlight that we do not expect front- end yields to decline materially from current levels and range trading remains a strong conviction theme. The bar for ECB to cut policy rates further is high and it will require proof of data which is likely to be gradual over the coming weeks, as is reflected in our baseline scenario of a final cut coming only in October. In other words, even though implied volatility is likely to remain sticky, we do expect delivered volatility to stay muted over the coming weeks.

The weighted implied volatility spread (weighted by vega to obtain equi- notional exposure) exhibits a strong positive correlation to implieds but with a small beta (Figure 28). The weighted vol spread is close to the low end of its recent range and appears marginally too cheap versus implies. On the curve, we prefer these structures in the 5Y sector where we expect delivered volatility to be relatively muted as ECB is expected to remain on the sidelines over the next few weeks. The main risk to this trade would come from a jump in risk- off sentiment which could lead to some flattening of the expiry curve and/or large yield moves.
