We expect \\(1\\%\\) growth, and \\(3.7\\%\\) for inflation. The governor described the different phases of the easing cycle, underscoring that the MPC is now in a third stage of cuts, changing gears from 'calibration (i.e. 50bps clips)' towards a new gradual phase.",

DG Mejia echoed the same message and underscored that there is still space to continue with the easing cycle in the context of the ongoing inflation dynamics and the restrictive policy stance. DG Borja validated the importance of changing gears to 50bps cuts early in the year; yet she was a bit more prudent, emphasizing the need to ensure inflation convergence. Unsurprisingly, DG Heath (the hawkish dissenter in the last couple of meetings) raised concerns on food inflation and its knock- on effects on core services. Finally, on growth, DG Heath stated that despite recent positive surprises, the economy remains stalled.",
