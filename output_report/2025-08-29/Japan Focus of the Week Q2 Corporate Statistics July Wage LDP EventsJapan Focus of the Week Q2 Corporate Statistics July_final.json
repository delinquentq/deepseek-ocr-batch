Secretary- General Hiroshi Moriyama has previously stated that he will explain his responsibility based on the election review, and we think attention will be focused on Mr. Moriyama's next move, as he has been a key supporter of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishida. Based on the election review report, the LDP will begin procedures for holding an early party presidential election. Such an election requires requests from a majority (172) of the total number of 295 LDP Diet members and 47 prefectural chapters. Diet members who wish to request an election must submit their request in writing to the LDP headquarters during a five- to seven- day confirmation period following the September 2 joint plenary meeting (prefectural chapters can submit their requests by mail). The timing of the decision on whether to hold an election is unclear, but according to some media (NHK, August 28, etc.), the result is expected to be announced on September 8. The LDP Election Committee has decided to announce the names of Diet members who request an election. If a majority of Diet members request an early election, and an election is to be held, the voting day is likely to be at the end of September or later.",
