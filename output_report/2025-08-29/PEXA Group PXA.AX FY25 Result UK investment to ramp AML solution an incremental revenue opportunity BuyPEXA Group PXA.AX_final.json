Despite this investment and ongoing cybersecurity and automation initiatives, management reiterated FY26 Exchange EBITDA margins will remain at current levels (c.55%); (2) Natwest monetisation is on track for 2H26, starting with existing remo completions processed through Optima (c.8% of volumes) and will accelerate in FY27+; and (3) Engagement with lenders and conveyancers (national roadshow in Sep- 25) remains strong post Natwest, and following the BoE's system upgrade, testing is now only required after formal commitment is received from lenders, providing greater flexibility around testing windows. Key negatives: (1) FY26 UK cash outflow increasing to - \\(59 - 63mn\\) (GSe - \\(63mn, FY25 - 58mn\\) ) given a step up in sales/marketing, with cost growth likely to remain ahead of revenue growth in FY27; (2) FY26 group revenue and EBITDA guidance was softer vs. VAE despite improving property market conditions as a result of the rate cutting cycle. Guidance on significant items has also been excluded but may still arise in FY26 pending the outcome of its Digital strategic review; and (3) Exchange pricing review continues to create uncertainty from FY27+ given potential changes to CPI- linked pricing.",
