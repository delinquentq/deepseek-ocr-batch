      "text": "This week in Business & Information Services, we published takeaways from our non- deal roadshow with MCO, where we came away more positive on the company's Gen AI strategy, which has evolved to developing agentic solutions for clients in the MA segment, building out MCP servers to interface with external LLMs and leveraging LLMs for edge workflows in MIS not involving a ratings action. Based on our conversations, investor feedback on MCO was positive given its proactive Gen AI strategy that can drive incremental revenue. We also published highlights from our NDR with MH that provided new insights on its digital transformation, strong K- 12 capture rates so far this year and positive growth outlook beyond F2026. Investor sentiment on MH was mixed, with some investors uncertain over the potential impact of Gen AI on the business and others citing upside potential to F2026 revenue and a forthcoming recovery in F2027. This week, we reviewed top takeaways from the 2Q earnings cycle, as well, and noted the intensified debate around whether Gen AI could disrupt certain companies in Business Services, most notably IT. Investor feedback on IT was cautiously optimistic, with a number highlighting early 2026 as when the stock could recover if CV growth reaccelerates. We additionally analyzed the latest consumer credit trends through July and found ongoing improvements in delinquency rates and healthy growth in personal loan originations.",

US consumer credit continued to exhibit improving trends in July despite ongoing macro uncertainty. Non-mortgage delinquencies declined across multiple categories, with \\(60+\\) day card delinquencies down 15 bps y/y to \\(2.76\\%\\) and personal loan delinquencies down 27 bps to \\(3.25\\%\\) , mitigated by auto loan delinquencies rising 2 bps to \\(1.51\\%\\) in July. Delinquency trends have been broadly declining y/y for cards since January 2025 and personal loans since November 2024, with auto loan delinquencies flat- to- up y/y over the past six months. Meanwhile, new account originations were flat y/y for cards, down modestly for autos after tariff- related pull- forward activity earlier this year and up double- digits for personal loans driven by fintech activity. We favor Buy- rated Fair Isaac for its wide competitive moat and pricing power in the Scores business, which we believe remain intact even after the FHFAs lender choice decision, and for its idiosyncratic platform transformation in the Software business. We stay Neutral- rated on Equifax given state budget, white collar staffing and criminal background screening share shift headwinds in the EWS business, and are sidelined on TransUnion in the context of lending volumes coming below historical averages among the company's fintech and small & regional bank customers.

The 2Q earnings cycle in Business & Information Services was characterized by an intensified debate over whether Gen AI could negatively disrupt certain companies in the sector. Gartner's 2Q results, which involved a miss- and- cut, ignited investor concerns that Gen AI could replace the company's IT research and insights, sending shares \\(28\\%\\) lower as contract value growth decelerated in the quarter and was guided by management to decelerate further in the second half of the year. Gen AI concerns at Gartner spilled over to other names in the space, including CSGP, FDS, RELGB and WKLNL. Based on takeaways from our recent 2nd annual Silicon Valley AI Field Trip, we believe sustainable moats in Business & Info Services capable of protecting from Gen AI competition include strong user sociology, i.e., having distributed users, power users and embedded workflows that make the product sticky, and proprietary data that cannot be replicated or produced by LLMs. We see Gartner - down \\(49\\%\\) YTD - as oversold given its research and insights are proprietary and cannot be reliably or closely substituted by LLMs. We also believe SPGI is favorably leveraged to Gen AI given assistant and agentic capabilities being incorporated into its products, and its proprietary data. IRM's data center business should additionally benefit from rising Gen AI infrastructure capex to support growing inference needs as enterprise adoption of Gen AI increases.

We recently hosted a non- deal roadshow with Moody's Cristina Pieretti (General Manager of Digital Content & Innovation) and Shivani Kak (Head of Investor Relations), and came away more confident in the company's Gen AI strategy and its ability to unlock customer value. MCO has evolved from deploying Gen AI through its Research Assistant to developing agentic solutions that can automate full workflows, such as drafting credit memos and conducting SWOT analysis. Management highlighted a key competitive advantage is its proprietary data, including ratings and research, as well as its curated public data that has been enhanced with tagging and metadata. The company has built MCP servers to interface its data with external LLMs, accessible only to paying clients; MCO does not sell or license data for model training or non- client use. MCO monetizes its Gen AI products by considering client efficiencies gained and labor costs displaced, with strict metering to ensure the pass- through of LLM costs. Gen AI is being deployed primarily in MCO's MA segment, with limited use in MIS for edge tasks such as flagging potential rating triggers and news retrieval, but not for any ratings actions. Management also emphasized the long- term opportunity in private credit, supported by Gen AI infrastructure build- out, while reaffirming its commitment to ratings integrity. Restructuring in MA is driving both reinvestments into Gen AI and margin expansion. Link to our 8/25 note here.",

In the CY2Q earnings cycle, investors were focused on how Business Services companies could have been disrupted by, or benefited from, growing enterprise adoption of Gen AI. Gartner represented a pivotal moment this past earnings cycle, with the share price declining \\(28\\%\\) in response to miss- and- cut results that investors attributed, at least in part, to Gen AI disintermediation, in contrast with management's explanation that the deceleration in Insights CV growth was due to reduced federal government spending and tariff impacts. Investor concerns over Gen AI also surfaced in quarterly results at HRB (down \\(5\\%\\) ) and RHI (down \\(6\\%\\) ), with spillover effects at CSGP, FDS and several European Business Services names including RELGB and WKLNL. Other Business Services companies that underperformed with 2Q results missed on KPIs (KLC - \\(19\\%\\) , IRM - \\(6\\%\\) , HRB - \\(5\\%\\) , CLVT - \\(4\\%\\) ), had outright revenue declines due to execution factors (BV - \\(6\\%\\) , VSTS - \\(6\\%\\) ), did not meet investor expectations for a guidance raise (ULS - \\(12\\%\\) , TRI - \\(10\\%\\) , VRSK - \\(6\\%\\) ) or exhibited negative cyclical exposures (MSCI - \\(9\\%\\) , EFX - \\(8\\%\\) , RHI - \\(6\\%\\) ).

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
