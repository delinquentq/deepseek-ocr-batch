The emerging Industries PMI stayed roughly unchanged in August after seasonal adjustment. However, high-frequency indicators such as steel production ticked up marginally in August. We expect the RatingDog manufacturing PMI (formerly the Caixin manufacturing PMI) to increase to 50.0 in August from 49.5 in July on a slight increase in export growth momentum as suggested by high-frequency shipping data. We expect the NBS nonmanufacturing PMI to rise to 50.3 in August from 50.1 in July. Services PMI should increase on improvement in the financial services sector. Adverse weather conditions likely continued to disrupt construction activity in August.",
