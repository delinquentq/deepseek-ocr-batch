The stock is indicated \\(+18\\%\\) AH as Elastic delivered total revenue of \\(\\) 415m\\(up 20%YoY (18% CC) and - 5% beat vs. Cons. (its largest revenue beat in the past 12 quarters), and raised the FY26 Revenue guidance at the mid- point by \\(\\sim\\) 55mn excluding the quarterly beat. Profitability metrics were solid as non- GAAP OpM came in at \\(\\sim 16\\%\\) \\((+410bps vs. Cons.), and adjusted FCFM of 28\\%\\) , reflecting operating leverage and cost efficiencies. Subscription revenue excluding Monthly Cloud accelerated to 22% YoY, underscoring sales segmentation progress and Large customers (ACV \\(>\\) 100k) rose to \\(\\sim 1,550\\) , adding \\(\\sim 180\\) net new over the past year, remaining flat sequentially versus the prior quarter and F1Q25. Elastic continues to show expanding GenAI demand, with over 2,200 Elastic Cloud customers leveraging the platform for RAG and vector- search use cases and \\(330+\\) customers spending \\(\\) 100k+, highlighting continued momentum in AI use- cases and Elastic's move upmarket. Product and competitive momentum was evident, with management citing Security and Observability displacements, serverless traction, and performance gains from recent engineering investments. While these results and the notable beat validate Elastic's platform positioning and go- to- market execution, we retain Neutral pending clearer, proof that the company can sustain this cadence through tougher comps and materially expand its base of up- market customers to underwrite a durable growth re- acceleration, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) will watch large- deal conversion, renewal dynamics, and product monetization closely.",

Elastic's combination of powerful and extensive technology and differentiated customer approach has the potential to disrupt a fragmented \\(\\sim \\$ 50bn+\\) IT Operations and Observability market. However, while the company's view is that buying centers in IT Operations are consolidating from best- of- breed solutions across APM, Logging, SIEM, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Search to full- stack Observability platforms, we are less certain and select large incumbent specialists such as Datadog in monitoring, Dynatrace in APM and Splunk in multiple domains to remain well entrenched. Still, we appreciate the uniqueness of Elastic's open- source legacy, its large base within the developer community, efficient product- led go- to- market motion, foundation as the dominant Enterprise Search solution, investments in a cloud model, and expansion into adjacent markets, and believe the company's value proposition will continue to rise within IT departments.",

Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
