The company also reiterated FY26 guidance. Key takeaways from the quarter include: 1) Management noted that given the momentum in the business, they are trending towards the high end of their FY26 sales guidance for Q3 (-1% to 1%), 2) vendor partnerships were a key driver of growth in the quarter, and 3) the company launched its marketplace last week which expands Best Buy's product offering and will be a contributor to margin improvement over time. We reiterate our Buy rating based on improving demand fundamentals which should only get stronger as the company continues to execute on new strategies like marketplace and the housing market starts to recover.
