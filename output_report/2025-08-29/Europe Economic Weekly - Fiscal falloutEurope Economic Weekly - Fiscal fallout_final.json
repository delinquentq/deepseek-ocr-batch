Europe&#x27;s labour market in unexpectedly good shape. Europe&#x27;s economy is resilient, not thriving. Tariffs may only have a small effect on GDP.Insurance cut&#x27; not needed with inflation at 2%. No reason to act before price, growth risks materialise. Inflation is &quot;for now in a good place&quot;. Will retain full freedom of action at each meeting.Nagel (22 August)Lagarde (20 August)The bar for further cuts is high. Do not see many arguments for more easing. Inflation is not [of concern] anymore.Recent trade deals have alleviated, but certainly not eliminated, global uncertainty, which persists on account of the unpredictable policy environment.Nagel (12 August)Holzmann (6 August)We can react flexibly if necessary. Tariff uncertainty lower but not fully removed. Inflation no longer a major challenge. Interest rates are at a very good level.No reason to cut interest rates again.",

Need to lean against second-round inflation effects. Approaching 2% to 4% neutral rate range. Little bit further to go on rates.Terminal rate estimates a broad range, no collective MPC view on terminal rate. QT impact on term premia up vs last estimate.
