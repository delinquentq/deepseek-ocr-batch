      "text": "Sagax's acquisition of a 10.8% stake in Retail Estates NV is a surprising strategic move given its core focus on logistics properties, whereas Retail Estates specializes in retail parks/assets that are more exposed to consumer trends and less aligned with Sagax's traditional investment strategy. This divergence raises questions about Sagax's long-term intentions, particularly the possibility of launching a full takeover bid. However, such a move would be financially tight considering Sagax's current leverage. A share swap deal could be a viable alternative, especially given the NAV premium, but it would likely result in dilution of David Mindus's stake, which could be a significant deterrent. At an implied yield of c.3.5%, using an equity content would be an interesting lever for Sagax but again without removing question marks on the rationale of this deal.",
