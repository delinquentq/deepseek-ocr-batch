While corporate lending has been driven by the power, wholesale/retail trade, and manufacturing sectors, up +26%/+20%/+18% YoY in 1H25, retail lending has focused on other retail loans/mortgage/personal business loans, up +7%/+5%/+4% YoY in 1H25. As deposit growth (+1.1% QoQ / +8.5% YoY in 2Q25) outpaced loan book growth of +0.2% QoQ in 2Q25, LDR fell -0.65ppt QoQ to 74.8% in 2Q25. **Asset quality:** NPL ratio fell 1bp QoQ to 0.93% in 2Q25, thanks to notably reduced corporate NPL ratio down -14bp HoH to 0.93% in 1H25 (driven by lower NPL ratio across most sectors), helping offset the negative from modest retail NPL ratio increase by +6bp HoH to 1.03% in 1H25 (due to higher retail NPL ratio in other retail loans / micro finance loans, up +32bp / +16bp HoH to 1.46%/0.95% in 1H25, offsetting the mortgage NPL ratio decline by -2bp HoH to 0.46% in 1H25). After adding back write-offs, gross NPL formation was broadly stable at 0.62% (flat QoQ) in 2Q25. Meanwhile, SML ratio fell 20bp QoQ to 1.17% in 2Q25. Amid decent asset-quality trend in 2Q25, CMB modestly reduced credit cost to 66bp in 2Q25 (-7bp QoQ / -8bp YoY), while still keeping its NPL coverage ratio steady at 410.9% in 2Q25 (+0.9ppt QoQ).

Retail asset quality pressure appears more manageable than expected, possibly due to CMB's more established retail franchise, serving the more prime/higher- quality retail customer segments vs. other China banks—e.g., CMB's mortgage NPL ratio has remained on a downtrend, - 2bp HoH to \\(0.46\\%\\) in 1H25, while most other covered China banks have seen mortgage NPL ratio uptick HoH in 1H25. This has likely helped create room for provision release, helping boost CMB's 1H25 earnings growth back to positive territory (+0.3% YoY in 1H25). We will seek more details at CMB's analyst briefing at 9:30 a.m. on 1 September 2025.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"-\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",
