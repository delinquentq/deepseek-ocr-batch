We are also focusing on the company's IP strategy aimed at increasing licensing revenues and sales of compact all-solid-state batteries, which have high heat resistance and long lifespans. We obtain our target price of ¥2,800 by multiplying our 27/3 EPS forecast of ¥183 by a P/E of 15-16x, still a roughly 10% discount versus the benchmark to reflect the increased volatility risk in some businesses, including semiconductor-related operations.

Sales of micro primary batteries such as heat-resistant CR batteries, coin-type CR batteries, and silver oxide batteries have been strong, and we expect sales of these batteries for automotive and medical equipment applications to continue to grow from Q2 onwards. We expect the energy segment as a whole to generate full-year operating profit growth in 26/3 despite the withdrawal from prismatic Li-ion batteries and higher development costs for all-solid-state batteries. We also revise our earnings forecasts for 27/3 onwards to factor in the acquisition of the micro primary battery business of Murata Manufacturing [6981], with which it signed a share transfer agreement on 16 June (scheduled for completion in 26/3).",
