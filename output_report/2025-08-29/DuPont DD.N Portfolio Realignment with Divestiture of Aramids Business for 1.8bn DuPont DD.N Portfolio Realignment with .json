      "text": "Today, DD announced a definitive agreement to divest its Aramids business, which includes the Kevlar and Nomex brands, to Arclin for a total consideration of \\(\\sim\\) 1.8bn. At transaction close, DD will receive pre- tax cash proceeds of \\(\\sim\\) 1.2bn, a \\(\\sim\\) 300mn note receivable, and \\(\\sim\\) 325mn non- controlling common equity interest in the future Arclin company, representing an \\(\\sim\\) 17.5% equity stake at close. Assuming sub- 20% (18- 20%) margins based on our discussions with DD and industry knowledge, the deal implies a 6.9- 7.7x EV/EBITDA multiple. While the multiple may seem underwhelming at first glance, we are not surprised given the margin and growth profile of the business. The divestiture strengthens DD's balance sheet flexibility and accelerates RemainCo's shift toward high- growth, high- margin businesses such as Water and Healthcare, in our view. Retaining an equity stake also ensures ongoing exposure to the Aramids business, offering optionality on future upside while supporting continued portfolio optimization.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \" -\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.
