It currently has a low- single- digit percentage share in the global smartwatch market, and \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) market share in sports and outdoor- related smartwatches. (2) Zepp has strong bargaining power and comprehensive development capabilities (including hardware, software, and algorithm), and thus lower costs and better app user experience compared with overseas competitors. Channel and marketing talent are also its advantages. (3) Zepp said its third- generation self- developed RISC- V chip offers cost savings. It is no longer a smart- band ODM to Xiaomi as of this year, and Xiaomi now has \\(15\\%\\) stake in ZEPP, and Xiaomi's CFO is a board member. We believe ZEPP is a strategic investment to Xiaomi and that its recent share rally of over 1,300% since July will contribute to a fair value gain for Xiaomi.",

To secure long- term growth, Zepp started to build its own brand several years ago, and it now operates three main product lines: 1) the entry- level series priced under Rmb1,000, competing with Xiaomi and white- label products; 2) the mid- range series between Rmb1,000 and Rmb2,000, positioned against Samsung and Apple SE watches; and 3) the premium series, benchmarked against Garmin. The company said its premium series offers user- friendly apps and its products are one- third Garmin's prices; it indicated that its heart rate response time could be further improved. A new running watch product line is slated for release, with optimistic growth projections for the coming year. Zepp also plans to launch a smart ring. Zepp currently has a low- single- digit share of the global smartwatch market (150- 170mm shipment a year). It estimates 20- 30mn sports and outdoor- related smartwatch shipment of which Garmin holds \\(\\sim 60\\%\\) share and Zepp \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) .",

Thus, Zepp says it has lower costs compared with overseas competitors. Zepp began channel development early with negotiations starting in 2019 with a key account. It took three years to establish a US offline retail presence. To support its branding efforts, Zepp has recruited key marketing talents from international sports brands and key smartwatch brands.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate.
