This week press coverage mooted National Insurance on landlord's 'unearned' income, Bank Taxes, lower allowances on primary residences for IHT and a landfill tax. Even mention of these potential taxes has a pernicious impact on confidence. Who would rush to buy a BTL property now?",

A thin buffer is damaging in itself - the coffers are always vulnerable. The article below argues the Chancellor may need to raise taxes even further in order to increase the buffer. A bigger buffer might help Gilt markets and boost economic confidence. The argument about addressing this hiatus is hard to contradict.. But the tax burden it entails may deliver a nasty shock. In that context the articles about Bank Taxes felt more credible. Perhaps the first of the 'difficult choices' facing the UK is which tax needs to rise to increase the buffer.",

Importantly, management highlighted that early indicators of the actions taken are positive and that it remains positive for business wins in the second half. Tariff- related price increases have also been implemented in 2Q, and Bunzl expects to see further increases in the remainder of the year. With FY25 guidance reiterated and Bunzl commenting that trading in July has been consistent with expectations for 2H, we expect limited changes to consensus at this point.
