      "text": "Robam's announced 1H25 results on 29 Aug, were broadly in line with the capital market's expectations. Interim revenue decreased \\(2.6\\%\\) y- y to CNY4.61bn in 1H25, and net margin dropped 0.6pp y- y to \\(15.4\\%\\) , leading to a \\(6.3\\%\\) y- y decline in interim earnings to CNY710mn. While Robam's revenue fell short of our expectations for 1H25F, the company's improved efficiency, through better supply chain management and tighter cost control, helped offset the topline weakness and reduced expense ratios, resulting in a better- than- expected operating margin/net margin of \\(17.4\\% /14.7\\%\\) (up 0.5/0.2pp y- y) in 2Q25. By product category, we noted traditional stove and wood base underperformed due to intensifying competition, while dishwashers, still at a low penetration rate, delivered strong growth with the help of government subsidies.",

On profitability, despite 2Q improvements from cost optimization and product mix, margins in 2H25F are likely to remain flattish y- y as external demand challenges persist. Over the longer term, we believe growth will hinge on Robam's ability to capture low- penetration categories, such as dishwashers and capitalize on structural opportunities in traditional products; successful execution on this \"second growth curve\" is key to sustaining earnings momentum beyond near- term base effects, in our view.",

We roll- forward our valuation date by six- months, and arrive at our new, higher target price of CNY20.30 (from CNY19.90) based on an unchanged 12.0x target F12M P/E. The stock currently trades at 12.2x FY25F PE. Despite marginal sales recovery expected in 3Q25F on an easier base, we remain concerned about the uncertainties around Robam's sales in the medium term, especially after the effect of the trade- in programs and also considering the unclear development of the China property sector. Maintain Neutral. We prefer Midea (000333 CH, Buy) in the home appliances value chain.",
