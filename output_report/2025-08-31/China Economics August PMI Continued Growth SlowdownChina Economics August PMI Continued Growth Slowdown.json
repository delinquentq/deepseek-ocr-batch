The 10bps uptick in manufacturing PMI was due to reduced weather disruptions on production (consensus: 20bps rise), but new orders remained steadily below 50. The rebound in service PMI (up 0.5pp to 50.5) was led by a seasonal uptick in summer travel services, but retail sales and property related services weakened. We thus maintain our 3Q real GDP tracking at \\(\\sim 4.5\\% Y,\\) and expect Sept. manufacturing PMI to stay \\(70\\) for two consecutive months.",
