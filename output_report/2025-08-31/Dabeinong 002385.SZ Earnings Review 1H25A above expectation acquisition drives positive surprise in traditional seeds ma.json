The inclusion of Longjing acquisition has led to positive surprises in traditional seeds revenue and margin. While non- seeds operations in feed and hog farming tend to be cyclical and lack structural improvement, we continue to view DBN's dominant position in bio- tech seeds trait will drive a transformation of the company in the coming years. We expect DBN's trait revenue to reach Rmb116mn in 2025E (7% of EBIT), followed by Rmb532mn (or 15% of EBIT) in 2026E, and Rmb1.9bn in a scenario where industry bio- tech seeds penetration reaches 90%, or equivalent to 118% of 2025E EBIT, equivalent to Rmb5.2/sh in valuation. Maintain Buy on DBN with 12- m target price of Rmb8.0/sh (unchanged).",
