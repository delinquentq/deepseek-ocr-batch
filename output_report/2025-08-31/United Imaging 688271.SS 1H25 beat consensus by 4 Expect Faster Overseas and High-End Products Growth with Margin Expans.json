The solid performance was driven by: 1) strong overseas rev. growth (+22% yoy); 2) continued market share gains in high-end products; 3) robust growth of high-margin service business (+32% yoy). Mgmt expect rev. growth to accelerate in 2H25 and guided for full-year net profit margin of 16-18% (vs. 15%+ guided in Apr 2025). The outlook is driven by: 1)continued domestic market recovery supported by stimulus funds and a manageable VBP impact; 2) accelerating overseas growth, with strong orders in hand; and 3) continued market share gains led by its high-end product portfolio.",

      "text": "Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return (\"ETR\") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"â€”\" and \"â€”\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re- establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management.
