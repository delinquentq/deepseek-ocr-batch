From the track record with huge variance in each historical cycle, we recognize 1H25's 1.34x cost-volume elasticity appears to be extremely high. By assuming Aug-Dec25 BYD monthly MoM growth at a consistent trend of 5%/7.5%/10% MoM, this should yield 2H shipments at 2.34/2.49/2.66mn units (9%/16%/24% HoH). If we maintain the above 1.34x ratio, 2H25 fixed cost (D&A + R&D) per vehicle should fall by 12% to 32% HoH, implying a fixed-cost-per-vehicle reduction at Rmb3.6k-9.5k HoH, implying 2H25 NP/vehicle should rebound to Rmb8.5k-14.4k with BYD auto 2H NP at Rmb20-40bn mathematically (implying H-shr now trades at 18.6-28.5x 25E PER).

Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities.

At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short- term volatility or trading patterns.
