The EL platform supports multiple form factors and battery packs ranging from \\(2.2 - 5.0\\mathrm{kWh}\\) . Safety and convenience have also been enhanced through the Advanced Electronic Braking System (AEBS), which shortens braking distances and prevents rear- wheel lockups.

This will be driven by rising EV mix, new products and effective execution of its premiumization strategy. We expect the future products to ramp up faster as its distribution network would already be ramped up by then. Further, economies of scale, falling battery costs and value engineering should continue to drive up margins. We arrive at a TP of INR458 based on an EV/sales multiple of 3.3x average of FY27- 28F sales. Its current valuation at 2.8x FY27F EV/Sales is in line with peers like TVS, which we find attractive given that its revenue growth is likely to remain much faster than peers over the next decade.
