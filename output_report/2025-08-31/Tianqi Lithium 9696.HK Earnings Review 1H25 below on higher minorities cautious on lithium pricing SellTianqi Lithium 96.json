On the industry level, we recognize the recent supply disruption from China supply should provide support of spot lithium carbonate price beyond its current domestic marginal cost support. However, lithium supply is more global in nature than others, and risk on the current spot price, \\(39\\%\\) above the bottom in June, is on the downside in our view, given the intrinsic excess capacity globally. Risk reward has yet to turn positive - our bottom- of- the- cycle valuation analysis suggests a theoretical valuation of RMB16.0/sh for Tianqi at spot lithium carbonate price of US\\(10.5k/t-LCE, or RMB20.8/sh if at US\\)16.0k/t-LCE, versus current share price of HK\\)40.7/sh for H and RMB44.0/sh for A. Despite earnings cut, we revise up 12- m target prices to HK\\(21.5/RMB\\)25.0 (from HK\\)19.0/RMB21.0) due to our higher bottom of cycle valuation under higher spot lithium prices used.
