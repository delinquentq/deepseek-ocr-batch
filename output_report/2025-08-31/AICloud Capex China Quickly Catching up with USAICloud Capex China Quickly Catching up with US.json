BABA/Baidu reported \\(57\\% /30\\%\\) QoQ capex growth. We previously highlighted 2Q25 cloud capex may not be exciting as our industry checks suggested large CSPs focused on securing chip supply from the GPU rental market in 2Q (following the US ban on H20). However, we think some CSPs chose to secure supply in the GPU rental market by buying the chips from renters instead of renting. That is likely why there was surprisingly strong capex growth of \\(168\\%\\) at BAT in 2Q, vs \\(100\\%\\) growth in 1Q. China's CSP capex has been on a structural and accelerating growth trend since 1Q23 (Chart 1), driven by both AI and Internet business volume growth. BABA has been the biggest growth driver (Chart 2). We also highlight that capex growth is driven not only by AI, as shown by strong demand for general servers, as seen in ZTE's 1H25 results.",

Although China's absolute CSP capex (incl our est for Bytedance at around US \\(14bn\\) ) in the last 12 months is only \\(15\\%\\) of that of its US peers, its capex to cloud rev ratio has exceeded that of the US since 4Q24 (Chart 4). In 2Q25, China's ratio was at \\(121\\%\\) vs the US at \\(94\\%\\) . That indicates Chinese CSPs are likely becoming even more aggressive than their US peers in AI/cloud capex. On the other hand, Chinese CSPs' capex to total rev ratio is still much lower than that of the US, but has been rising more rapidly (Chart 5). The likely reason for the discrepancy in these two ratios is that the US CSPs have massive cloud revenue (from both the US and RoW) vs the Chinese CSPs. For BAT, cloud accounted for only \\(11\\%\\) of their total rev, vs \\(20\\%\\) for the three US CSPs combined. Moreover, we believe the 3 Chinese CSPs have been aggressively pursuing AI capex to improve their core businesses, instead of for their 3rd-party enterprise customers in cloud. Thus, investors may be able to see rapid improvement in these CSPs' core business in the next year or two due to AI deployment.",

      "text": "China's much lower but rapidly rising capex could drive faster downstream AI adoption. We see 3 reasons why China's AI capex is lower than the US: 1) Chinese CSPs rev size is much smaller, given constraints in overseas expansion due to geopolitics; 2) bigger focus on profitability since the gov stepped up regulations in 2021; and 3) US chip restrictions (this is the least of the 3 reasons, in our view). But lower investment and focus on commercialization/ profitability likely will drive faster AI adoption, since AI applications thus developed would not have to be priced high for both enterprises and consumers. China is also forced to focus on compute efficiency (e.g., DeepSeek), and does not have power shortages or high power costs.",
