This should likely result in very strong growth in the commercial aero business of Syesnqo (\\~12% of group sales are exposed to commercial aero) and possibly also for Victrex (commercial aero around 5% of group sales) in 2026. JPM US Aerospace analyst Seth Seifman in his latest note after meeting with Boeing's CEO highlights that while Boeing is currently building 737 steadily at a 38/month rate, it is preparing to ramp up to 42/month after seeking approval by FAA, which our colleagues expect to happen later this year. Mgmt has spoken of needing to stay at 42/mo and then 47/mo for at least six months each before moving higher. Regarding its production lines, Boeing is staffed for well into the 40s. Production rate of 787 seems stable at 7/month but has potential to move up to 10/month at the existing Charleston, SC footprint. Ryanair (covered by Harry Gowers) CEO also commented during Reuters and Bloomberg interviews that Boeing has accelerated 737 Max deliveries and that Boeing has expressed confidence in raising the 737 Max production run-rate to 42/month by Oct.",

If Boeing manages to increase its production rate to 42/month in 4Q25, it may potentially drive very strong growth in SYENS's composites business in 2026. Our bottom-up model suggests that SYENS's composites business sales might be up almost 20% in 2026. The operational leverage from the likely strong growth in this business, along with expected net cost savings, might be enough to underwrite the current FY26 consensus. Thus, there is upside potential (JPME 2026E adj EBITDA is 3% above Bloomberg consensus and implies 14% organic growth) from a recovery in other end markets and incremental contribution from recent growth investments, as well as the ongoing push by management to inculcate a \"hunting culture\" within the sales force to win new business in its most differentiated businesses.",

The acceleration in category growth, which seems to be most notable in make- up, is a slight positive for companies with a relative high exposure to the North America beauty/personal care markets.

That said, for a few chemicals, net export volumes from China to Europe were in-line with or even below the peak levels of the past three years, likely due to a combination of import duties in a few cases (e.g. titanium dioxide, vanillin, epoxy resins) and weak underlying demand. For the products we track, Chinese export/import price trends were mixed with a \\(2\\%\\) median decline in export prices vs. Jun 2025 (MoM), despite higher naphtha (oil derivative) prices in the prior month - i.e. indicative of incremental margin pressure, with a \\(8\\%\\) median decline vs. Jul 2024 (YoY).

The organic sales growth (OSG) CAGR target of 6-9% from 2025 to 2030 that Novonesis (NSISB) management presented last week remains best in class in our coverage. We are encouraged by the breadth of growth opportunities across multiple end markets, as is also reflected in at least HSD% OSG seen across all the key divisions in 1H25. The key mantra remains to stretch the core by leveraging its enviable technological edge (9%+ R&D/sales) and its ability to customize offerings (which also drives higher differentiation and pricing power) to increase penetration of its existing and new products, while also exploring growth from potential new applications/markets. This also partly explains the higher than expected capex/sales guidance of LDD% for the next three years (vs. our previous estimate of \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) ) as the company is building a platform to be able to deliver faster growth (up to \\(9\\%\\) CAGR) than seen in the past ( \\(\\sim 6\\%\\) OSG CAGR over the past 10 years) with an underlying post-tax ROIC of \\(>20\\%\\) .

JPM CEEMEA chemicals analyst Alex Comer highlights that Q2 earnings for petrochemical stocks were weak, with conservative outlooks. Dow's CEO has highlighted a prolonged earnings downturn and unclear recovery prospects. H2 outlook remains subdued due to expected oil price declines as inventories build and slowing global GDP growth (JPM estimates \\(1.5\\%\\) in H2 vs \\(2.4\\%\\) in H1). Additional petrochemical capacity is expected in China, with significant ethylene capacity closures announced in Europe and South Korea. China's \"anti-involution\" policies may impact chemical capacities, with Sinopec potentially reducing capacity additions and shutting loss-making operations. Asian and MENA petrochemical stocks have recently rebounded, driven by investor interest in anti-involution strategies. However, uncertainty remains around the timing of capacity closures, and planned Chinese ethylene capacity additions are likely to proceed, albeit potentially phased.

Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analyst's coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.",
