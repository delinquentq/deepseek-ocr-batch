Under PRC GAAP, negative gross margin widened to -4.9%, vs.3.4% in Q2 24 and -1.1% in Q1 25. Operating loss (i.e. EBIT ex. investment income) also widened and arrived at RMB -3.7bn, vs. RMB -1.8bn loss in Q2 24 and RMB -3.0bn loss in Q1 25. JVs and associates brought in only RMB 0.8bn of profits, vs. RMB 0.2bn in Q2 24 and RMB 1.1bn in Q1 25, and GAC ended with a net loss of RMB -2.4bn for the quarter, implying -10.5% in net loss margin, vs. net margin of 0.5% in Q2 24 and -5.5% net loss margin in Q1 25. The company's performance has been severely impacted by lower sales volume,increased discounts, reduced government subsidies, and increased inventory writedown.",

Gross margin fell to -4.9%, and operating loss doubled yoy. As part of its restructuring, GAC is now partnering with Huawei, following other state-backed OEMs. New \"Huawang\" EVs set to launch in early 2026 will feature Huawei's intelligent driving and smart cockpit solutions. Since July 2025,GAC has also adopted Huawei's IPD and IPMS systems to improve product development and marketing. To date, OEMs such as Seres, Chery, and most recently SAIC have achieved notable successes through their collaborations with Huawei. However, as more brands leverage Huawei's technology and expertise, the risk of cannibalization within the \"Huawei ecosystem\" increases. The key question is: at what point does this overlap diminish the incremental benefits for latecomers like GAC, potentially limiting their upside?",
