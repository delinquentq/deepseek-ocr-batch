We see that the effects of tightened loan regulation introduced on June 27, along with implementation of the third- phase of stress DSR rules, and overall tightening policy bias on property is leading to weaker sentiment. We expect transaction volumes to continue declining in 2H25, supported by the government's commitment to stringent household debt management and more restrictive conditions for foreigner home purchases in the Seoul Metro area.",
