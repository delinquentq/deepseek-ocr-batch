Expansion of the product basket: Zydus Wellness is currently present in consumer health areas, such as: a) low sugar, protein snacking and energy categories with a leadership position in sugar substitutes in India with its SugarFree brands, b) skincare products like Nyet and EverYuth, and c) nutrition related products with its Naturell (RiteBite) portfolio. Comfort Click's acquisition provides the company an entry into the Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (VMS) segment. The VMS market in Europe is currently estimated at GBP11bn (~USD15bn), and is expected to reach USD 50-60bn globally by 2030, as per management. \nb. Geographic diversification: Zydus Wellness' major international markets currently are Africa, the Middle East, SE Asia and Aus/NZ, with \\(\\sim 85\\%\\) of international revenue coming from the top-5 markets. Zydus Wellness had previously (1QFY26 earnings call) indicated its aim to increase contribution from international revenue in consolidated revenue to \\(\\sim 8 - 10\\%\\) in the next 4-5 years, from \\(\\sim 3 - 4\\%\\) currently. With the acquisition of Comfort Click, Zydus Wellness plans to increase its global footprint with entry into developed markets like the UK and Europe and further expansion into the US. We think the company may further intend to bring in the Comfort Click brands into India, amplifying its consumer care offerings in India.",
