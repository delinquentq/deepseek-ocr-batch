Mgmt observed: 1) a 1% improvement in total time spent; 2) 5% click through rate improvement in local services search and 4.5% GMV improvement in e-commerce search; 3) When using AI to understand ad content, Kuaishou's internal AB test demonstrated 8ppt improvement in ad recommendations. 4) Customer report ratio fell 20% by linking user behaviors (report, or positive/negative comment) to AI model. 5) Much lower cost for OneRec than previous funnel-based recommendation model.- AI-generated ad content demonstrated similar performance to traditional ads, but can save significant amounts of money for customers. Such ads also brings customers' incremental ads budget to Kuaishou.- Management believes it is relative easy to leverage on AI technology to improve ad recommendations, while it is relatively difficult to simulate other's reactions in the ad bidding system. So it is not urgent to aggressively monetize OneRec.- OneRec is still in iteration stage, and management expect it to take 50-60% of its traffic soon.",

Kuaishou thinks S&M expense as % of revenue can decline.- Ad business continues to see strong growth from short drama, game, education, local services (though food delivery platforms reduced the ads budget).- E-commerce operation: use the subsidies and commission incentive in a smart way. Shelf-based e-commerce will continue to outgrow. Kuaishou's advantage is the linkage between content and product. In terms of monetization, the take-rate doubled in the past year from a very low base. Management believes its GMV remains small compared with other platforms, it is willing to use some traffic to subsidise merchants. It takes time for the merchants' capabilities to improve. Kuaishou internally wants to bridge the systems for shelf-based e-commerce and live-broadcasting e-commerce ad platforms, which could bring some upside in future.- Commercialization can help content as well. As Kuaishou encourages high-quality ad contents, so in the past 2 years, more ads have not had a negative impact on user experience.- Mgmt sees limited impact on platform from the new tax on ad spending.- Technology improvement is not only about AI, Kuaishou's IDC and bandwidth cost as % revenue continues to fall without any impact to customer experience. It did a lot of optimization on the infra side with internal new resource management platform and new DC cluster in Ulanqab.",
