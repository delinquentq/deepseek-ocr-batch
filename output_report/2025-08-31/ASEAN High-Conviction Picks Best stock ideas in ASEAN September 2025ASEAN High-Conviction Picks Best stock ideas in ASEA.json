      "text": "Portfolio nameTickerRationaleSingaporeSTE SPWe see ST Engineering playing catch-up in share price vs. its regional plays with its solid orderbook(3x book-to-bill) and earnings growth justifying a higher P/E valuation multiple. Key catalysts include strong MRO demand in Commercial Aerospace, upside for Defence orderbook due to increasing geo-political tensions, and Smart City adoption in the US. The company is actively improving its capital management with a pledged dividend payout commitment of S$0.16/share (4%) yield) while balancing with reinvestment catered for future growth.MalaysiaCIMB MKNiaga/Indonesia related downside risks have been priced in, with CIMB Niaga results a beat. EPS expectations have been reset and CIMB could see a tactical benefit from flows reversal to Malaysia if a US trade deal materializes. At 0.96x fwd book, the stock offers upside.ThailandCPALL TBCPALL is a laggard among large cap (+8% past one month vs the SET&#x27;s +14%), and could play catch up on the recent flow-driven rally. Fundamentally, the business continues to be strong, supported by its dominant market position in the Thai grocery market. Valuation is attractive at 14x forward PE.IndonesiaANTM IJWe are positive on ANTM. Nickel ore premium continued to trend strongly in May and we expect the strong trend to carry over into June. 3 key drivers for ANTM have trended strongly in 2QTD, 1) nickel ore price 2) gold price and 3) gold sales volume. We expect 2Q earnings to be another all-time high quarterly earnings for ANTM (see latest report for 2QE).PhilippinesALI PMWe think ALI will benefit from an imminent policy rate cut given its historical re-rating during periods of lower interest rates. ALI is our preferred property pick with its dominance in the resilient horizontal and premium residential segments, improving mall leasing performance and on-track landbank pare down. Valuations are attractive at a record-low 10.4x 2025E P/E and 75% NAV discount, both &amp;gt;2SDs below LT means.VietnamVCB VNVCB offers visibility for high teens to 20% EPS growth in 2026/27, following weaker growth in 2025 on NIM pressure and absence of upfront fees. The stock is a direct beneficiary of the potential FTSE re-classification of VN to EM. Further, the bank is in the process of raising $1bn via a private placement, which could accelerate growth, if successful.FinancialsBDO PMBDO offers visibility on low teens loan growth and &amp;lt;14% ROE, despite rate cuts coming through. Risk-reward is increasingly attractive with the stock moving close to book value and trading near all-time lows PER. A scenario of a weaker USD would also be positive for the stock.Energy, Coal &amp; UtilitiesTNB MKUpside from accelerating Contingent Capex outlay intact as the stock trades around the floor value underpinned by its Base Capex under RP4.Consumer, Gaming &amp; HealthcareHMPRO TBThe stock is up/SPET in the last 3M and YTD, -8%/-25% vs SET&#x27;s +7%/-11% on continued SSSG decline amid weak consumer confidence. We will pick up the stock on weakness relating to the expected MSCI index-related down weight. HMPRO is supported by a share repurchase program and a possible lift from an October policy rate easing.Property &amp; ConglomeratesMPACT SPWe expect MPACT to deliver a faster pace of interest rate savings with ~9% drop in finance costs to 3.2% (from 3.5%) in FY26. FY26/27 yield of 6.2/6.4% is attractive vs. S-REIT yields of 5.6/5.7%, with our estimates ~3% above street. Backfilling of vacancies, retention of tenants at MBC, AEI completion at VivoCity (S$1m/mth, 1.5% of GRI) and slower decline in China will contribute to top-line recovery, while we anticipate acquisitions could restart with gearing at 37.6% post recent Japan sales. Amongst the mid-cap REITs, MPACT is now our top pick on DPU recovery with FY26/27 DPU to grow 1/3% vs. 9%p.a. decline over the last two yearsTelcos, Media &amp; TechnologyST SPSingtel is focusing on improving ROICs and is seeing an earnings turnaround across a number of its opcos. There is scope for Singtel to increase dividends through its cash reserves, improving cash flows in certain geographies, and further capital recycling. Improvements in ROICs and dividends could create Singtel, which appears to be trading at a deep valuation discount.Infrastructure, Transport &amp; IndustrialsASII IJWe are positive on Astra. Auto industry volumes could see a pickup on rate cuts and we believe the better capital allocation story has not been fully priced in.",

      "text": "Stock NameRationaleSGX SPSGX has already priced in government initiatives (up 20% in last 6M vs. 16% for STI). Our calculations suggest ~5% EPS pick-up from the announced measures, whereas we have already factored in 14% y/y increase in ADT for FY26. With the stock trading at 21.2x 12M fwd P/E (0.2 SD above mean), we expect it to remain relatively weak in the near term.CDB MKCDB is at risk from intense wireless competition. CDB&#x27;s underlying earnings could decline over the mid-term and CDB could see significant negative earnings revisions.TU TBMultiple pressured by heightened trade barrier under Trump 2.0, while GMT and transformation costs will pressure earning.BBNI IJ1Q NIM declined to 3.94%, with guidance for NIM weakness to sustain. Further, management is guiding for NPL formation to move up over next 1-2 quarters from downgrades in MSME segment. At valuations of 8.5x/0.95x 25 PE/PB, risks are skewed to the downside.BMRI IJWe worry on NIM-led PPoP risks, low b/s growth, as well as asset quality. Our EPS estimates are 12-15% below Street. At valuations of 9.2x/1.60x 25 PE/PB, risks are skewed to the downside.YZJSGD SPUncertainties will overhang its new order flow and revenue recognition, pointing to downside risks to street forecasts. YZJ&#x27;s revenue is largely recognized upon delivery, and any construction delays today will have a more substantial impact on longer-term revenue. Additionally, container shipping margins, which are particularly high, are expected to contract due to lower revenue booking.T MKWe see material downside risk to Street expectations and company guidance. 1Q25 revenues declined 6.5% qoq, with declines in voice, broadband and B2B revenues. Voice is likely to be in structural decline, while intense competition could weigh on broadband ARPUs in the foreseeable future, in our view.",
