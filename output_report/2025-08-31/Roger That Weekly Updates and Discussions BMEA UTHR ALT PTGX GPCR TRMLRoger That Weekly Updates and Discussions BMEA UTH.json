The proposal laid out biomarker's ability to predict risk of all- cause mortality or liver- related events in MASH pts, correlating w/ liver fibrosis severity. Liver biopsies are logistically challenging and pose safety risks due to its invasive nature.

Researchers in China took the lung from a CRISPR edited pig (Bama miniature pig, Clonorgan Biotechnology, Chengdu, China) and transplanted to a 39- year old brain- dead person. No hyperacute rejection was seen in the 1st 24h. However, increased pro- inflammatory molecules and white blood cells began infiltrating the pig lung by 24h, along with fluid build up in the new organ. By day 3, signs of antibody- mediated rejection of the lung was noted. On day 9, the experiment was terminated at the request of the recipient's family. Note, one limitation of the study was that by leaving behind the right lung of the patient, the group was not able to assess whether the pig lung was life- supporting. The team is planning to perform more transplants into brain- dead patients, and those future experiments will explore testing bilateral lung transplantation, evaluating pig lungs with more gene edits, and refining the immunosuppressive regimen. Lung xenotransplantation presents unique biological and technical challenges compared to other organs, as lung is continually exposed to the outside air, including any bacteria, viruses, pollen, or environmental toxins, while the biological structures that facilitate the gas exchange make the organ very fragile compared to the muscular heart or the stem- cell laden liver, which can regenerate after damage. The procedure marks the 1st attempt for xenotransplant of lung.",
