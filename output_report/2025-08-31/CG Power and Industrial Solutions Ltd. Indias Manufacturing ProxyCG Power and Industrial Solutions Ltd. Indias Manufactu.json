Further, in its younger businesses, like railways, CGPI has increased its product portfolio (originally & inorganically), and it is incubating a semiconductor division (organic capex: outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) + inorganic+ semis design).",

Currently, many factories in India rely on electrical systems alone. With the right drive, an electric motor will adjust to the underlying load, leading to significant power savings. Drives control the speed of an AC motor by varying the frequency and voltage of the power being fed to it. When they are not controlled by a drive, many motors run at full speed even when the load requirements are minimal. The drives are an additional cost, but in the long term the efficiency, variance, accuracy, and energy savings that drives provide make them a cost-effective addition.",

We believe larger companies with capacity and capabilities stand to benefit. CGPI has less than \\(10\\%\\) market share in transformers, coupled with capacity additions over the next couple of years providing ample growth headroom. There have been a series of announcements for new transformer capacity expansions from major global players, but there are supply- side constraints on material, equipment, and skilled labor, thus driving lead times higher for both AC & DC transformers (i.e., a more acute shortage). We note that companies must also navigate the evolving tariff situation in this multipolar world to increase their export footprints.",
