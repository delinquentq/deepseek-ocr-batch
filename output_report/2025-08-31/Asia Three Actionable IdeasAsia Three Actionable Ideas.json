After an idea has been introduced, if our stock analyst changes rating within the 13 weeks, the idea is assumed to be closed on the next Tuesday.Outperformance is determined by stock performance over local benchmark performance, adjusting for direction (i.e., buy for Overweight-rated stocks, sell for Underweight-rated stocks).The Cumulative Outperformance tracker has an assumed starting point of 100 on April 26, 2016. Average weekly outperformance is calculated for all ideas. Tracker level grows/(declines) by average weekly out/(under)performance every week.Separately, outperformance for the period from the start date to every Tuesday (or idea close date, whichever is earlier) for each idea is calculated. The hit ratio is defined as number of ideas with positive returns as a percentage of the total number of ideas. We track the hit ratio on a weekly basis.In both metrics, costs such as brokerage commissions, transaction costs, trading costs, etc., are not considered.",
