The EPICS- III trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of Saroglitazar in treating adult patients with PBC, that are not adequately responding or are intolerant to the first- line medication ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The trial has met the primary end point and achieved a defined biochemical response. In the clinical trial Saroglitazar, 1mg was administered once daily. We note that in the earlier phases of clinical trials, higher dosages of Saroglitazar, i.e., 2mg and 4mg once daily were also considered. However, Saroglitazar achieved the desired clinical outcome at a lower dose. The biochemical endpoint for the trial was for patients to achieve three parameters with respect to biomarkers: 1) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \\(Fig. 1: Treatment difference at 52 weeks for second line treatment drugs",
