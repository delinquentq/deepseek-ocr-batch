This was driven by a low prior- year comparison and the effects of adopting subsidies appearing in June, which boosted 1Q orders. However, demand remains somewhat weak due to tariff issues and wage hike pressures, and a cautious approach to capital investment may continue. (2) North America: 1Q and July orders were strong, supported by large- scale data center projects and some movement among SMEs. Amada has high expectations for order recovery from 2Q onward. It estimates that data center- related orders account for \\(10 - 20\\%\\) of total US orders. (3) Europe: Still challenging, but appears to have bottomed out. Attention is now on the impact of fiscal easing. (4) Other Asia: Mixed performance by region—Taiwan and Oceania are recovering, China remains solid, while ASEAN is weak.",
