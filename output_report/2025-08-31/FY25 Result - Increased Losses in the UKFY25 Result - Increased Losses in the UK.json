This timeline appears achievable, as PXA indicated that the S&P platform will be available in several weeks. However, there has been limited progress with other Tier-1 lenders, which are necessary to create a network effect and drive adoption of PEXA UK. If/when additional lenders join, PXA will also incur further losses before commensurate revenue benefits are realised, likely prompting further downward revisions to our forecasts for FY26 and FY27. In addition, risks remain concerning PXA's relationships with conveyancers, who are integral to cash property transactions (no lender involved, c. 30% of all monetary transactions). Industry feedback suggests there are negative perceptions among the practitioners regarding Smoove and Optima Legal, both owned by PXA, as they also have conveyancing business. Restructuring these businesses may be required to reduce friction with the conveyancers, management distractions and ongoing losses.",

The risk of inter-operability appears to have subsided but PXA needs to invest more capex in the Exchange business given that the technology is becoming outdated, needing to increase capex in FY26 and perhaps into FY27 to modernise the IT platform, borrowing from the learnings in the UK.",
