We model LAM's 2026 system shipments to align closely with WFE (LAM +5% vs WFE +5%) as the company's growth drivers (China, NAND) slow after two very strong years (2024- 25). Despite our appreciation for LAM's NAND story (25pt share gain over the last decade), end- markets just aren't robust enough to drive further growth for LAM and NAND WFE. We expect growth to decelerate from 82% in 2025 to 3% in 2026. China Logic has been LAM's biggest growth driver since 2021 as the company expanded its share in the region. However, following 37%/35% y/y growth in 2024/2025, we don't foresee a reacceleration and model 3% growth in 2026. We project 8% growth in non- China logic driven by TSMC, but a slowdown in NAND & China (54% of shipments) limits total shipment growth. We don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with LAM; it's just hard to see LAM outgrowing WFE in 2026, and expect relative share performance to lag as a result.",
