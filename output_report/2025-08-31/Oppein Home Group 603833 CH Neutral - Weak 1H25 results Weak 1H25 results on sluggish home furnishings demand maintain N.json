In 1H25, the company delivered revenue of CNY8.24bn, down \\(4.0\\%\\) y- y, with attributable net profit of CNY1.02bn, up \\(2.9\\%\\) y- y. We believe the slower-than- expected sales performance reflects sluggish home furnishing demand and limited progress from channel transformation; in detail: (1) the government trade- in subsidies provided little uplift for Oppein, with most categories declining again off a low base; (2) although the net reduction of stores narrowed in 1H25 compared with 2024, closures still weighed on revenue. On a positive note, profitability was supported by an improved channel mix and tighter cost control, offsetting impact from weaker investment income, leading to a 0.8pp y- y improvement in net margin to \\(12.4\\%\\) .",

      "text": "Revenue likely to stay under pressure in the near termLooking ahead, we believe Oppein's revenue is likely to remain under pressure in the near term, as (1) government subsidies appear more effective for soft furnishings than for customized furniture in terms of stimulating end consumer demand; (2) the company's ongoing channel restructuring has yet to deliver clear results. Against the backdrop of weaker new and secondary home transactions, we do not expect a meaningful recovery in 2H25F, though the degree of pressure may ease slightly compared with 1H25. Profitability should also face some headwinds, as external operating conditions show little signs of improvement, in our view. Over the medium- to long term, we think Oppein's recovery will hinge on both property sales stabilization and the effectiveness of the company's channel reform strategy.",
