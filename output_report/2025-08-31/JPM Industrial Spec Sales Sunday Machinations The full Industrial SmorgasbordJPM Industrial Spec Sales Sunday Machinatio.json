The summer is drawing to a close and people are back from the beach and ready to go. We are, of course, heading into conference season and my teams have a plethora of 'back to school' speaker series starting from next week. We have Chemicals, Construction and Capital Goods companies booked and our autos team maintains its incredible corporate access calendar. Invites for all hit your inbox during the week bit if you need details please do let me know. In addition, some of you might be in the wharf next week at a competitor conference so if you fancy a coffee or just some air and a catch up please do let me know.",

      "text": "The big news from the JPM Industrials Franchise this week was Phil Buller's 'reinitiation' on Siemens, Legrand, ABB and Schneider. We have been NR on these stocks since I joined and it's nice to have active recommendations on them now - and the notes published are high quality. We started with Siemens at Overweight (HERE) and then followed it up with a piece covering all 4 of the Big Cap Electricals (HERE). Legrand is Overweight while both Schneider and ABB are Neutral. The outlook for these companies is good. There are details in the sector piece as to why we remain very confident that Data Centres will remain a multi year growth opportunity - but this is largely, in the next 3 years, reflected in consensus forecasts. We therefore look for incremental positives from either other end markets or idiosyncratic opportunities. Siemens tops the bill for idio opportunity with the December CMD likely to address plans for a reduction in the SHL stake alongside plans and targets for improving margins in the DI division. Legrand has the most interesting end market set up. They are assumed to be late to the DC party but this is, in part, due to the fact that their European residential construction and US office construction exposure have been seeing significant declines - and where we now see green shoots for European resi and there are encouraging signs of stabilisation in the US office market. Coupled with their DC exposure which is largely into the white space, or server room and growth should accelerate from here - which drives out above consensus forecasts. ABB hosts a CMD in November (18th) and is due to spins (or sell) its Robotics division so there are catalysts - and its operational performance has been excellent. Schneider's challenge is to show margin gearing. A CMD would be helpful but there is not one planned as far as we can see.",

      "text": "The Legrand call serves as a reminder that for a large number of our Capital Goods coverage there has been practically no volume growth for a number of years - but this might be about to improve - and when we get volume growth we also get operational leverage and this allows our companies to consistently beat consensus. Broad rule of thumb is that you get more margin gearing in the machinery end of the sector - and, for me, Sandvik and SKF look interesting on the long side. We should also get operating leverage in the truck sector if Akshat is correct about the end market recovery. He published a note in Mid August (HERE) highlighting signs of recovery in European truck markets and scope for a rebound in US heavy truck orders in Q4. Volvo is most preferred (Positive Catalyst Watch) whilst Triton is least preferred. Daimler Trucks has the most upside potential from self help. As a side note, if we get a recovery in European heavy truck demand will we also see an improvement in light commercial vehicle demand? If so, Renault looks interesting because I've finally realised that their LCV business makes more difference to the group margins and FCF than the car business.",

Current trading is largely unchanged from the Q2 print although the CEO noted that 'Germany is becoming more confident' - even if they do not expect to see project announcements on the back of the stimulus package until early 2026. The likely debate point from the event revolves around strategy - with the Company indicating it is pursuing acquisitions (could be up to CHF1bn) in light (ish) side materials. It wants to become a solutions provider to the construction industry with an offer of Roofing, Walling, Flooring and Foundational materials alongside the concrete it supplies. Commentary regarding the medium term consolidation of the European cement market was supportive - and, in the near term, the Company expects European pricing to move up in early 2026. We are awaiting the new carbon benchmark from the EU and the Company expects it to be Eur40 or higher which would prompt double digit price increases. Further support comes due to industry consumption of existing carbon",

      "text": "In Chemicals we finally got some good news for the speciality end of the sector with Ulta Beauty on Friday boosting its sales forecasts due to strength in its fragrances business. Too late in the year to use the swallows and summers analogy but you get my point. It does also offer a useful segway to Chetan's reiteration of his Novonesis OW. He published a note on Thursday and highlights that the new OSG targets from last week \\((6 - 9\\%)\\) is best in class in his coverage and that the higher capex is therefore justified. he also notes that the stock is cheaper than it has been over the past couple of years despite growth forecasts being higher. We are encouraged by the breadth of growth opportunities across multiple end markets, as is also reflected in at least HSD's OSG seen across all the key divisions in 1H25. The key mantra remains to stretch the core by leveraging its enviable technological edge \\((9\\% +\\) R&D/sales) and its ability to customize offerings (which also drives higher differentiation and pricing power) to increase penetration of its existing and new products, while also exploring growth from potential new applications/ markets. This also partly explains the higher than expected capex/sales guidance of LDD% for the next three years (vs. our previous estimate of \\(\\sim 10\\%\\) ) as the company is building a platform to be able to deliver faster growth (up to \\(9\\%\\) CAGR) than seen in the past \\((\\sim 6\\%\\) OSG CAGR over the past 10 years) with an underlying post- tax ROIC of \\(>20\\%\\) . We cut our FY25- 28E adj EPS by \\(4 - 5\\%\\) , largely to reflect the incremental FX headwinds and as a result we also trim our Dec 2026 PT to DKK 512 (DKK 545). That said, with a potential \\(10\\% +\\) adj EPS CAGR over the next 3- 5 years with high underlying ROIC, we see the recent derating - FY25/26/27E P/E of \\(28x / 26x / 24x\\) vs. the historical long- term multiple of \\(\\sim 30x\\) - as an attractive entry point, with our DCF model suggesting an upside potential to DKK 590. Remain OW. NOTE IS HERE.",

      "text": "So to finish - have you noticed there's been nothing on defence so far? This in part reflects the fact that the noises around potential peace processes have been quieter this week and the sector has been somewhat calmer. I'm not sure that is going to continue and my trade idea lower down is to buy Rheinmetall into the conference season. The combination of a packed conference schedule (they are due to appear at 9 between now and the Q3 results) and the hotting up of the German legislative machine should see the shares outperform. The German Government draft budget was published on August \\(15^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) and there are some big numbers in there - both for munition spend and for equipment. In addition the Bundeswehr needs to recruit a significant number of recruits (with draft legislation, according to BBG on Wednesday, being prepared to allow this to happen). We're at the end of the summer and in each of the last 3 years this has been a good time to buy defence - and the elements are in place to see that trade work again this year.",

We expect that the Company will provide investors with the building blocks of their €40- 50bn revenue guide for 2030.

Alongside the Company's conference appearances, there is a heavy legislative programme for German parliamentarians from September \\(8^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) when they return to work. This includes passing last year's and this year's defence budget, passing legislation which will allow the German army to bolster its numbers by \\(80\\%\\) and should also lead to the placement off at least the \\(1^{\\mathrm{st}}\\) tranche of the €25bn armoured vehicle order that has been discussed in the press.
