      "text": "**2Q25 a big miss although rev growth beat.** ZTE's 2Q25 rev grew by 21%, due mainly to strong server rev growth, but its core OP and reported NP fell 32%/13%. Although its rev beat cons by 12%, its core OP and reported NP were 25% and 2% below cons. In 1H25, its G&C (gov and enterprise) rev grew 110% YoY, driven by ~200% growth in server rev. 90% of its server rev was classified as G&C (mainly for Internet players and other enterprises) and the rest classified as carrier (sold to telcos). Even if 55% of its server rev comes from AI servers (using both US and local chips), we estimate its GM at only 4-5%. That is why its G&C GM in 1H25 fell sharply YoY from 21.8% to 8.3%. ZTE's most important rev category, carrier, which was still 49% of total rev in 1H25, fell 6% and saw a GM decline of 1.4ppt to 52.9%. The rev decline was driven mainly by weak Chinese telco capex. We believe Chinese telco capex will continue to fall, as 5G capex has peaked but 6G is still far away (likely 2028/29), and the three telcos have been tightly controlling costs and capex as their revenue growth has slowed to 1%. Its consumer business (smartphone+home terminals) saw 8% rev growth in 1H25 but GM also dropped by 1.2ppt to 17.8%. We are cautious on the outlook of the consumer business in 2H25, driven by our bearish view on smartphone (Android in particular), and more competition in the home terminal market (modem, router and set-top boxes).",

The significant market share gain is likely driven by the fact that 1) China's largest server player has been US sanctioned, 2) the next two largest server players are also vulnerable to US sanctions, but 3) ZTE has very low sanctionable risk given it has already paid the US govt a large settlement penalty and is still being monitored by the US DoC. We estimate server assembly generates 4% to 5% GM, vs carrier at 40%+. We estimate ZTE's server market share could grow further to 10% in the next three years, but its carrier rev will continue to see negative growth in 2025/26/27. That would gradually blended GM down from ~38% in 2024 to ~25% in 2028E.",
