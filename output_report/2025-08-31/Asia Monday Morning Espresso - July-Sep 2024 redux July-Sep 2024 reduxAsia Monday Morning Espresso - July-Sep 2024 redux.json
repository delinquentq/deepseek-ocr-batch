      "text": "With NVDA results out of the way and in- line US Core PCE on Friday, all eyes will be on US' August NFP report in the coming week. July's NFP report was clearly weak and another weak report will likely provide fodder to macro- bears, in our view. Nomura's US economists expect \\(+85k\\) headline gains (vs consensus' \\(75k\\) ) and the unemployment rate (UE) at \\(4.3\\%\\) (in line with consensus), which we think should not unnerve equity investors. However, in a scenario, where the NFP report is clearly weaker (4.3% UE), we think risk- appetite could take a hit as growth slowdown concerns might outweigh the Fed rate- cut theme. Price action in US Al/tech stocks - a major support for indices - has been shaky again this past week with DELL and MRVL stock prices weak after results on Friday in US hours. We note that the last time we witnessed two straight misses were the July and August 2024 US jobs report when risk appetite did take a hit ( \\(\\sim 8.5\\%\\) and \\(10\\%\\) drawdown in the S&P and MXASJ, respectively within one month). This was despite the market pricing in an aggressive set of Fed rate cuts as signalled by falling short- end US bond yields (Fig. 1). Tech/momentum stocks saw an unwinding, too (also amplified by Yen strength and NKY plunge in Aug'24), and underperformance relative to Value (Fig. 2). Thus, if the NFP report is indeed quite weak, we think tech/momentum stocks may be more vulnerable. In this scenario, in Asia- ex- Japan, we would be most concerned about Taiwan and Korea tech/momentum stocks. For India, we remain concerned due to ongoing tensions with the US which has dented the narrative on India stocks (EU considering secondary sanctions on Russia's oil related exports is another risk to monitor for India, in our view). However, we remain tactically positive on HK/China stocks where we think strong liquidity and stable US- China relations can continue to support a further re- rating of stocks, and reiterate our view that \"bubble\" fears are premature. If anything, HK/China stocks (especially domestic, laggards) may get some additional support from potential re- allocation flows should there be some profit- taking in tech stocks in the region.",

      "text": "On a multi- month view, as we have noted in the past (refer Asia- ex- Japan Equity Strategy - Lessons from the past six Fed rate cut cycles): Stock market outlook will matter on whether Fed rate cuts are coming due to a very weak US economy (i.e., US recession) or due to disinflationary pressures. In this regard, we think revisiting equities performance during the 2001 vs 1998 Fed rate cut cycle is instructive (Fig. 3 - 4). The 1998 rate cut cycle was caused by a financial turmoil that coincided with a \\(\\sim 19\\%\\) drawdown in the S&P before eventually culminating into the tech- bubble of 2000- 01 (Fig. 3). In contrast, the 2001 Fed rate cuts were driven by the dot- com bust, coinciding with a mild recession, with stocks posting steep declines driven by tech/growth stocks - the same ones that had powered the S&P higher earlier (Fig. 4). For further discussion, refer Asia Monday Morning Espresso - Is this 2001 redux or 1998 (or neither)?. Our baseline view at this juncture is that the US economy will avoid a recession, while we remain optimistic on the prospects of the AI thematic (although occasional intermittent valuations over- runs are always possible).",

Nomura's US economists expect headline job gains of \\(85k\\) (slightly higher than consensus' \\(+75k\\) ). They also think there could be a modest upward revision to July NFP. They believe that the unemployment rate, which has been emphasized by policymakers as a reliable measure to gauge labor market strength, likely ticked up by one- tenth to \\(4.3\\%\\) in August (same as consensus), and expect wage growth (AHE) at \\(0.3\\%\\) m- m (same as consensus). Overall, our US team continues to believe that the labor market is losing momentum and the shifting balance of risks to the Fed's dual mandate, is likely to lead to a 25bp cut at the September meeting. However, contained layoffs and few signs of acute labor market stress are likely to limit aggressive easing, in their view. Apart from this, there is some Fedspeak where Fed officials (including Williams) are expected to speak at separate events. In hard data, JOLTS job opening likely fell to 7370k in July (vs 7437k in June), bringing down the VU ratio to 1.02; ISM Manufacturing index likely edged up to 48.7 (NMR estimate slightly below consensus) in August; ISM Services Index also likely ticked up to 51.2 (NMR estimate above consensus) in August.",

Elsewhere in Asia - the BNM will hold its policy meeting and our economists expect no change in rates after the 'pre- emptive' 25bp cut at its previous MPC meeting. In other events, Shanghai Cooperation Summit is currently being held in China where President Putin, PM Modi and President Xi are expected to meet.
