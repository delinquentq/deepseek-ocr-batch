InnoScience** (INNO) 1H25 rev grew 43%, driven by 49% growth in GaN chips and ICs, 123% growth in GaN modules but offset by a 21% fall in GaN wafers (some customers switched from wafers to chips/ICs). Strong module rev growth was likely driven by some delayed shipment from last year to a very large lithium battery maker, and the start of shipment to a cryto mining customer (both are 1200V products). GM's swing into positive territory at a faster pace was underpinned by rapid revenue growth but limited capex (thus D&A) in 1H25. We believe capex will start rising next year (2.5x growth from 2025) as mass production (MP) of new products for Al servers and EV should start ramping in 2026. We see GaN as an indispensable semi solution for efficient high-power transmission for next-gen tech applications including EV, Al servers and data centers, robotics (especially dexterous hands in humanoid robots, where space is limited) and solar. Hence, INNO as the world's largest and rapidly growing GaN IDM will likely play a dominant role in this fast-growing market.",

In commenting on its cooperation** with NVDA, mgt highlighted accurate numbers are not yet available, but they see GaN being a critical element in NVDA's 800VDC architecture. Mgt also estimated the potential GaN content (areas that can deploy GaN) could grow more than 10x between the current NVL72 rack and its future Ruben Ultra design. Since the MP timing of Ruben Ultra is in 2H27, we believe NVDA will publish its final detailed design of the power rack in 2H25, so that the supply chain could get ready for component testing in 2026. This could be another positive catalyst for INNO, as the market will likely have better visibility of the GaN content in its design.",

Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a \\(15\\%\\) stop loss, and the remainder will have a \\(20\\%\\) stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.",
