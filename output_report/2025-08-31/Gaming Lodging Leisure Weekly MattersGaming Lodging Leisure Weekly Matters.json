In a relatively quiet week, the performance of these three stocks, \\(- 0.3\\%\\) \\(+10.9\\%\\) and \\(- 12.9\\%\\) for the week, respectively, was a focus of investors. In our view, FUN is impacted by the void of information on leadership and guidance, which challenges a reasonable support level. Meanwhile, the updates from Macau suggest GGR could be up \\(13 - 16\\%\\) in August, which we believe is driven by several forces, but nonetheless implies \\(\\sim 20\\%\\) + growth in EBITDA which is not reflected in estimates. The start- off to September would be critical in whether there is follow- through on the strength in a seasonally quiet month ahead of October Golden Week. Finally, the weakness in CHDN is driven by any obvious trend, with monthly data points coming in solidly, most notably in VA. However, the closing of Salem casino property could bring incremental capital spending, which we believe could be weighing on the shares.",

Statewide NY OSB trends continued from last week, with hold down 100bps WoW to \\(6.3\\%\\) on handle up \\(82\\%\\) YoY (again driven by Fanatics' handle nearly 1,000% YoY). Note- reports indicate that last week Fanatics took a single wager of over \\(100M\\) , which very well could have been repeated this week. Despite the strong handle, Fanatics hold fell another 160bps WoW to just \\(0.2\\%\\) , holding \\(441K\\) on \\(231M\\) in wagers. Aside from Fanatics, hold increased WoW for all operators exFLUT, which held just \\(8.9\\%\\) on the week (its first sub- DD hold since April).
