With production expected early 2024, the restart of Honeymoon positions Boss as one of a small number of pure- play uranium producers set to benefit from strongly- improving uranium market fundamentals. Under Boss, several technical changes to the Honeymoon operation have been introduced, reflecting advances in processing technology since Uranium One oversaw its initial start- up in 2011. We see minimal risk with these given their use elsewhere in the uranium industry. With a strong balance sheet, including no debt and a significant 1.25Mlbs of \\(\\cup_{3}0_{8}\\) held in inventory, Boss is well positioned to deliver on Honeymoon.
