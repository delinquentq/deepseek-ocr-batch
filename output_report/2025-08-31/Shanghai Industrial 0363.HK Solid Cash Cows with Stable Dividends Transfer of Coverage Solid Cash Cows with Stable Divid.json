In 1H25, its toll road business delivered largely stable performance with steady growth YoY in traffic volume \\((+2\\%)\\) and toll revenue \\((+5\\%)\\) . Despite the tightening global tobacco- control policies and intensified competition, Nanyang Tobacco appears to demonstrate resilience. With a declining net debt ratio (60.99% by end- 1H25) and proceeds re: disposal of Canvest, we believe Shanghai Industrial will be able to maintain at least a flat FY25E DPS of HK\\$0.94, implying a \\(6 - 7\\%\\) yield. Reflecting the latest market values of its listed subsidiaries, we raise our TP from HK\\$13.45 to HK\\$16.80, after applying the same target discount of \\(56\\%\\) (still \\(\\sim 1\\) S.D. discount to historical mean) and rolling our valuation to FY26E.

Contract sales in 1H25 was -RMB290m (with GFA of 13,400 sqm). Properties delivered in 1H25 mainly included Belle Rive in Qingpu, the Metropolis in Suzhou and Sea Palace in Quanzhou. Rental income was -RMB200m. By end-1H25, the company had five projects under construction with a combined area of -392,800 sqm. - Net loss for SI Urban Development amounted to HK$492m (vs. net loss of HK$232m in 1H24). The decline was mainly attributable to the decrease in gross profits from property sales. Contract sales fell 70% YoY to -RMB689m (with GFA of 41,000 sqm). Properties delivered amounted to -HK$1,349m with GFA of -57,000 sqm. They mainly included Ocean One in Shanghai, Summitopia in Tianjin, Felicity Mansion in Yantai, Ocean Times in Shanghai, Originally in Xi’an.

However, the profit contribution for the segment was largely flat YoY. - The Hangzhou Bay Bridge profit was no longer shared following the completion of the disposal of its equity interest by end-2024. - SIIIC Environment Holdings reported net profit of RMB344m (+7% YoY). The increase was primarily driven by its optimization of financing structure which resulted in a 12.5% YoY decrease in financial expenses. During 1H25, two sewage projects were secured with a planned treatment capacity of 60k tonnes per day and 25k tonnes per day respectively. An O&amp;amp;M project was commenced with a planned treatment capacity of 100k tonnes per day. Three upgrading and expansion projects were completed and commenced with a combined planned treatment capacity of 61k tonnes per day. An extension of existing project was granted with a planned treatment capacity of 80k tonnes per day.Consumer48541716%- Profit after tax of Nanyang Tobacco increased 20% YoY, mainly due to its 31% YoY increase in sales volume. This was partially offset by the YoY declined in sales in the duty-paid markets of Hong Kong and Macau. Purchase-curb policies imposed by customs also led to sales volumes decline in duty-free markets of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. - The profit of Wing Fat Printing increased 47% YoY, due to (i) streamlined business and cost structures, and (ii) improved operational efficiency at core factories.Core Operating Profit1,5562,519-38%Net Unallocated Corporate Income/ (Expense)13122488%Finance Costs(875)(1,030)-15%- Net debt ratio decreased to 60.99% (FY24: 65.12%)Share of Results of Associates and JCEs396497-20%Gain on disposal of subsidiaries/ interests in associates(43)52N/A- A loss of HK$56.84m was recorded as a result from the disposal of equity interest in Canvest Environmental in late May-25Profit before Taxation1,1652,059-43%Income Tax(377)(651)-42%Minority Interests254(208)N/AReported Profit1,0421,201-13%",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation.
