In terms of GMV, there is still a gap between MT and BABA in market share; (3) UE losses peaked for MT / BABA in Jul and both saw improvement in Aug vs Jul; (4) We factor in higher losses for QC (food and non- food) for MT/BABA in 3Q at (RMB17bn)/(RMB30bn) respectively; (5) We expect UE of BABA's QC to improve significantly in Sep and reduce by half after two months, thanks to user structure optimization, order mix and fulfillment efficiencies. AOV of BABA's food delivery is about 20% less vs MT with former's beverage volume less than 30% of total QC orders; (6) JD held up well in order volume in Jul vs Jun with emphasis on UE; (7) MT swung into a loss for food delivery in 2Q due to heightening competition in Jun is not expected by market, while BABA posted in- line in China ecommerce.",
