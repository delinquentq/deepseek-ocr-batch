Revenue growth was mixed across markets, with strong performance in Malaysia on the back of acquisitions, but challenges in other regions including Singapore which was impacted by the renovation of Mount Elizabeth hospital. Operating costs were roughly flat y- y, although staff cost as a share of revenue rose 1.1pp y- y and came in line with our expectation. The company's PATM of MYR443mn showed a \\(29\\%\\) y- y decline coming in \\(17\\%\\) below our expectation, while PATM, excluding exceptional items and the impact of MFRS129, was MYR518m, down \\(9\\%\\) y- y and \\(3\\%\\) below our forecast and below consensus. Key exceptional items included: (1) an MYR15mn gain from exchange difference on net borrowings; and (2) a MYR15mn net monetary gain from a hyperinflationary economy.",

We expect the EBITDA margin pressure to continue in the near term, as: (1) IHH's key Singapore business has been impacted by the renovation of Mount Elizabeth and pressure from payors to tamp down on medical inflation. While the renovation has been completed and the hospital is expected to ramp up by 3Q25E, we understand that management expects full occupancy only by 2Q26F, which could prevent meaningful margin expansion. (2) IHH and other major private hospital operators continue to face payor pressure in Singapore and Malaysia due to the high medical inflation. In Singapore, the company is increasing its focus on day care (day surgeries) and using its ambulatory care centers (ACC) to decant patients. This is also expected to result in lower capex requirements in the longer term and a faster payback period, in our view. In Malaysia, IHH is working with partners to give discounts wherever appropriate and has concluded negotiations with most payors. We believe these measures should help prevent any significant increase in revenue intensity and be a headwind for margin growth.",

In the medium term, we expect rising revenue intensity in all of its home markets due to the company's proactive investments in technologies such as robotic surgeries, hybrid operating rooms and telemedicines. We believe these investments should help IHH's hospitals differentiate themselves from peers, and help them attract medical travelers and facilitate more complex and revenue-intensive surgeries. However, we are concerned about the margin pressure for the company's Singapore, Malaysia and Turkey businesses and maintain our Neutral rating.",
