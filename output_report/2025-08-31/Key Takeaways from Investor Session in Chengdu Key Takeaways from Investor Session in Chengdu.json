Kling highlights that video generation models are a huge market, as demonstrated by multiple players entering the sector. There are still many areas that can be enhanced to satisfy user needs. Kling focuses on (a) technology; and (b) product innovation amid focused strategy. It is a tier 1 player in the video generation model and considers there to be three stages of R&D: (1) authentic visual effects; (2) controllability; (3) customization of characters. Kling focuses on the first two at the moment and aims to enable users to be video directors. On iterations, it is based on user feedback, and monetization should be enhanced by the upgrade. The addressable market is USD140bn, among which AI is expected to penetrate USD20- 30bn in three years' time. In the future, AI is expected to penetrate as much as \\(50\\%\\) of the market. Kling has good model performance, which is key to user engagement. Overseas users have better paying behavior. It will step up the effects in localization to satisfy needs across various countries.",
