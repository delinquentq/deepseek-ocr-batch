The non- manufacturing PMI edged up to 50.3 in August from 50.1 in July, slightly above consensus (Consensus: 50.2; Nomura: 50.0). Despite the marginal rise, the manufacturing PMI has remained below 50 for five months since the tariff blitz in April, with persistent weakness in new export orders. Meanwhile, the continued rise in the price indices reflects the intensifying campaign against low- price competition, which could dampen investment and output activity. The improvement in the non- manufacturing PMI was primarily driven by capital market services, buoyed by the recent stock market rally, while retail sales and property sectors have remained a drag.",

While the stock market rally has gained momentum, its spillover effects on the real economy may be limited, as household wealth is still concentrated in property, and financial sector compensation remains largely capped. The rising growth headwinds call for more policy support, but deploying pro- growth measures might risk causing a stock market bubble. In our view, Beijing's best strategy is to draw lessons from the past, resist the temptation to fuel the stock markets by avoiding too high- profile monetary measures in the near term, remain vigilant by avoiding contractionary policies, clean up the property mess, and address some deep- rooted problems, such as the unequal social security system.",
