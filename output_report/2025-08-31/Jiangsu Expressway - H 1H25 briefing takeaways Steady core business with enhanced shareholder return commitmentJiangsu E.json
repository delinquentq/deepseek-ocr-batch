Jiangsu Exy- H's share price has decreased by \\(c17\\%\\) since mid- June (vs the HSI index's \\(+5\\%\\) during the same period), reflecting market sentiment towards growth names. Following the recent share price correction, Jiangsu Exy- H's dividend yield is around \\(5.6\\%\\) , which remains attractive for quality yield name investors, in our view. Stay OW.",

However, starting in May 2025, the province has extended the \\(15\\%\\) tariff discount to all China's trucks, but this discount now applies only to smaller roads. This change means that Jiangsu Exy's key asset, the Shanghai- Nanjing Exy, no longer needs to offer the \\(15\\%\\) tariff discount to trucks.

Jiangsu Exy has expanded into the new energy sector as an additional growth avenue, with the YS Energy acquisition profit- and value- accretive. Jiangsu Exy has kept a steady payout since listing, a very strong track record in the sector. For Chinese tollroads, we see rising visibility for meaningful concession extensions (up to 40 years) as well as prospective tariff hikes, as affirmed by our recent discussions with the listed Chinese tollroad operators, as all of them are in the process of changing their capital allocation plans, with an apparent pick- up in interest in reinvesting back into their existing tollroad assets in a bid for concession extension.",
