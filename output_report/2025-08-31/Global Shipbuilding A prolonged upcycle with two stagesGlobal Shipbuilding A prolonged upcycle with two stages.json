Historically, share prices are mainly driven by orderbook backlog; but also by earnings beats, as orderbooks determine revenue while earnings depend on cost/efficiency, especially considering orderbooks are capacity- constrained now. Hence, we do not think the current orderbooks fairly reflect value, and expect earnings outperformance benefiting from high- ASP orderbooks and low steel prices, could drive share prices.

For Chinese shipyards specifically, the orderbook is capped by the capacity and not the demand, hence we do not think the current orderbooks fairly reflect their long- term competitiveness and value. Historically, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding's share price declined from Apr- 2015 with the decline in orderbook backlog, but started rebounding from Oct- 2016 on strong earnings expectation from the delivery of high- value large containerships. We expect a similar situation this time with our 26/27E earnings 26- 39% above consensus (LSEG Data & Analytics) for Yangzijiang. On the other hand, Chinese shipyards' share price has been underperforming Korean peers, mainly due to the market expectation that USTR's higher port service fees on China- built vessels would structurally make Chinese shipyards continuously lose market share going forward, and Korean shipyards may also benefit from potential newbuild and Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) orders from the US Navy (Ensuring Naval Readiness Act and Ensuring Coast Guard Readiness Act, released on February 5th, 2025, allowing the US to acquire ships from allied nations). However, as highlighted above, we believe the impact from USTR's fees on China- built vessels is limited, and China will gain back market share gradually from 2026E onwards. All in, we believe Chinese shipyards would have higher upside vs. global peers. Specifically, for our covered Chinese name Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, which has the lowest P/B vs. the highest ROE with the highest dividend yield among global peers.",

In 2025, we expect the new order volume to sharply decline, by \\(44\\%\\) YoY, given the declining profitability of major downstream sub- segments, container shipping and LNG carriers; and uncertainty around the trade outlook amid tariff tension. From 2026- 27E, we believe the containerships would still be a major contributor to the new ship orders, considering the demand for smaller and middle- size containerships has been driven higher by the shipping alliance reshuffling, exemption of USTR fees (see our note) for small vessels with capacity below 4,000 TEU or 55,000 DWT. From 2028E, we believe tankers and bulkers would begin to make up a larger proportion of new ship orders, driven by replacement demand as the fleet ages, and due to the global push for decarbonization.

Our correlation analysis shows that the global newbuild price is highly correlated (R- square \\(>90\\%\\) ) with the orderbook forward cover years.
