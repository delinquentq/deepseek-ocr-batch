Key takeaways: (1) Management reiterated its 350K EV shipment target by enhancing production efficiency. July EV shipments exceeded 30k, and August, it expects, will be higher than July. (2) Solid EV GM was driven by supply chain and higher ASP/product mix in 2Q. (3) 3Q25 IoT sales could decline QoQ on seasonality and subsidy patterns. (4) SEA is a high- potential market for the IoT business. (5) AI Glasses sales are better than expected, with upside to shipments. (6) 3Q25 smartphone GM is under pressure but 4Q will rebound, per mgmt. (6) Majority of overseas new retail stores setup in SE A currently. Maintain Buy. Near- term catalysts: Mi 16 launch, ramping EV deliveries/orders, new EV edition updates.",

July EV shipments exceeded 30k, and August will be higher than July, per mgmt. The order conversion from SU7 to YU7 is limited, less than 15%. Despite long lead time of YU7, cancellations are limited. The company is also making attempts to filter out scalpers. The strong GM of 26.4% for EV/Al+ segment was driven by supply- chain management, product mix improvement, higher ASP, high option rate etc. Currently, SU7 and YU7 users are mostly single drivers with an average age in the 30- ish; future models aim to expand the customer segment.

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"-\" respectively in the rating history price",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note.
