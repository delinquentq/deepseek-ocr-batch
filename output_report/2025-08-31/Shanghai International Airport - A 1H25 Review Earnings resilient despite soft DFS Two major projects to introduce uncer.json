We maintain our Neutral rating on SHIA due to its current business structure, which is less robust compared to pre- pandemic levels, while valuation remains higher than that of its Asian peers. Additionally, with the two major projects (SHIA's Phase IV expansion and Nantong New Airport) gradually unfolding, the introduction of new capacity may heighten competition and diminish SHIA's operational efficiency over the medium term.",

According to Shanghai City government news, in July 2025, the comprehensive construction of the Phase IV expansion project commenced. This includes the steady progress of Terminal 3 and the advancement of the international main building to the 6-meter structural level. The capex involved is substantial, and the parent company is primarily handling this project. It remains uncertain whether the listed company will participate, although SHIA management has not ruled out the possibility. Currently, Pudong Airport operates with four runways, two terminals, and one satellite terminal, designed to accommodate an annual passenger throughput of 80MM. Hongqiao Airport operates with two runways and two terminals, with designed passenger throughput of 40MM. The new Phase IV expansion will bring in an additional designed capacity of 50MM.",

However, the project has not yet commenced, and the capital expenditure could be substantial. It remains uncertain whether SHIA (the listco) will participate in the construction.
