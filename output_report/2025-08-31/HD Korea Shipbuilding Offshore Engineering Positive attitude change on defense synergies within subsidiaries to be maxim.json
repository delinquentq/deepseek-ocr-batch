      "text": "We raise our Dec- 26 PT for KSOE to W510K from W460K to reflect our upward revised PTs for HD Hyundai Heavy and HD Hyundai Mipo- driven by heightened visibility for navy orders. The merger announced recently by the group clearly shows a change of attitude towards the defense business, in our view, for which the company has been relatively more conservative vs. peers. We expect to see more investments with regards to capacity in the US and overseas to well capture the global navy opportunities (link to report). The merger also allows the group to 1) fully utilize key assets/resources (including labor) and capacity for future orders, 2) centralize and heighten efficiency for overseas shipyards that were previously dispersed under different companies. We expect the group's navy related sales (from HHI) to amount to W8.7T by 2030, deeming the group's guidance of W7T as conservative, with OP coming in at W0.8T - margin accretive orders coming from global ex- US orders which should be built domestically.",

Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.",
