Though the momentum seems to be softening a bit in the past few months, the stimulus policies probably will re- accelerate in 4Q25, per our macro team's expectations. Among Taiwan automation names, we prefer Airtac over Hiwin. Airtac should continue to see share gains and broader product offerings, with an undemanding valuation at 17x 2026e P/E (vs. mid- cycle average of 25x). Hiwin's fundamentals remain lukewarm while valuation looks hefty at 32x 2026e P/E now ( \\(\\sim\\) 25D above its mid- cycle average).",
