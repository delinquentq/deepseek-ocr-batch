      "text": "- According to CRIC, contract sales volume growth for the top 100 developers worsened again, declining to -31.2% y-o-y in August from -18.6% in July. In value terms, it improved to -17.6% y-o-y in August from -24.3% in July.- The divergence between volume and value terms points to better performance in large cities, driven by easing measures.- On 8 August, Beijing relaxed home purchase restrictions by allowing qualified buyers to acquire additional properties in areas beyond the Fifth Ring.- Subsequently, on 26 August, Shanghai announced a cut in mortgage rates for second homes and an easing in home buying rules outside the Outer Ring.- We expect other tier-1 cities such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou to implement similar supportive measures.- However, we believe the most effective way to clear up the property sector mess is to address developers' debt overhang and provide funding to deliver the presold homes.- As property remains the dominant asset class in Chinese household portfolios, a recovery in the property market would be more meaningful for economic growth than the current stock market rally.",
