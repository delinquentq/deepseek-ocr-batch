Titagarh is also the lowest bidder (L1) for Mumbai Line 5 (link), where a firm order for 132 coaches is yet to be placed. As there have been design configuration changes for Vande Bharat, from 16- coach to 24- coach train configuration at the behest of IR, we have pushed out the expected delivery of the first train, from June 25 to Mar- 26 (1,280 coaches), in line with guidance. We assume execution of 126, 304 & 392 coaches in F26, F27 & F28e, implying passenger contribution to EBIT rises from 3% in F25 to 4.0% in F28e.",

Freight is a larger business (82% of F26e EBIT), and hence EPS sensitivity is higher on EPS F26- 28e. 2) We forecast a 24% EPS CAGR, F26- 28e. Our revised PT is Rs1,017 (previously: Rs1,027), which implies 23% upside; the stock trades at 26x F27e. Our valuation methodology (30x PER on Sept 2027) remains unchanged.

It aims to nearly double its capability in metro product variants (from 22 to 41); for propulsion, it has a strategic intent to triple its offering (from 10 to 31 variants). These are to be developed from F27e onward, with an objective to offer a complete product range and leverage opportunities in domestic as well as exports. Given Indian Railways' focus on rail safety and signaling, Titagarh is setting up a new vertical, and it has identified three key areas - viz., safety, signaling, systems (SSS), and engineering capabilities (train control, asset condition monitoring, vehicular and train mounted solutions). Given limited competition (in passenger coaches) at this juncture, with the industry dominated by Alstom, BEML, and Titagarh, we believe Titagarh remains well placed to tap opportunities supported by strong rolling stock capex.",
