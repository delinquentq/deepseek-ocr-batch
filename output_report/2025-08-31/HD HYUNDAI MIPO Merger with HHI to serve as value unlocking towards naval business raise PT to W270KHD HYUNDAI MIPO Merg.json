      "text": "We raise our Dec- 26 PT for Hyundai Mipo (Mipo) to W270K (from W250K). HD Heavy Group announced it will merge HHI with Mipo, allowing the Mipo docks to be used for US navy fleet production (with HHI's license). The company will also transition 2 docks out of 4 for naval fleet construction use, which could add 6 additional navy fleet annual capacity, tapping into the global navy market (link to report). Mipo was considered to have relatively less navy exposure compared to HHI/KSOE and Hanwha Ocean, but with the merger, we expect to see positive share price momentum from ample navy related catalysts ahead. Moreover, with the merger ratio set at 1:0.4 (HHI:Mipo), we think positive navy business development at HHI should also lead to similar price movement for Mipo, with potential market arbitrage trade between the two stocks. After a shareholders' meeting to approve the merger on \\(23^{\\text{rd}}\\) October, the effective date of merger will be on \\(1^{\\text{st}}\\) December. With Mipo's new exposure to the navy business, we raise our target price orderbook multiple to 0.6x (from 0.5x) and raise our PT accordingly to W270K. Maintain OW.",
