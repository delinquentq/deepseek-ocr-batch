This suggests continued decent production expansion. Demand conditions improved modestly, but remained relatively weak. Both input (to 53.3) and output (to 49.1) price components rose further, reflecting anti- involution efforts and incomplete cost transmission. Manufacturing future output PMI rose another 1.1pts to 53.7, indicating increased confidence, especially in general equipment and aerospace. Construction PMI fell another 1.5pts on lingering weather drags, while services PMI hit a ytd high of 50.5, boosted by capital markets and tourism.

Key supply and demand components of the manufacturing PMI showed modest gains, including output (+0.3pt), new orders (0.1pt) and new export orders (0.1pt), partially offsetting the easing observed in July. The output component (50.8) stayed above the 50- threshold, though a touch below the June print (51.0), suggesting a continuation of decent industrial production expansion. However, demand conditions remained relatively weak, with both orders metrics below the 50- threshold. By sector, the pharmaceuticals and telecom sectors significantly outperformed, while both supply and demand for the textiles and chemicals sectors remained contractionary. Employment PMI stayed subdued, with a 0.1pt downtic to 48.0, reflecting ongoing weakness in the labor market.",

Input prices PMI rose another 1.8pts to 53.3, building on the 3.1- point rise in July, driven by improved price conditions in the ferrous metal smelting/processing and metal products sectors. Output prices PMI also rose 0.8pt, but remained in contractionary territory at 49.1. This likely reflects recent anti- involution efforts in some upstream sectors, as well as incomplete cost transmission from inputs to outputs and persistent demand weakness. The manufacturing future output PMI climbed by 1.1pts to 53.7, signaling growing confidence among manufacturers, particularly in sectors such as general equipment, railway, shipbuilding, and aerospace equipment (above 58).",

Meanwhile, services PMI rose 0.5pt to 50.5, marking its highest level year- to- date.

      "text": "The August PMI report aligns with our forecast of a modest improvement in domestic activities for the month, while anti- involution efforts and weather- related impacts may have lingered. Our baseline forecast anticipates a slowdown in growth momentum in 2H, with growth drivers rotating from external to domestic demand. Net exports underpinned the 1H growth resilience, but their contribution is expected to wane as export front- loading unwinds and transshipment impulses fade. In contrast, domestic demand is expected to bear more of the burden. Recent data, however, suggests that this shift is occurring, albeit to a lesser extent than initially anticipated. Exports fell less than expected in July and alt- data suggests some recovery in August, underpinned by non- US market demand. Next Monday's RatingDog PMI (covering more export- oriented firms) may provide more colour on export new orders conditions. July retail sales and investment were weaker than expected, but we expect both to improve modestly. Trade- in subsidies are being used, and the deployment of government bond proceeds can switch focus to new projects instead of debt repayment. However, the NBS construction PMI suggests weather effects remained as a drag. We believe anti- involution efforts will continue to weigh on investment and production in sectors with over- capacity, but those efforts will be data- dependent and not overly aggressive, in our view. The NBS manufacturing output PMI suggests solid production expansion in August, anchoring our 3Q GDP growth forecast tracking. Demand- side dynamics will determine the extent to which inventories build up and, thus, deflation pressure. Overall, our forecast for 3Q growth to slow to \\(3\\% \\mathrm{q} / \\mathrm{q}\\) saar remains on track.",
