With unemployment remaining high and layoffs seen across industries, the ongoing protests risk further hurting consumer and business sentiment. Big companies are unlikely to spend much on capex in 2H25, based on our channel checks. However, fiscal spending is set to accelerate, focusing on social programs, while Bl could cut rates (3 x 25bps) through January 2026, according to our economist. Danantara's Rp50trn (US\\(3.1bn) Patriot Bond program aims at attracting offshore Indonesian money to fund domestic energy and AI projects, incentivizing it with tax amnesty. We maintain our cautious view on the market, preferring defensives BBCA, GOTO, BRIS, ASII, ICBP, and commodity names MDKA and ADMR given the market's relatively low valuation of 11.5x forward P/E.",

Rp50m/month) that is being perceived by protesters as lavish. The tragic death of a delivery rider in Jakarta further escalated nationwide protests. In Greater Jakarta, protesters stormed government buildings and ransacked three parliament members' houses as well as that of Finance Minister Sri Muljani over the weekend. While markets reacted on Friday to the protests, with the Jakarta Composite Index sliding 1.5- 2.3%, the rupiah weakening 0.8- 0.9% and bond yields widening, we believe negative reactions will persist near- term.",

The unemployment rate is rising and hiring remains concentrated in informal, low- quality roles, particularly outside modern sectors. Fixed manufacturing jobs are in decline, shedding more than 42,000 positions in 1H25, signaling in our view de- industrialization and weaker wage growth. The protests risk further hurting consumer and business confidence, potentially weighing on retail sales, lending, and private- sector investment. The middle- class - already suffering from inflation and job insecurity - appears increasingly squeezed. Our conversations with Indonesian corporates suggest that they remain cautious and are unlikely to meaningfully expand capex in the medium- term.",

ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of \\(15\\%\\) or more or \\(25\\%\\) or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Rating Suspended\" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign \"Under Review\" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as \"—\" and \"–\" respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned \"Under Review\" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.",

A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period.

The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note.

For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution- disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation.

Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non- fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re- instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long- term or short- term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.",

The securities of non- U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for exact dividend computations.
