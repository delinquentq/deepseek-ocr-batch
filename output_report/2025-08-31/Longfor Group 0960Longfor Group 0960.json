      "text": "For investors who want to play a medium- term turnaround story among non- SOE Chinese developers, we believe Longfor remains the best candidate with favourable risk- reward, because: 1) default risk is low with a comfortable balance sheet; 2) recurring net income of Rmb8- 9bn provides a solid buffer; 3) management remains one of the more capital- market- friendly ones (peers such as Vanke & Seazen no longer host result briefings, while Longfor not only hosts a results call, but also remains active in roadshows & conferences). Tactically, if there is significant policy easing in the housing market, we believe Longfor may offer \\(>70\\%\\) upside if we simply benchmark to the peak in October 2024. However, even if we assume 'no big policy', we believe Longfor may still retare gradually to \\(\\sim \\mathrm{HK}\\) 14 (33% potential upside) in the medium term, if we apply a 10x P/E to recurring (non- DP) net income (assuming zero value from DP). From a trading perspective, we also observe Longfor seems to have found a solid support level at \\(>HK\\) 9.",

      "text": "A transformation in the making: Longfor's earlier strategy of actively building recurring income is paying off amid the current industry backdrop, as Longfor has been able to raise commercial property loans & long- term rental loans (latest balance: Rmb93bn), which have much longer tenure ( \\(>10\\) years) and lower financing costs ( \\(3 - 4\\%\\) ) to repay bonds. We estimate Longfor still has capacity to raise another Rmb10- 15bn, which can cover the outstanding balance of offshore bonds (Rmb9.5bn). Meanwhile, the Rmb8.0- 8.5bn FY25E net profit from recurring income (likely Rmb10bn in a few years' time) helps offset the earnings dilution from DP. Over the next few years, we expect Longfor to transform from a DP- focused developer into a recurring income- focused asset manager (Figure 6).",

From an earnings perspective, we think the worst is not over. We forecast FY25E core net profit to drop \\(80\\%\\) Y/Y to Rmb1.4bn (implying almost no profit in 2H25E) (Figure 1), as the low- margin DP projects ( \\(0 - 1\\%\\) gross margin) will still drag down overall earnings (we forecast recurring net profit to be Rmb8.0- 8.5bn in FY25E, implying a net loss of Rmb6.6- 7.1bn from DP). However, we expect earnings to rebound in FY26E and FY27E, and although the low- margin projects may remain dilutive (Figure 2), we believe the impact on overall earnings should start to ease.",

In 1H25, Longfor reported positive OCF (including capex) of Rmb2bn+, and we forecast Longfor will achieve positive OCF of ~Rmb10bn in FY25E (Table 1) as long as Longfor remains inactive in land-banking. In our stress test, to ensure OCF does not turn negative, Longfor's monthly contracted sales in 2H25E need to be >Rmb5bn (or higher than a 39% Y/Y decline), which we believe is manageable. That said, if sales momentum turns out to be much worse than expected, we cannot rule out the possibility of share placement (after all, Longfor is one of the few non-distressed POE developers which have not raised funds through share placement since the liquidity crisis began in 2021).",

The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
