Stripping out mainly the asset disposal gain in 1H24, recurrent earnings increased \\(31.8\\%\\) yoy (a beat; outpacing Mengniu's up \\(12.2\\%\\) yoy). Raw milk cost declined \\(2.5\\%\\) from Jan to Jun, and 1H25 average cost was down \\(12\\%\\) yoy.

With IMF sales up DD (vs Mengniu up \\(2.5\\%\\) and Feihe down \\(9\\%\\) ), Yili is now ranked #1 in terms of IMF retail market share in China. Given the better-than- expected 1H25 results, Yili maintained its 2025 full- year target (announced at year- beginning) of sales up \\(2.8\\%\\) (vs Mengniu down mid- high- single- digit) with a \\(9\\%\\) net margin (up from 2024's adjusted net margin of \\(8.2\\%\\) ). We maintain our 2025 sales/adjusted earnings forecasts of \\(+2.9\\% / + 20.6\\%\\) yoy, and our OW rating with a PT of Rmb35. Yili remains our top pick in our China dairy coverage.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe.
