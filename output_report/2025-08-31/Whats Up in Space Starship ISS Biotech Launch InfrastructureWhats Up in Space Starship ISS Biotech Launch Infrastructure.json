The ascent appeared successful excluding the premature shutdown of one of 33 Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster, with the Starship reaching its planned suborbital trajectory. The mission also included the deployment of eight mass simulators of next- gen Starlink satellites. Starship had a successful controlled reentry to its targeted splashdown zone in the Indian Ocean.",

Current named customers include Xona Space Systems, Albedo, JAXA/Mitsui Bussan Aerospace of Japan and ESA/European Defense Agencies. Aerospacelab is differentiating through designing and producing subsystems in- house and leveraging commercial off- the- shelf components to cut costs and lead times. Aerospacelab has deployed nine satellites to date. Aerospacelab has been shortlisted to build \\(>290\\) mostly LEO satellites by SpaceX/ISE (EC backed consortium of SES, Eutelsat, and Hispasa) with a target service date of 2031.

Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.",
