Given the local assets of ODM were settled on Jul 2 and oversea assets will also be settled soon, mgt expected to reverse the corresponding losses in Q3-4 on PnL, which was estimated to be Rmb200-400m.",

Specifically, auto rev in China grew &gt;40% YoY. As a leading international power/analog semi player, Wingtech has been accelerating new product R&D and launch. The latest gen of MOS products are manufactured in Lingang 12-inch fab with significant improvements in performance and cost,which have successfully obtained design winds of leading domestic EV customers and are expected to start mass production and shipment from Oct. Mgt also indicated it has secured orders for SiC MOS and IGBT products from domestic EV customers as well with deliveries expected to begin in 2H25, and its HV GaN products have already been adopted by multiple OEMs including Geely and Renault. In addition, datacom is another key area to develop. Mgt suggested its power/analog products have been widely adopted in AI server and data center,and is now actively sending new samples to ODM and power supply vendors, which could potentially become another important growth curve in coming years.",

Although forgoing ODM business theoretically means a lower ceiling for the company's size in long-term, by focusing its resources more efficiently on semi going forward, we think Wingtech has opportunity to deliver better than expected profit which still depends on mgt's execution ability. We maintain BUY with uCIF-based PT of Rmb49.80 (WACC 10.0%, terminal growth rate 5.3%), which implies 33%/21x 2025E/26E P/E and suggests 15% potential upside.",
