The company recorded sales/net profit of Rmb6,206mn/Rmb823mn, respectively in 1H25 (- 19%/- 29% yoy), with NP decline fall into lower- end of its profit alert range at 20- 30% decline. Specifically, packaged water sales were down 23% in 1H25 lagging behind market expectation, mainly on a - 26% decline in small- sized drinking water(c.51% of total revenue) and a 19% decline in Medium to large- sized water amid intense market competition. Beverage sales were up 21% in 1H25 (also lower than expected), reaching 15.4% of total sales in 1H25 (vs. 10.3% in 2024) with its diversified new SKUs launches. The GPM was down - 2.6ppt yoy (slightly above GSe by 1.0ppt), with volume deleveraging/mix shift offsetting cost tailwinds and company's cost control measure across value chain. Selling expenses were down 10% with ratios to 30.4%, up by 2.9ppt/ due to operating deleveraging, while admin exp (excl. listing fee) remained largely steady. OPM contracted by 5.3ppt (0.4ppt lower vs. GSe), while NPM was down 1.9ppt with help of higher interest income and lower effective tax rate. Interim dividend: the company announced its interim dividend plan of Rmb0.118/shr or a total of Rmb283mn, implying a c.34% payout ratio.",

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
