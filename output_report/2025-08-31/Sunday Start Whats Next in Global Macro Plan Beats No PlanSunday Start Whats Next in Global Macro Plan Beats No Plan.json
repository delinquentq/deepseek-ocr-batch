Until Chair Powell's speech at Jackson Hole, we saw the Fed's reaction function overweighting the risks from above- target and now rising inflation. After all, inflation has stayed above \\(2\\%\\) for more than four years, and even though nonfarm payrolls and underlying aggregate demand have clearly slowed, the unemployment rate remains roughly unchanged from a year earlier at \\(4.2\\%\\) . The economy is essentially operating at the Fed's estimate of full employment.",

It now leans toward managing the risk of a bigger slowdown and is more willing to live with the threat of higher inflation.",

And they still expect curve steepening, especially with the Fed's increased comfort in cutting rates despite inflationary pressures. We continue to expect a weaker US dollar because we see more policy rate- gasing from the Fed than from other central banks, among other factors.

In our dialogue with clients, many argue that if such risks materialize, a policy response would be likely, and we agree. Our rates strategy colleagues in particular have highlighted the scope the Treasury has already acknowledged to adjust issuance patterns in response to market pricing. But from a trading perspective, we think it's important to keep in mind that these moves are likely to be reactive, not proactive.
