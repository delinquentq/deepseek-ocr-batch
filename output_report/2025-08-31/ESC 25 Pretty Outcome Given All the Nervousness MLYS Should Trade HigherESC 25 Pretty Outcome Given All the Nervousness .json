Placebo was -5.8 mmHg, which actually looked better than MLYS' Phase III LAUNCH and way lower than CINC's Phase II's BrigHTN ~8-11 mmHg placebo effect. As we've noted (here), we view a ~2-point difference in BP to be similar and, relative to LAUNCH, anything between 9.7-13.7 mmHg should be similar (AZN had 9.8 mmHg so on the lower booked of the range). We think most docs will view both drugs as similar, but optically MLYS can obviously market its drug as having better BP reduction and AZN will also need to work through the psychology of having efficacy &lt;10 mmHg i.e. less than double digit BP efficacy.",

Patients &gt;6.0mmol/L were also higher for AZN at 3% vs MLYS 1.1%. But in terms of confirmed hyperkalemia, AZN only reported rates &gt;6.0mmol/L,which was also numerically higher than MLYS' (1.1% vs 0.6%). Our view is - AZN has slightly worse higher rates of hyperkalemia though % rates are confounded by very small N. For example and important context, if there was one fewer patient out of N=263 in the confirmed&gt;6.0 mmol/L for AZN's 2mg dose, hyperkalemia rates would've been N=2/263 = 0.76% i.e. in line with MLYS' 50mg dose in LAUNCH. Thus, we wouldn't read too much into the hyperkalemia signals and view both as similar given the small N.",
