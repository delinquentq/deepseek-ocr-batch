ASP is estimated to be RMB 167k for the quarter (-2.1% yoy and +7.3% qoq), as Tank and WEY brands mix reached 26%(vs. 27% in Q2 24 and 22% in Q1 25). Great Wall recorded 18.8% gross margin in Q2 25,-165bps lower vs. Q2 24 and +96bps vs. Q1 25, primarily due to lower mix of Tank and Pick-up compared to prior year, and lower overseas margin (i.e. Russia saw c.3-4% margin erosion from scrappage tax policy). Operating profit reached RMB 5.1bn with 9.8% margin in Q2 25, vs. 9.2% in Q2 24 and 4.3% in Q1 25 driven by increased government subsidies in the quarter. Stripping out the RMB 2.2bn of government grants, operating margin would have been 5.5% for Q2 25. Net income was RMB 4.6bn, +19.4% yoy and +161.9% qoq, implying 8.8% margin, or 4.5% excluding government grant, vs. 7.9% in Q2 24 and 4.4% in Q1 25.",

The company is confidently targeting 40%+ HoH growth in H2, which we think is achievable based on recent traction.
