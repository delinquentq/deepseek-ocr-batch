With strong profit delivery, Jiangxi Copper has proven itself to continue to benefit from its self- supplied copper concentrate from its mines in Jiangxi, and less affected by its smelting business under depressed TCRC. As a pure copper play, we expect net profit to increase from RMB6.90bn in 2024 to RMB9.18bn in 2025E and RMB9.52bn in 2026E, driven by rising copper price. The H- share valuation remains attractive, trading at 8x PE for 2025E, versus its historical range of 5- 10x.

Major end- markets of copper include the electricity grid, appliances, machinery and EVs. With strong profit delivery, Jiangxi Copper has proven itself to continue to benefit from its self- supplied copper concentrate from its mines in Jiangxi, and less affected by its smelting business under depressed TCRC. As a pure copper play, we expect net profit to increase from Rmb6.90bn in 2024 to Rmb9.18bn in 2025E and Rmb9.52bn in 2026E, driven by rising copper price. The H- share valuation looks attractive by trading at 8x PE for 2025E, versus its historical range of 5- 10x. We maintain our Buy ratings on Jiangxi Copper- H/A.",

The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
