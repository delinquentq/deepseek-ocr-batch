Potential higher sales in 2H25E partly from inventory in 1H25, and stabilized spot price provides additional support at the bottom. The outlook on coal price has incrementally improved, in the context of the ongoing supply work supporting more stabilized domestic coal prices in 2026E- 2027E, versus the declining trend at prior course. For the seaborne market, GSe global team expect seaborne thermal coal and met coal prices to change in the range of \\(- 7\\%\\) to \\(+12\\%\\) in 2H25E- 2027E versus 1H25A, segments that contribute \\(31\\%\\) of the self- mined coal volume for Yankuang.

Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early- Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage. The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.",
