As a result, our assumption for the VR200 rack overall PSU content is for an increase from US\\$67k in our previous report (here) to US\\$104k now due to the increase in the AI server ship TDP (assuming it's a NVL72 design), which suggests a much more favorable demand/TAM outlook for Delta, as we believe the VR200 rack will use the 18kW PSU, and this product will be supplied solely by Delta in 2026- 28, despite the possible share losing risk in 5.5kW PSU from 2026.",

It is also a key supplier for the EV/server power industry, holding one of the largest market shares in both markets. We are positive on Delta's long- term growth opportunity driven by multiple factors (EV/EV charger/5G infrastructure/Datacenter power/ESS etc.) in the coming years. We also expect demand for its AI server power and cooling systems to deliver solid growth, considering the increasing demand for high computing performance AI servers, which will require higher power efficiency power components and better cooling systems to improve the overall performance. Trading at a 1- year forward P/E multiple that is below our target multiple, we believe the stock is undervalued, given the company's strong revenue outlook (20%+ 2023E- 30E CAGR) for its growth sectors (including EV & EV charging / green capex & renewable energy / cloud computing / smart manufacturing / satellite communication & smart connectivity), and its leadership in the power component industry. We are Buy rated. Key downside risks include: (1) slower than expected AI server power consumption growth momentum, (2) potential market share loss risk in AI server DC- DC power system or the potential design change on AI server DC- DC system, and (3) sharper NT\\$ appreciation against USD.",
