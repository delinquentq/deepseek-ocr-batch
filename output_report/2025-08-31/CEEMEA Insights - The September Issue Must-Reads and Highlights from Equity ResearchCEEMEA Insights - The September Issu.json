Concerns about competition eroding profitability have subsided across our coverage; however our analysis suggests that the Street is not pricing in higher cost of space expansion, particularly for Dino (N).CEEMEA FinancialsMehmet Sevim, BaronNkomo, Filippo MunariOW: Discovery (+CW), OTP, SNBThe operating backdrop remains generally supportive for banks across CEEMEA, with solid loan growth, careful monetary policy easing, robust capital generation, and higher-than-normal ROTEs. Greece and UAE are our preferred regions, while political risks have increased in CEE, notably in Poland. The outlook is improving into 2H for Turkish banks and, in South Africa, we expect positive earnings growth and solid ROEs. For Saudi banks, the investment case remains less intuitive, and we remain selective.CEEMEA Petrochemicals &amp;amp; FertilizersAlex Comer, Jarryd ThomasOW: Advanced PetrochemicalUW: SABIC Agri-NWe are witnessing the most extended slump in the petrochemical industry in 40 years. Without China following through on capacity rationalization, the supply/demand dynamics are unlikely to improve in the medium term. On fertilizers, urea prices remain high and supply/demand dynamics indicate structural tightening ahead given limited capacity additions and geopolitical risks. Longer term, we do not anticipate that the urea market will get sustainably tight enough to offset declines in EU gas prices.CEEMEA Metals &amp;amp; MiningDominic O&#x27;Kane, PatrickJones, Anna AntonovaOW: AngloGold, Glencore,KazatompromInto H2, we expect modest downside risks to copper prices driven by unwind of US inventory and slowdown post H1 frontloading. We view this as a near-term headwind rather than structural, and we favour names with compelling fundamentals, including Antofagasta (OW, AFL). On iron ore, we forecast $100/t for through H2 with the downside risk relating to economic slowdown and any steel output cuts in China. We stay positive on gold miners and are OW AngloGold, Fresnillo &amp;amp; Hochschild.Türkiye Consumer &amp;amp; IndustrialsHanzade KilickiranOW: Ford Otosan, Turkish AirlinesWe expect two key themes to unfold in Turkish equities in H2: a declining cost of capital attracts more interest in equities and slower domestic consumption prompts selectivity. We favour turnaround stories such as Ford Otosan (OW) and Arcelik (OW), as well as value stocks like Turkish Airlines (OW). For food retail, the consumption slowdown, lower food inflation and promotional activity challenge revenue and profitability while, in Staples, a lack of catalysts could hold back multiples for a few more quarters.MENA ConsumerElena Jounovova, TaherSafieddineOW: Americana RestaurantsUW: AlothaimWe anticipate improved consumer spending in H2, driven by post summer economic activity, stable inflation, and social/economic initiatives. We expect Almarai (OW) to deliver strong top-line growth, while post boycott demand recovery should support Americana (OW). In food delivery, Jahez (UW) may struggle with growth without reinvesting profits and developing e-grocery, while Talabat (OW) is poised to maintain market leadership and cash generation with a conservative profitability outlook.MENA Industrials &amp;amp; UtilitiesAnna AntonovaOW: ADNOC Logistics &amp;amp; Services,EmpowerWith regional PMIs remaining healthy and absent any geopolitical shocks, we expect focus to shift towards high quality cyclical names, such as ADNOC L&amp;amp;S (OW). That said, there are still lingering risks for the global Shipping and Logistics sectors, including Red Sea disruptions and the sanctions environment, with the freight backdrop likely to remain volatile. In our view, the expected H2 Fed rate cut(s) should benefit companies like ACWA Power and AD Ports (both N) and the bond-proxy Utilities sector.UAE Real EstateTaher SafieddineOW: Aldar Properties, EmaarDevelopment, Emaar PropertiesWe expect property market momentum to continue into H2, further supporting off-plan sales for Emaar Development (OW) and Aldar (OW). We see further traction in recurring segments (commercial, retail and hospitality) as activity gathers pace post summer.",

Without China following through on capacity rationalization (through anti-involution), the supply/demand dynamics are unlikely to improve in the medium term. On fertilizers, urea prices remain high and the market is currently very tight, and supply/demand dynamics indicate structural tightening going forward given limited capacity additions and geopolitical risks to supply.

In addition, corporate guidance for FY'25 has been either maintained (AD Ports, Empower, Ma'aden) or modestly upgraded (Salik, ADNOC L&S), implying a decent outlook into the year- end. Over the past two months, the investor feedback we have received suggests: 1) overall a continued preference for UAE vs Saudi names (which looks in- line with our CEEMEA Equity Strategist's call of being OW UAE vs \"Neutral but vigilant\" KSA, here & here) and 2) relatively limited appetite and low conviction for the more cyclical and/or more capex- heavy and relatively less liquid Industrial and Transportation names amid lingering macro concerns. Most discussed names in our MENA coverage over the course of summer were ADNOC L&S (OW), Salik (N), ACWA Power (N) and Ma'aden (N).",

Among exporters, we see opportunities as domestic demand slows, with companies poised to benefit from favorable FX moves (EUR/USD), a low base in export volumes, and more visible margin repair in the second half of the year. Arcelik and Ford Otosan are standout companies likely to benefit from this backdrop, while Tofas may need a few more quarters to see the positive impact of its export ramp-up. For the food retail sector, the consumption slowdown, lower food inflation compared to CPI, and ongoing promotional activities pose challenges to revenue, creating downside risks to profitability. However, companies will cycle through different bases, with BIM benefiting from a low base and Migros (OW) facing a high base disadvantage for the remainder of the year. As the slowdown persists, staples lack the catalysts to drive their low valuation multiples for a few more quarters.",

Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex- Australia and ex- India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analyst's coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
