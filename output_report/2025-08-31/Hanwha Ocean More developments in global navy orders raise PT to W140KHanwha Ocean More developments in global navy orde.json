We are seeing heightened visibility for the defense opportunities in both the US and non- US regions, which we believe is the key valuation re- rating factor for the Korean shipbuilding sector. In the US, while we are still waiting for potential changes or exceptions to the Byrnes- Tollefson Amendment, for which the Korean shipbuilders are lobbying aggressively in the US, we believe the recent US- Korea summit (link) indicates that Korea will have a strong role in rebuilding US Navy capabilities. In overseas ex- US, Hanwha Ocean has been selected as a finalist in the W60T Canada submarine contract (along with German TKMS), where Hanwha has a competitive edge in delivery time. The Canadian prime minister will also make a visit to Hanwha's Geojie shipyard in October. We see a huge TAM in the global navy market, which amounts to \\(\\) 199B\\(as per our estimate (link to report), and we note that these orders would be margin accretive, given production domestically. We expect to see more developments around several naval orders in the short to mid term, including the Poland submarine order, ME orders for both surface ships and submarines, and Thailand frigate re- orders. We expect Hanwha Ocean's share price to be strongest in the near term with several order- related catalysts. With heightened visibility on naval orders, we raise our target price orderbook multiple to 0.87x (from 0.8x) and raise our PT to W140K. Reiterate OW.",

Other than the Canada order, we are also waiting for: 1) Poland submarine contract worth W8T, which should come out by year- end or early 2026 - better technology, price and delivery vs. European competitors and signing of MOU with local shipyard gives us confidence for an order win; 2) ME order for 5 units of surface ships, and 4 units of submarines with orders likely granted in 2026- 2027; 3) Thailand Trigate order worth c.
