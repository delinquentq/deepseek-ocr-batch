The company continues to focus on new products like TSV (Through Silicon Via) ECP (Electroplating) and slurry, and new clients across China and overseas to drive order growth. Meanwhile, the company is expanding capacity in Ningbo and Shanghai to offer platform solution (CMP slurry, wet chemicals, ECP and materials) for clients.
