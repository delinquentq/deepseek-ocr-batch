As of end-July, there were still c.600k HDTs at China IV or below emission standards in the fleet. 2) With the continuous decline in battery costs, increased support from the government for EV initiatives, and innovative marketing models, such as battery banks and policy-based leasing, the electric HDT market has entered an accelerated growth phase. 3) During 2017-21, China's HDT sales exceeded 1mn units p.a. for five consecutive years. Assuming an average replacement cycle of 8-10 years, this implies steady annual demand for fleet renewal. 4) Although Sinotruk expects China's HDT export sales to decline slightly YoY in 2025, mgmt expects the momentum to pick up over the next few years, as there remains substantial market potential in regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia. Notably, Sinotruk still targets 150k units of export sales in 2025, implying a 12% YoY rise.",

This efficiency rivals that of diesel trucks and is well suited for short-turn operations in ports and mining zones. 2) Cost: Plug-in charging is overall more economical over time. Battery-swapping HDTs use a chassis-only model with battery leasing, reducing initial purchase costs but requiring ongoing rental payments. 3) Infrastructure: battery swap stations cost more than RMB3mn each and face grid and land constraints. China has 8mn charging piles vs c.2000 battery swap stations for HDTs, with charging piles offering lower costs, faster approvals, and broader coverage. In 1H, battery swapping accounted for",
