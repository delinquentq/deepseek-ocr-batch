We do not view a September cut as a certainty — August payrolls of 225k and another clear acceleration in tariff- related inflation could keep them on hold. Conversely, we believe a larger up- front cut would come only with sizeable payroll declines. The Fed could also see dissents against rate cuts in September. read more",

China maintains its tilt toward investment while the US boosted household transfers post- Covid, leading to divergence in economic outcomes. China has experienced nine consecutive quarters of deflation, while inflation has remained above target in the US for the last four years. For China, anti- involution (i.e., efforts to diminish unproductive excess competition among enterprises) should help improve pricing power for select sectors but likely not in aggregate; persistent deflation is likely to keep the debt- to- GDP ratio rising. For the US, the fiscal policy setup is adding to overall policy uncertainty. Higher macro risk premium means the USD stays weak. read more",
