However, momentum has been weak in France for some time and we see this as pushing recovery to the right, rather than creating incremental weakness. While the Euro outlook is uncertain, it was worth flagging that US exceptionalism appears to be alive and well, as evidenced by the upgraded 3Q GDP Now forecast from the Atlanta Fed, see Chart 1.",
