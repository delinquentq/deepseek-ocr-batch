      "text": "Greer released its 2Q25 results (28 Aug), generally lower than the capital market's expectation, in our view. The company's quarterly revenue decreased \\(12.1\\%\\) y- y (leading to a 1H25 revenue decline of \\(2.7\\%\\) y- y), while quarterly core earnings decreased by a similar \\(11.9\\%\\) y- y to CNY8.2bn (1H25 core earnings up a marginal \\(0.6\\%\\) y- y). Greer continued to experience gross margin pressure in 2Q25 with another 0.6pp y- y decline in the past quarter (after a 1.4pp y- y decline in 1Q25), while the 2Q25 operating margin stayed flat y- y in 2Q25, partially due to the company's efforts to reduce costs/improve efficiency. In addition to the set of weak results (the slowest 2Q25 revenue/earnings growth among the three major home appliance names we cover), unlike most of its peers, Gree also did not declare any interim dividend, which could be perceived as another negative catalyst to Gree's share price, in our view.",

We expect the industry landscape will turn more competitive for the home appliances sector in domestic China in 2H25F (especially for air conditioners), considering the fading positive impact of the trade- in programs and potentially intensified price competition. Gree, given its less diversified business structure as compared to its other two major competitors, will face more sales/earnings pressure in 2H25F, in our view.",

We cut our target price to CNY52.70 (from CNY54.40), based on an unchanged 9.0x target F12M P/E applied to our end- Jun 26F earnings estimate (from end- FY25F previously). Our target price implies \\(24\\%\\) upside potential. Gree currently trades at a FY25F P/E of only 7.3x (EPS: CNY5.81); keep Buy rating on its undemanding valuation.
