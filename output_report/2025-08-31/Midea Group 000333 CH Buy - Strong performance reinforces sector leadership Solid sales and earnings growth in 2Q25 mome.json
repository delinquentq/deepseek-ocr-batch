Quarterly revenue increased by \\(11\\%\\) y- y to CNY124bn (1H25 revenue up \\(16\\%\\) y- y to CNY252bn, the fastest among the three major Chinese white goods players we cover), while quarterly core earnings increased \\(23\\%\\) y- y to CNY13.5bn (1H25 core earnings up a strong \\(30\\%\\) y- y to CNY26.2bn, notably outpacing major peers). The faster growth of earnings than revenue in 1H25 was mainly driven by: 1) the 0.8pp y- y improvement in Midea's operating margin thanks to its cost- saving efforts (despite a 0.7pp y- y decline in the interim gross margin), and 2) contribution from financial income in 1H25. Midea also declared an interim dividend of CNY0.5 per share; together with Midea's share repurchase plan (CNY4.4bn quota already used), we see the company's continued commitment to shareholder returns. Midea, in our view, will maintain its solid market share gain trajectory as well as earnings growth momentum in 2H25F given the company's diversified business lines and proven operating capabilities. Maintain Buy with a higher TP of CNY98.00.",

With a resilient net margin level (1H25: \\(10.3\\%\\) , higher than the company's targeted level of \\(c.10\\%\\) ), Midea will focus more on protecting its market share in 2H25F with swift and proactive measures. Given Midea's solid operating track record, we forecast the company should be able to maintain a FY25F net margin of \\(10.1\\%\\) amid its efforts to maintain its current sales momentum/market share, even if there is downward pressure on its gross margin in 2H25F.",
