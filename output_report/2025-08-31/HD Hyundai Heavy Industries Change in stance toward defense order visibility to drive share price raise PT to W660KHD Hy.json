      "text": "We raise our Dec- 26 PT from W590K to W660K, implying \\(27\\%\\) upside to the current share price. The company recently announced a merger with HD Hyundai Mipo (Mipo), hoping to change its business structure from commercial- centric to higher exposure to the navy business. This is a drastic change in the company's attitude towards the defense business, where the company is showing swift moves to fully utilize its key assets for naval fleet building. With the merger with Mipo, and opening of dock #5, the company will have a total annual capacity of c.12 units of surface vessels and 1 submarine, which should well serve the global navy TAM (link to report). We expect to hear more developments around the US navy business in the near term (changes in regulations) and more updates on global ex- US orders, which should be key share price catalysts. With heightened visibility for navy opportunities, we raise our target price to orderbook multiple to \\(0.89x\\) (from previous \\(0.8x\\) ) and raise our PT to W660K. Reiterate OW.",
