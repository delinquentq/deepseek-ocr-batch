Leaders continue to outperform versus peers eg Anjoy delivered c.6% yoy sales growth in 2Q25 vs national catering retail sales of c.4% yoy (above designated size at 2.6% yoy) and NPM stands at 7% while smaller frozen food player Qianwei missed GSe by 51% with sales/NP down 3%/42% yoy and Sanquan sales/OP missed by 2%/35% with sales/OP down 4%/39% yoy.",

We highlight key trend observed from our prepared food companies' comments: 1) sequential improvement into Aug albeit magnitude is still small; More new products are to be launched in 2H25; 2) stabilizing pricing trend noted in both small- to- B and major accounts, and companies generally would be more rational on the promotion or channel supports into 2H; 3) better performance recorded in 2C channel in 2Q which we attribute to more in- home consumption amid fluid catering; reformed KAs are now the key battlefields, while with tailor- made products and relatively high manufacturing cost, the margin is generally lower than Company average; 4) raw material cost trend divergent, and increases are mainly around protein eg beef and fish; companies do not expect further rising cost headwind in 2H.",
