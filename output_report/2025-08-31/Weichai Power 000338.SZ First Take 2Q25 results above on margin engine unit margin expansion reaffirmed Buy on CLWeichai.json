The long- term overhang from truck electrification has dominated our discussions with investors on the stock valuation, but we believe that Weichai's stronger cycle- overcycle earnings prospects (very rare within our China machinery coverage) has been underappreciated by the market. This differentiates our view, as our long- term earnings projection has modeled in higher peak engine sales volume and a unit net profit \\(>2x\\) vs. its long- term average. Moreover, we also expect a robust FCF profile ( \\(\\sim 10 - 20\\%\\) yield over 2025E- 27E), which along with a strong net cash position (c.1/4 of Weichai's market cap) should lead to increasing payouts (+5ppt p.a. towards \\(70\\%\\) GSe), further enhancing shareholder return.
