      "text": "Weichai Power reported 2Q25 results, which were better than feared, particularly given the sluggish industry HDT sales backdrop, as buyers were waiting for the implementation of China IV truck trade- in subsidies, which finally came through from late June. Despite the challenging market conditions, Weichai demonstrated resilience in its financial performance. Key highlights include impressive growth in AIDC engine sales, which surged \\(491\\%\\) Y/Y in 1H25, showcasing Weichai's strong market position and innovation capabilities. KION's strategic focus on significant order growth and advancements in AI and robotics, including its partnership with NVIDIA to integrate \"physical AI into industry, physical AI into the supply chain,\" represents a major leap in the logistics technology. Industry HDT sales have started to rebound in June- July, up \\(37\\%\\) and \\(42\\%\\) Y/Y, and are poised to remain strong for the remainder of the year. Notably, industry LNG truck sales started to pick up in July, up \\(20\\%\\) sequentially, with the penetration rate rising to \\(24\\%\\) from June's \\(20\\%\\) . Weichai's Op- CF in 2Q25 notably rebounded compared to 1Q25, and the interim payout ratio further rose to \\(57\\%\\) for 1H25, compared to \\(55\\%\\) in FY24, showcasing the strong intention for improving shareholder returns. With 2Q25 results cleared out of the way, we reiterate our OW rating on Weichai, reflecting confidence in its strategic initiatives and market position.",

In 1H25, Weichai recorded 362,000 units of engine sales, among which large- bore engines achieved total sales of over 5,000 units, growing \\(41\\%\\) Y/Y. Large- bore revenue was Rmb2.5B, up \\(73\\%\\) Y/Y. AIDC engines demonstrated robust performance, with sales surging \\(491\\%\\) Y/Y to achieve c600 units in 1H25, or c400 units in 2Q. This reflects Weichai's strong growth potential in the booming AIDC market, as Weichai is among the best- positioned domestic players to benefit from import substitution. The impressive growth in engine sales, particularly in the AIDC segment, highlights Weichai's strategic focus on innovation and market expansion. The significant increase in sales of M series large- bore engines indicates strong demand and successful penetration in key markets. The robust performance of AIDC engines underscores Weichai's ability to capitalize on emerging trends and technological advancements, positioning itself as a leader in the domestic market which is seeing strong growth prospects given China's catch- up AIDC investments led by the telecom and Internet companies.",

In July, industry HDT sales surged \\(42\\%\\) Y/Y, achieving 83,000 units, marking a significant recovery from the \\(3\\%\\) decline in 1Q25. The industry LNG HDT sales in July improved sequentially, rising \\(20\\%\\) M/M, and further recovering the LNG penetration rate to \\(24\\%\\) from below \\(20\\%\\) in June, despite being down \\(29\\%\\) Y/Y in 2Q25. The HDT demand recovery is a positive indicator for the industry, with a strong market rebound anticipated in the coming months given the low base effects. Weichai's subsidiary, Shaanxi Auto, reported 73,000 units in HDT sales in 1H25, an increase of \\(14.6\\%\\) Y/Y (outperforming the industry's \\(7\\%\\) growth), capturing a \\(13.5\\%\\) market share (highest level since 2021), with the resilient performance achieved despite the negative impact from the trade-in program. Shaanxi Auto's impressive growth in sales and market share reflects its competitive advantage and ability to outperform industry trends.",

In 1H25, China's industry new energy HDT sales surged \\(186\\%\\) Y/Y to achieve 79,000 units, with a penetration rate reaching \\(26\\%\\) in June. The strong growth in industry new energy HDT sales was partly due to the low base, which is expected to bump up from August/September onwards. Meanwhile, industry LNG HDT sales have started to pick up from July, up \\(20\\%\\) M/M, indicating a positive shift in market dynamics. The surge of electric HDTs in 2Q25 was viewed by most investors who we spoke during the recent global marketing trips as a key concern due to Weichai's lack of exposure, creating an overhang. However, Weichai has now addressed this concern with increased exposure in the new energy sector. Weichai's battery production sales surged in 2Q25, reconciling concerns over its lack of exposure in the EV space, and positioning the company well to capitalize on emerging trends in sustainable transportation solutions. Weichai's newly opened Yantai New Energy Industrial Park Phase I marks a significant milestone in the strategic transition, establishing a large-scale production base for new energy powertrains, electric motors, motor controllers, and batteries. In 1H25, Weichai's power battery sales reached 2.3GWh, marking an impressive Y/Y increase of \\(91\\%\\) . The strategic expansion of Weichai's battery production capabilities reflects its plan to providing high-end power solutions for new energy HDTs and construction machinery.",

In 2Q25, KION achieved an impressive order intake of €3,500MM, primarily driven by the SCS (Supply Chain Solutions) segment, highlighting its strong market position and ability to attract new business. The partnership with NVIDIA to integrate \"physical AI into industry, physical AI into the supply chain\" represents a major leap in robotics and AI, enhancing KION's supply chain solutions and positioning it as a leader in logistics technology. KION anticipates growth in the Industrial truck market across all regions, with stable Y/Y growth in APAC and recovery in the Americas, while expecting the warehouse automation market to grow slightly Y/Y. This positive outlook reflects KION's strategic focus on expanding product offerings and operational efficiency. The company's ability to navigate market fluctuations and capitalize on emerging opportunities underscores its strong leadership and strategic vision, setting a positive trajectory for FY25.",

      "text": "- 2Q25 results reflect resilience despite challenges in China's HDT market and a high comparison base. Weichai's 2Q25 revenue was flattish Y/Y, achieving Rmb55.7B. Gross profit slightly grew 1% Y/Y, driven by a 0.3ppts improvement in GPM, from 21.8% in 2Q24 to 22.1% in 2Q25. NPAT saw an 11% Y/Y decline, reaching Rmb2.9B. KION's 2Q25 restructuring expense was Rmb45MM, slightly impacting Weichai's NP by 16MM. However, excluding KION's one-off restructuring costs, Weichai's like-for-like NPAT would be up 21% Y/Y for 1H25, with NPM improving by 1.1ppts Y/Y, despite the high comparison base. The sluggish industry HDT sales, particularly industry LNG truck sales in 2Q25, were affected as buyers held back purchases in anticipation of the China IV HDT trade-in subsidy, which began in late June. Despite these challenges, Weichai's 2Q25 like-for-like profit was down only 10% Y/Y, much better than feared, as Street expectations were looking for a decline of over 15% Y/Y. Importantly, Weichai's Op-CF in 2Q25 rebounded significantly compared to 1Q25, and KION's order intake was strong, up 22% Y/Y, indicating a positive outlook for the remainder of the year. The company's strategic focus on maintaining a stable revenue stream while enhancing profitability through improved gross margins is evident. Despite the decline in NPAT, Weichai's commitment to shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases reflects a robust financial strategy aimed at long-term growth and stability. The restructuring expenses incurred by KION, although impacting net profit, are part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and enhance efficiency, which is expected to yield positive results in the future.",

GPM of the complete vehicle business achieved 19.1% in 1H25, improving 0.9ppts from 1H24. KION reported a 2% decline in revenue, reaching Rmb43.2B. Despite the slight revenue decline, the segment's GPM improved 0.5ppts to 27.4% (1H24: 26.9%). KION's new order rose 22% Y/Y, marking a historical highest level for 2Qs. Revenue from agricultural equipment slightly declined 3% Y/Y to Rmb10.3B in 1H25, within which the export sales grew 19% Y/Y, reflecting solid demand in the overseas market. The performance across various segments highlights Weichai's diversified business model, which allows it to leverage growth opportunities in different areas. The improvement in gross margins across segments indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency. The growth in export sales for agricultural equipment underscores the company's ability to tap into international markets, thereby mitigating domestic market fluctuations. KION's historical high in new orders is testament to its strong market position and ability to attract new business, which bodes well for future revenue growth.",

NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In Americas equity research, some stocks under coverage have a rating but no price target; in these cases, we expect the stock will outperform/perform in line/underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe over the next six to 12 months. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid- cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those Research Analyst's coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
