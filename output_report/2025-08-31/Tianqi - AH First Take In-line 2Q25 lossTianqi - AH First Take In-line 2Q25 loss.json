In 2Q25, Tianqi recorded a Rmb20mn loss (vs Rmb104 net earnings in 1Q25 and a Rmb1.3bn loss in 2Q24), in- line with its preannouncement. Unit GP of spodumene and lithium carbonate trended lower on weak prices, as both spodumene and lithium carbonate prices both dropped by \\(\\sim 13\\%\\) in 2Q25. Non- recurring items included a Rmb158mn impairment. We believe the recent mining license renewal approval in Jiangxi is a stronger share price driver than the set of in- line results.",
