Key negatives include: NIM contraction of - 4bps q/q, sequential loan and deposit contraction, and a slight deterioration in asset quality. The NPL and SML ratios picked up by 2bps/3bps q/q, NPL formation ratio increased by 24bps y/y to \\(1.51\\%\\) , while Minsheng's NPL coverage ratio (i.e.: \\(145\\%\\) at 2Q) remained the weakest among peers. On the positive side, the capital ratio slightly improved, and robust non- NII growth helped to support revenue growth ( \\(8\\%\\) y/y in 2Q, the highest level since 2Q20). We expect the share price to react neutral to slightly negative to this set of results given the slow business growth and weakening asset quality.",

MSE has a higher lending yield than average loans, and we expect Minsheng to increase the unsecured portion of MSE loans, which could drive up NIM and revenue for Minsheng.- Management is conservative about business growth as macro conditions are yet to fully recover. Thus, the revenue trend could remain weak in the near term.- Weak provision level. Minsheng's NPL coverage ratio of \\(145\\%\\) for 2024 was the weakest among banks under our coverage.
