      "text": "After market close on August 29, Seino HD released its monthly truck data for July 2025. Daily cargo volume declined \\(0.5\\%\\) YoY, while unit price rose \\(4.0\\%\\) YoY. Our initial impression is mildly negative. (1) Daily cargo volume is in line with our expectations and does not raise concerns. However, compared to the company's 1H F3/26 (- 0.7%), it appears to be tracking slightly ahead. (2) Unit price has been trending below both our expectations and the company's 1H plan (+4.5% YoY) since June 2025. Considering the YoY growth trend of charter spot freight rates, which typically lead the company's unit price growth by about six months (see related report), this does not seem anomalous. For now, a slowdown in Seino's unit price growth appears inevitable. (3) On a consolidated basis, while downside risk to unit price versus company plan seems unavoidable, potential upside from MD Logistics and the automotive sales business suggests that there is no need to be concerned about the company missing its full- year consolidated OP guidance.",
