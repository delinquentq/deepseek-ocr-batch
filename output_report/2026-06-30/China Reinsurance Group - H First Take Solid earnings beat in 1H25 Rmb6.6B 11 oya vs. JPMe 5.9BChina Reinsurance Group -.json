We anticipate a positive market response to the company's result. First, the company reported Rmb6.6B of 1H25 net profit (11% oya), which exceeded our forecast (Rmb5.9B). The earnings beat was largely supported by favorable combined ratio management, with ratios below \\(100\\%\\) across major segments. As 1H25 net profit accounts for \\(67\\%\\) of the annual earnings consensus, we foresee potential for upward earnings revisions. Second, management reaffirmed the product portfolio shift towards more profitable overseas business in a prudent manner, and its confidence in achieving underwriting profit amidst softening reinsurance pricing. Third, solvency capital remains robust (Group's Jun- 25 core solvency: \\(161\\%\\) , \\(+2\\%\\) p H/H) with a \\(3.7\\%\\) H/H increase in book value. We believe that the solid earnings beat and consensus revisions could drive share outperformance. Stay OW.",

We think the earnings base was largely underpinned by an impressive management of the combined ratio. Despite the global insured catastrophic loss in 1H25 reaching the highest level (US100B+) over the past decade, which exerted certain pressure on the claim ratio, the company sustained a favorable combined ratio of overseas reinsurance business and Chaucer business at \\(100.1\\% /84.4\\%\\) , respectively. Regarding the scaling of the Chaucer business, management noted that the company is likely to pursue prudent underwriting selection, further enhancing its resilience against catastrophic fluctuations. Moreover, the softening global reinsurance pricing cycle may not weigh on the underwriting business, as the company believes that current pricing still reserves sufficient buffer to generate plausible underwriting profit.",
